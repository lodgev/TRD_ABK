 LFC CHRISTMAS GIFTS Harvey Elliott has displayed his ever-improving maturity and team ethic, insisting that the team comes first in his search for more regular playing time. The 21-year-old has suffered a frustrating season to date, not starting a single game for Liverpool due to injury problems. Elliott broke his foot on England under-21 duty back in September and only returned to the fold earlier this month. On Saturday, the midfielder was introduced as a second-half substitute in Liverpool’s 2-2 draw at home to Fulham, coming within inches of curling home against his former club.  Speaking to LFCTV, Elliott made it clear that the team comes first, even though he would clearly love to be more of a key man under Arne Slot. “It’s just about waiting for your time,” Elliott said. “We’re a squad, we’re a team. Some games you might not be needed and [others], for example like today, players are needed. “Like Jots, just come back from injury and he got the equaliser. We all have to be ready, we all have to be prepared to come on and impact the game, impact the team.   “We’re all together as one, we’re a squad and we’re going to need everyone.” Elliott also discussed the never-say-die attitude of this Liverpool side, as they twice came from behind with 10 men to earn a draw on Saturday. “Coming from behind to get the draw, as much as we want the win, I think we should be proud of ourselves,” he added. “We could have won it as well but a draw is better than a loss, even though we wanted three points. If we want to go far this season, this is what we need to do.   “When times are tough, we need to show as a team and as a club that we’re going to fight for everything and I think today was a prime example of that.” Elliott has a tough job on his hands breaking into Liverpool’s strongest XI, given the level of midfield depth at Slot’s disposal. The boyhood Reds supporter lacks the dynamism of Ryan Gravenberch, Dominik Szoboszlai and Curtis Jones, which works against him, but he arguably possesses more guile than any of them.  Elliott’s ability to weave his magic in tight spaces and pick out a pass is a potent weapon, with the youngster completing all three of his long balls in his short cameo on Saturday, per FotMob. He will know that there is huge competition for places, however, and he will have to bide his time, especially after such a lengthy injury absence. It’s easy to forget that only Darwin Nunez (54) made more appearances for Liverpool last season than Elliott (53), but it’s now a case of nailing down that precious starting berth more regularly.

 LFC CHRISTMAS GIFTS Liverpool legend Craig Johnston was in tears after making a long-awaited return to Anfield on Saturday, describing how “emotional” an occasion it was. The Australian winger was a hugely popular figure for the Reds between 1981 and 1988, playing a major role during a trophy-laden period. Johnston made 271 appearances, scoring 40 goals and registering 39 assists, winning five First Division titles and one European Cup, among other trophies. • READ: LFC legend retired early before inventing world’s most popular football boot He also famously scored against Everton in the 1986 FA Cup final, netting in a 3-1 win for the Reds, which was always going to etch his name into the club’s history. Johnston has only made very sporadic returns to Anfield in the decades since, having been forced to leave and return to Australia to look after his ill sister, who suffered a brain injury.  One such trip took place on Saturday, and speaking to LFCTV before Liverpool’s 2-2 draw at home to Fulham, the visibly emotional 64-year-old discussed how special it was being back. “Just hearing you speak makes it emotional,” Johnston said.  “I kind of left in a bit of a hurry and obviously there is obviously a lot of stuff underneath that I never talked about and never discussed and never been back. “So unfortunately it is emotional. People might think I’m a bit soft, I’m not soft. I just appreciate living in this city for so long, nine years, and all of the stuff that happened while I was here. It’s just magic. “I can’t find the words sometimes to describe it. But it’s certainly emotional.   “But once I get through the emotion, I’m OK. But just hearing your voice and being here, it just makes it very real, you know?” While clearly a poignant afternoon for Johnston, he still had time to poke fun at his former teammates, when asked about meeting up with them again. “I won’t be emotional about seeing them, I’ll knock them out actually, some of them!” he joked. “Some of them owe me money, so that’s a different thing.  “The city, the culture, that time frame where we were the best in the world by a long, long way. That’s the stuff that gets me.” It is touching to see Johnston so moved at being back at Anfield, highlighting why Liverpool is such a special club that stays in players’ hearts long after they have left. Unfortunately, Arne Slot‘s Reds side couldn’t produce a win against Fulham on the former winger’s return, but he will hopefully have had a day to treasure.

 LFC CHRISTMAS GIFTS Liverpool U18s signed off for their winter break with an emphatic 4-2 victory over Wolves, with defender Lucas Clarke debuting days after his move from Man City. U18 Premier League | AXA Training Centre
December 14, 2024 Goals: Sonni-Lambie 23′, Furnell-Gill 29′, Bradshaw 64′ 90+5′; Mane 45+2′, Olagunju 90+1′ The young Reds knew heading into the visit of Wolves to Kirkby that they would not play again for almost a month, with academy fixtures typically taking a break over Christmas. That put the onus on Marc Bridge-Wilkinson’s players to sign off on 2024 on a high – and they certainly managed that. It was a side of mixed experience, including striker Prince Kobe Cisse in an experimental role at right-back, 15-year-old Cam Williams at left-back and both Luca Furnell-Gill and Joe Upton making their first starts in over a month.  But it was also one furnished with talent, as showed with Liverpool taking a 2-0 lead within the first half-hour, first through Josh Sonni-Lambie and then centre-back Furnell-Gill. Wolves grabbed one back before the break through Mateus Mane, but it was clear that the young Reds were in the ascendency with Rio Ngumoha particularly dangerous. HT: Liverpool U18s 2-1 Wolves U18s  Mane looked to grab an equaliser after a brilliant run soon after the restart, but it was Joe Bradshaw who found the back of the net next, the winger making it 3-1 to Liverpool as his shot deflected in. Bridge-Wilkinson made his first change at the break, with returning midfielder Fola Onanuga’s minutes managed with the introduction of Ollie O’Connor, before another substitute made his Liverpool debut on the hour. Clarke, a 16-year-old centre-back, replaced captain Lucas Pitt just three days after announcing his switch from Man City – and the new scholar made a stunning goal-line clearance soon after coming on.   A post shared by Lucas Clarke (@lucasjclarke_)  Furnell-Gill and Ngumoha both had chances to put the game to bed only to be thwarted by Wolves goalkeeper Josh Gracey, but a red card for their defender Myles Dayman set up a chaotic finale. Even with 10 men, Wolves managed to grab one back through Saheed Olagunju, but Bradshaw got his second of the afternoon before full-time to secure a 4-2 win. It capped an excellent first half of the season for Bradshaw, 16, who has now scored six goals and laid on two assists in his last five league games.  In all competitions this season Bradshaw has nine goals and two assists in 16 games, with no player scoring more for Liverpool U18s. The youngsters will now continue to train and likely take in behind-closed-doors friendlies at the AXA Training Centre, but also be given valuable time off with their families before play resumes with the visit of Nottingham Forest on January 11. Liverpool U18s: Hall; Cisse, Furnell-Gill, Pitt (Clarke 58′), Williams; Upton, Onanuga (O’Connor 46′); Bradshaw, Ahmed, Ngumoha; Sonni-Lambie Subs not used: Bernard, Lonmeni, Martin Next match: Nottingham Forest (A) – U18 Premier League – Saturday, January 11, 12pm (GMT) Get our free app © Copyright This Is Anfield 2024",

 LFC CHRISTMAS GIFTS Dominik Szoboszlai‘s influence on this Liverpool side is often felt most when he isn’t in the team – but the Hungarian was key with 10 men against Fulham. In many ways, the role Szoboszlai is playing for Arne Slot‘s successful side is similar to that of Gini Wijnaldum under the head coach’s predecessor. Wijnaldum was known as a supreme attacking player when he arrived at Anfield in 2016, but was forced to curb those tendencies until international duty as he instead held things together in midfield. Under Slot, Szoboszlai is similarly, quietly influential, his industry in the middle of the park key to maintaining the control the Dutchman relishes. As stats from FotMob show, that was again evident in Saturday’s 2-2 draw with Fulham, with Liverpool spending 89 minutes – including stoppage time – with 10 men after Andy Robertson‘s red card.    Interestingly, in the 17 minutes leading up to Robertson’s dismissal, no player touched the ball fewer times than Szoboszlai, who saw possession just once. That resulted in a simple 10-yard pass. But by the end of the game, it was only those in Slot’s reshuffled back line – Ryan Gravenberch (83), Trent Alexander-Arnold (83), Virgil van Dijk (83) and Joe Gomez (80) – who had more touches than Szoboszlai (54). Gravenberch (eight), who excelled after dropping into defence, was the only player to win more duels, with Szoboszlai ending the game tied with Gomez, Cody Gakpo and substitute Diogo Jota on five. Szoboszlai also drew the joint-most fouls (two) and won the joint-most tackles (two) with a 100 percent success rate. Only Alisson (10) and Gravenberch (eight) made more ball recoveries (six) which, given the differences in their roles, highlights how effective Liverpool’s No. 8 was in hoovering up possession in midfield.  That is particularly impressive given the Reds were effectively short one midfielder as Gravenberch moved into the back line after Robertson’s red card, with Slot calling on Szoboszlai and Curtis Jones to perform the job of three men. Not only did they do so, then, but Szoboszlai also created more chances than any other Liverpool player (three), combining that relentless energy with a much-needed cutting edge with crisp passing into the final third. And to magnify that, his excellent numbers come despite being substituted in the 79th minute – and Jones shortly beforehand – as Slot rightly acknowledged the physical toll on his midfielders.  The shift Szoboszlai has put in today. I'm tired just watching him. — Sam McGuire (@SamMcGuire90) December 14, 2024   Szoboszlai done the work of about 4 men today, never seen a player work that hard before. — Anfield Sector (@AnfieldSector) December 14, 2024   Dominik Szoboszlai was exceptional yet again, relentless workrate with the extra running required while trying to create chances. Gave absolutely everything again. pic.twitter.com/NmmhENCrHo — Samuel (@SamueILFC) December 14, 2024   The amount of running Szoboszlai and Jones are doing is insane. Respect — ~ (@TheLfcKop) December 14, 2024   Admittedly don't watch football to the detail I used to but that was the best I've seen Szoboszlai play for us — R8 ?? (@Nabyllionaire) December 14, 2024  While it may not be what most expected from Szoboszlai when he made his £60 million move from RB Leipzig last year, performances like these show that he is invaluable to Slot’s Liverpool. The Reds could have wilted with 10 men but the team pulled together and produced an outstanding display that deserved three points – with their man in the middle the glue once again.

 LFC CHRISTMAS GIFTS Fulham manager Marco Silva produced a strange response to being asked about red card decisions against Liverpool, fuming at a reporter in the process. The Reds had every right to feel aggrieved at some of the calls that went against them on Saturday, not least a dreadful tackle from Andreas Pereira on Ryan Gravenberch. The Fulham midfielder raked the Achilles of the Dutchman but only received a yellow card, prior to then opening the scoring for the visitors. The performance of referee Tony Harrington and VAR left a lot to be desired, with the home crowd fuming at various decisions, feeling that Fulham got the rub of the green.    ""If you're asking me about 50/50 moments we are going to be here all afternoon talking, and not about the game"" ? Marco Silva was NOT happy when asked if Issa Diop or Andreas Pereira should have been given red cards ? pic.twitter.com/702KQNEcIb — Sky Sports Premier League (@SkySportsPL) December 14, 2024  Despite this, a very defensive Silva bizarrely reacted in spiky fashion when a reporter asked him if he felt his side benefited from decisions. “You think? Yeah?!” said Silva. “And the fouls from Liverpool, they are not close to red cards, no? “I didn’t see these moments, but you have all of them. If I go inside, I can probably give you some more 50/50 decisions from the referee, but you have two [tackles from Diop and Pereira].   “If you go through the whole game, you are going to see 50/50s against them, for sure. “I want to talk about the game, but if you are asking me about two 50/50 moments, we are going to be here all afternoon.  “It’s better to talk about the game. It’s tough to play at Anfield and I think our guys did really well.”  All managers are biased and will naturally stick up for their own team, but Silva’s reaction was still strange.  While rival supporters naturally like to think Liverpool constantly benefit from refereeing decisions at Anfield, the more it appears as though officials turn up looking to do the opposite. Pereira’s aforementioned tackle on Gravenberch was somehow not upgraded to a red card after a VAR check, and other bad calls went against the Reds, including a clear foul on Joe Gomez inside the box. Quite what Silva feels he has to be angry about remains to be seen, but he should feel that his team were fortunate to have 11 men on the pitch throughout.

 LFC CHRISTMAS GIFTS Ryan Gravenberch produced an outstanding performance in Liverpool’s 2-2 draw with Fulham, with his quality lauded by Arne Slot and Reds supporters alike. Two points may have been dropped at Anfield on Saturday, but the fact that Liverpool came from 1-0 and 2-1 down with 10 men made it a solid result overall. Andy Robertson‘s red card forced Slot into some key tactical changes, with the Dutchman admitting that briefly playing Cody Gakpo at left-back didn’t work. His decision to drop Gravenberch into a centre-back role was inspired, however, with the 22-year-old excelling there, as well as in midfield later on. He completed 96 percent of his passes, per FotMob, as well as making eight recoveries and driving Liverpool forward in the second half. Gravenberch’s display caught the eye of plenty of Reds supporters on X, as his fantastic season continues.  Gravenberch ran the show from CB DM RB LB you name it. Generational talent pic.twitter.com/uuC07GqOCa — Sibi (@SibiLFC) December 14, 2024   Jota praise is everywhere, and rightfully so.

(@disgame23) December 14, 2024   Ryan Gravenberch, I’m running out of words to describe him. He was playing both DM and CB all game and was exceptional again. — Samuel (@SamueILFC) December 14, 2024  Gravenberch’s superb performance wasn’t lost on Slot either, with Liverpool’s head coach hailing his brilliance in a rare role.  “Impressed, like everyone else at the stadium or the ones who saw the game,” Slot said. “Ryan did outstanding, again today. Without the ball, he was mostly in the last line. Had to play sometimes against the number nine and wingers who are really fast.  “And with the ball, he came into the midfield. Outstanding performance from him.” There has been so much to love about Liverpool since Slot has come in, but the rise of Gravenberch has been one of the most pleasing and exciting aspects of the season. After a hit-and-miss first year in a Reds shirt, he has been sensational in 2024/25, starting every Premier League game and looking like one of Europe’s best midfielders. If there were doubts about Gravenberch’s personality holding him back and not reaching his potential, following a failed spell at Bayern Munich, his work ethic against Fulham dispelled that myth.  The Dutchman covered so much ground alongside Dominik Szoboszlai and Curtis Jones when in midfield, but his class in defence was even more impressive. Gravenberch displayed his intelligence and adaptability, slotting into a centre-back role with so much ease that you could be forgiven for thinking he has always been a defender.  At just 22, there is so much more to come, and the current signs suggest Liverpool have a superstar in the making.   Get our free app © Copyright This Is Anfield 2024",

 LFC CHRISTMAS GIFTS There were certainly a lot to process after Liverpool’s 2-2 dramatic draw with Fulham on Saturday, with fans forgiven for missing plenty on and off the pitch. After two convincing red card shouts for fouls from Fulham players and an early dismissal for Andy Robertson, it was a chaotic afternoon at Anfield. Though they only emerged with a point from game which, before kickoff, they had been expected to win, Arne Slot and his players will likely have come away with it buoyed by the result. The highlights packages could only catch so much between Andreas Pereira’s opener and Diogo Jota‘s late equaliser – so here are five things you may have missed.   One of many positives on a rollercoaster afternoon, Federico Chiesa made his return to the matchday squad for the first time since September after a lengthy series of injuries. The Italian was not called upon – no doubt due to the tense nature of the tie – but he savoured his watching brief from the bench.  Fede was a live wire all match. Even though he didn’t get on the pitch today, I can safely say he’s improved his fitness levels! #LFC pic.twitter.com/t6nuOZAg2G — Asim (@asim_lfc) December 14, 2024  Even after three months out, he still hasn’t lost that enthusiasm!    ? | Arne Slot counting how long Leno had the ball in his hands for was something! ??? pic.twitter.com/znIJXVE94z — LFC Transfer Room (@LFCTransferRoom) December 14, 2024  One of the many subplots to Saturday’s draw was a booking for Slot which will ban him from the touchline for Wednesday’s Carabao Cup quarter-final at Southampton. In the grand scheme of things, it may have been an ideal fixture for the head coach to watch from the stands, with a number of changes likely as he preserves key names. Slot was clearly frustrated with the relatively inexperienced referee Tony Harrington throughout – and even helped him count how many seconds Fulham goalkeeper Bernd Leno spent time-wasting at one point.     0 red cards. pic.twitter.com/RkFqbMg3Up — – (@AnfieldRd96) December 14, 2024  Fulham boss Marco Silva was outraged when, in his post-match interview with Sky Sports, it was put to him that both Pereira and defender Issa Diop could have been shown red cards. Two studs-up challenges – Diop on Robertson and then Pereira on Ryan Gravenberch – were waved away by VAR with Harrington only booking both players. But quite how Fulham got away with both is baffling.   Not only should Fulham have gone down to at least 10 men, but some fans felt Liverpool should have been awarded a penalty too. Penalty for gomez here pic.twitter.com/xAA3M9Wxuc — Hayder (@evdj59) December 14, 2024   With Cody Gakpo firing a shot on goal in the second half, Fulham right-back Kenny Tete attempted a block and, in doing so, took out the onrushing Joe Gomez. It was ultimately given as a foul for Fulham, with Gomez adjudged to have taken out Tete, though fans were quick to point out that it would likely have gone the other way anywhere else on the pitch.    Didn’t even see this angle before ? pic.twitter.com/wpn3lQE4J3 — The Redmen TV (@TheRedmenTV) December 14, 2024  It is easy to criticise watching on from the stands, at home or at the pub, and particularly with the benefit of hindsight, but Luis Diaz missed a clear opening for Mo Salah at 2-2. As the ball broke to Diaz on the edge of the box in the third minute of stoppage time, the Colombian had a pass on for the wide-open Salah. Instead, he looked to dribble into space for a shot of his own, twice cutting onto his favoured left foot before firing a weak effort that was easily blocked. While Salah still would have had to finish the chance, in all likelihood, if Diaz had found him, he would have scored and Liverpool would have won 3-2. Fine margins indeed!

 LFC CHRISTMAS GIFTS Liverpool were on the receiving end of some poor decisions against Fulham, with former referee Mike Dean arguing one huge mistake was made by VAR. The Reds could only draw 2-2 at home to the Cottagers on Saturday afternoon, but there were positives to take from an exciting Premier League clash. Andy Robertson was sent off in the 17th minute, but Liverpool displayed their powers of recovery once again, twice coming from behind to secure a hard-earned point. While Robertson’s red card was fully warranted, following a last-ditch foul on former Liverpool player Harry Wilson, one extremely questionable decision happened beforehand. Andrea Pereira’s shocking tackle on Ryan Gravenberch was only deemed to be a yellow card, despite replays clearly showing that he had raked the Achilles of the Dutchman.  Andreas Pereira gives Fulham the lead over Liverpool ? Mike Dean believes he should have had a red card… pic.twitter.com/VmBnQcMXsJ — Sky Sports Premier League (@SkySportsPL) December 14, 2024  Salt was rubbed into Liverpool’s wounds when Pereira opened the scoring, and speaking on Sky Sports’ Soccer Saturday, Dean admitted that he shouldn’t have even been on the pitch. “He’s caught him just above the Achilles and scraped down to the top of his boot. In my opinion, he’s nowhere near the ball,” he said. “He knew what he was doing for me and it should have been 100 percent a red card.”  That’s the most embarrassing refereeing performance I’ve ever seen. Is this what we’re get now because their mate’s been sacked? — Ian Salmon (@IanRSalmon) December 14, 2024  This is just another reminder of the level of ineptitude among Premier League referees, with baffling decisions being made on a weekly basis. Quite how Stuart Attwell in the VAR booth could look back at Pereira’s tackle and not see it as a red card offence is unfathomable. While clearly the standout poor decision of the day, Tony Harrington’s performance as referee was generally among the poorest of the season.  Joe Gomez was clearly fouled inside the penalty area during the second half, only for nothing to be given, and the Anfield crowd was left fuming with constant iffy calls.  Premier League titles are so often won by fine margins, and the decision not to show Pereira a red card ultimately played a big part in the result. Had the correct call been made, Fulham would have been down to 10 men and Liverpool would likely have won with ease, so Arne Slot has every right to fume.

 LFC CHRISTMAS GIFTS Arne Slot has admitted that briefly using Cody Gakpo as a left-back in the 2-2 draw at home to Fulham was a tactical change that backfired. The Reds were held at Anfield on Saturday, dropping key points in the Premier League, but they battled bravely with 10 men after Andy Robertson was sent-off in the 17th minute. Slot got a spirited and energetic performance out of his players in trying circumstances, but one tactical tweak with a man down didn’t work. Speaking in his post-match press conference, Slot was quick to admit that moving Gakpo to left-back didn’t pan out the way he hoped, as he took little time to abandon the decision.  “It always depends on the players you have available, how you are going to react to that,” Slot said. “Are you one goal down, are you one goal up? So, that makes a difference.  “If you are one goal up, you might consider to defend with a lot of players, so then I might have considered to bring immediately a defender in. But if you are one goal down, you see differently.   “So first you take a look at the tactics board and you think, ‘this might be a good option’. That’s what we did for five minutes.  “But then looking at it, it looked better on a tactics board than on the pitch with Cody being a left-back!”  The fact that Slot said all of this with a smile suggests that he was in good spirits after the game, despite the result. He will know how much effort his team put into twice coming from behind with a man down, and their refusal to lie down bodes well for the rest of the season. It’s refreshing to see Slot be so honest about making a tactical error, too, as he continues to carry himself so impressively as Liverpool’s head coach.   Ultimately, the Dutchman corrected his decision and ensured his side outplayed Fulham for large periods, highlighting his ability to make quick tweaks during games. It’s safe to say we won’t be seeing Gakpo at left-back again, though! Get our free app © Copyright This Is Anfield 2024",

 LFC CHRISTMAS GIFTS The media reacted to Liverpool’s 2-2 draw against Fulham at Anfield with more praise than condemnation as the Reds battled with 10 men for over 70 minutes. While the Reds were far from perfect against Fulham, particularly in the full-back areas, Arne Slot and the media reacted positively to the team’s performance.  After Arsenal also drew on Saturday, Liverpool remain six points above the Gunners and five above Chelsea, with a game in hand over the former. Here’s how the media reacted to a hard-fought point at Anfield for both sides.    With the Reds losing a man, Slot opted to stick with the players already on the pitch to get Liverpool back in the game.  Harry Poole of BBC Sport looked at how Ryan Gravenberch‘s versatility was key to that: “Liverpool, with Ryan Gravenberch deployed as makeshift centre-back, stuck to their task, despite Fulham‘s ever-present threat on the counter-attack, and ended the first half with 61 percent possession. “Manager Arne Slot watched his side take reward for their aggressive start after the break, courtesy of Salah’s quality delivery to the back post. “But even that moment was not without an element of drama as VAR reviewed – but cleared – a potential foul by Luis Diaz on Kenny Tete before Gakpo finished. “To Liverpool’s credit there was little evidence of their numerical deficit as they chased a winner, but they once again faced an uphill task after Muniz guided in a cut-back by the excellent Robinson.” Amos Murphy of the Express was also full of praise for the 22-year-old midfielder: “Bossed the contest throughout, even after being asked to drop into defence following Robertson’s red card. Slowly emerging as one of the Player of the Season contenders, for both club and the wider league’s award.”    Andy Hunter of the Guardian felt Liverpool’s resilience was to be applauded as they twice came from behind against the Cottagers: “In the cold light of a relentless title race Liverpool may consider this a disappointing draw. The reality of a gruelling assignment against Fulham, and the atmosphere inside Anfield, told otherwise.  “Down to 10 men after 16 minutes, and 2-1 down until the 85th minute, Arne Slot’s Premier League leaders fought, pressed and attacked until the very last. Victory eluded Liverpool, but the performance will sustain them.”  Lewis Steele of Mail felt the game turned into more of a mental fight than clash of technical ability: “This was a game not about skill but mentality. It was about the ability to pull oneself up off the canvas and wrest back enough belief to rally in the face of adversity. “Liverpool and Fulham were going at it like two bruised fighters in a 12-round bout, one dizzied by the black eye of an early blow, each taking it in turns to take their lumps and looking ready to throw in the towel. “But ultimately neither refused to give up. And ultimately neither landed that crucial knockout blow, as 10-man Liverpool twice fought from behind to earn a battling draw thanks to substitute Diogo Jota coming back with a bang to equalise on 86 minutes.” Meanwhile, PA journalist Carl Markham wrote on X: “The disappointment of 10 men at not winning showed just how much effort they put into pushing for victory against the odds. But a point gained and still a healthy lead at the top.”    Ian Doyle of the Liverpool Echo felt very positively about Liverpool’s performance, saying it “cannot be regarded as anything other than a point gained.” Doyle wrote: “In truth, it (the point) was no less than Liverpool deserved for the manner in which they overcame the shock of first going behind and then Robertson’s red card. “While the result was unexpected, the performance, particularly in the second half, was that of a team with the character and quality – helped by some brave tactical decisions by Slot – to challenge for the Premier League title.  “If there were any lingering doubts, they have surely now been banished.  “Given the circumstances, this cannot be regarded as anything other than a point gained for Liverpool that could prove so crucial in the final analysis. And in Jota, the Reds have their most devastating finisher back firing.” Get our free app © Copyright This Is Anfield 2024",

 LFC CHRISTMAS GIFTS Ryan Gravenberch was the pick of Liverpool’s players in their 2-2 draw at home to Fulham, with many producing spirited performances after going down to 10 men. The Reds fell behind to an Andreas Pereira goal, with Andy Robertson‘s red card soon after compounding the hosts’ misery. Cody Gakpo equalised early in the second half, but while Arne Slot‘s side searched for an unlikely win, Rodrigo Muniz put Fulham back in front.  There was still time for substitute Diogo Jota to make it 2-2, but neither side could find a winner. Here we compare our player ratings with those of the Liverpool Echo, GOAL, FotMob and TIA’s readers.  It was Gravenberch (7.8) who impressed the most at Anfield, starring as both a midfielder and a centre-back. The Dutchman was forced into an auxiliary role because of Robertson’s red card, but he was superb there. This Is Anfield‘s Mark Delgado gave Gravenberch the Man of the Match award, saying one “cut-out after the hour mark was sensational.” Meanwhile, the Echo‘s Ian Doyle said that the 22-year-old’s “composure and ability to read the game saw him impress.” Gakpo (7.5) made it 1-1 with a well-taken header and he was another Dutch player who caught the eye at Anfield.  The forward’s “smart passes and dangerous diagonal balls” were lauded by GOAL’s Peter McVitie, while FotMob noted that he won five of his seven duels, the joint-third most. Dominik Szoboszlai (7.2) was another eye-catching performer for Liverpool, bringing vital industry when down to 10 men. The Hungarian “delivered a few lovely balls into the box,” in the words of Delgado, while Doyle said he “raised his level in response to the red card.” Unsurprisingly, Robertson got the lowest score (2.7), with McVitie brutally handing him a one-out-of-10 rating.

Yamal signalled to come off in the first half and appeared to be really struggling. However, he stayed on and ended up playing 75 minutes at Montjuic. Sorg was asked about Yamal after the game and offered the following update. “Lamine decided that he was fine and could continue playing. I cannot say that he is fine, we will have to wait for the medical team’s examination,” he told reporters. Sorg was also asked about the result and was at a loss to explain the defeat. “It’s very hard to understand this defeat. The first problem was the lack of concentration in the first five minutes of the match. We conceded that first goal. We had 20 chances despite not playing a good match but we didn’t score. It’s difficult to win like this,” he said. “We have to learn from this. We have played many demanding matches in a few days and the team is not used to this. We have to work on it.” Barcelona now have a free week to prepare for their next game against Atletico Madrid in La Liga.  Check your inbox for a welcome email. Oops. Something went wrong.

Barcelona, of course, marked their return to action a short time ago. In the knowledge that they had been joined atop the La Liga table by Atlético Madrid, Hansi Flick’s troops welcomed the aforementioned Leganés to Catalunya’s capital, eyeing just a 2nd league win in six. When all was said and done, however, the Blaugrana’s alarming domestic slide only continued. This came as a solitary goal on the part of the visitors’ Sergio González, netted inside the opening five minutes, proved the game’s decisive moment. Despite having looked some way short of their fluent best over the course of the 90 minutes tonight, Barcelona did manage to carve out a number of very presentable goalscoring opportunities. Time and time again, however, wasteful finishing cost the Catalans dear. And one individual who could not hide his frustration with as much, post-match, was Pedri. Speaking to the media on the back of the full-time whistle at Montjuïc, Barca’s midfield star admitted: “This is a big disappointment. I think we started the match without concentration. It’s clear.

This, of course, comes fresh off another outing to forget for Barcelona on Sunday. After welcoming Leganés to Catalunya’s capital for a league clash, the Blaugrana were ultimately put to the sword by a goal to nil. This, all told, means that Barca have now managed to emerge triumphant from just one of their last six domestic outings. As much has opened the door for both Real Madrid and Atlético Madrid to reposition themselves in the fight for the Spanish top-flight title. In fact, the Catalans have completely surrendered their advantage, now sitting level on points with Atlético, and just a point clear of Real, with both sides boasting a game in hand. All of a Barcelona persuasion, in turn, will no doubt be interested to hear of a statistic, highlighting the records of their side under the watch of Xavi in 2023/24, and Hansi Flick this time round, surfacing online.

When all was said and done, however, the Blaugrana failed to even secure for themselves a share of the spoils. This came as a solitary strike on the part of Sergio González, netted inside the five-minute mark in proceedings, proved the game’s decisive moment. Though some way short of their best this evening, Barcelona did manage to carve out a number of presentable goalscoring opportunities over the course of the 90 minutes. One such chance came inside the closing quarter of an hour, upon Ferran Torres doing superbly to slip Jules Koundé in inside the visitors’ penalty area. The latter, however, with the goal at his mercy, somehow managed to drag his ensuing effort wide, summing up an evening’s work to forget for Koundé and his teammates: classy, 🦈.#LALIGAHighlights | @FCBarcelona_es pic.twitter.com/qX3TiPmb6C Conor Laird – GSFN @2023 - All Rights Reserved.

Barça conceded early and created a lot of chances to make a comeback, but were extremely wasteful in front of goal and lost their second in a row at home against a relegation candidate, and will also finish the weekend tied on points with Atlético Madrid at the top of the table ahead of their monster clash next week. FIRST HALF Barça made a horrible start, allowing Leganés to create a huge chance that resulted in a Iñaki Peña save to deny a clear opportunity for Munir El-Haddadi. But the ensuing corner was headed home by captain Sergio González, and the visitors found themselves in front less than five minutes into the action. The Blaugrana responsed well to going behind, dominating the game and creating some massive chances. But Leganés goalkeeper Marko Dmitrovic had a perfect first half, making three monster saves to deny Robert Lewandowski twice and Raphinha once and keep his team in front. The Catalans had many other really good moments that were stopped either by timely interventions by the visitors’ defense or poor decisions by the Barça attackers, and the likes of Lamine Yamal and Dani Olmo wasted great chances of their own with bad execution on fairly easy shots inside the box. It was hard to understand how Barça could be behind given their dominance, but they were still trailing as the halftime whistle was blown and needed to be a lot more efficient up front to find the winning goals in the second half. SECOND HALF Barça continued to dominate and pressure Leganés throughout the final period, creating real chances time after time. Jules Kounde missed two huge ones, Lewandowski missed another one himself, and Fermín López had a sure goal cleared off the line. The Blaugrana tried until the very end and had a free-kick in a perfect position at the death, but Raphinha’s effort went over the bar and the final whistle came to confirm Leganés’ unlikely victory. This was an extremely frustrating loss in a game Barça dominated and should have won easily, but their wastefulness in front of goal cost them three huge points at home against a relegation candidate. They are still top of the table, but they’re now equal on points with a red-hot Atlético Madrid team, and the two face off next weekend. It looks like inconsistency will be the theme of this Barça’s season, and we’ll need to get used to more games like this. It feels like Barça can beat anyone and lose to anyone, and that’s not the formula for a great team.

Barcelona are of course currently locked in La Liga action, in a meeting with lowly Leganés. Wide-man Lamine, for his part, was afforded a starting berth in the clash, from his customary berth on the right flank. At one point during the opening 45 minutes, however, it appeared as though the 17-year-old would be forced into a premature departure from proceedings. This came after Lamine pulled up with an ankle problem, which left him grounded and in evident distress.

As things stand, the Blaugrana find themselves trailing by a goal to nil, after Sergio González opened the scoring inside the five-minute mark. Barca’s performance, all told, has proven an underwhelming one, with a number of the club’s stars looking short of their brilliant best. Two such players to have been singled out for more widespread condemnation than any others, though, come in the form of Dani Olmo, and Robert Lewandowski. Midfielder Olmo, for his part, has looked entirely off the pace this evening, struggling to link play between those behind him, and Barcelona’s frontline. And veteran attacker Lewandowski has carried forth what has been a personal recent dip in form, wasteful in front of goal, and sloppy in his link-up play. With such shortcomings having cost their side dear to this point in proceedings on Sunday, the Barca faithful, in turn, have not been at all shy in making their frustrations with the duo clear.

Eric has for his part of course found game-time altogether difficult to come by in Catalunya’s capital over the course of recent weeks. Despite having fully recovered from a niggling groin injury, the former Manchester City man has been afforded just ten minutes on the pitch since early-October. As much comes amid an intense battle for places in both Barcelona’s backline, and at the base of Hansi Flick’s midfield. With Jonathan Tah’s signing being lined up for next season, too, Eric is therefore considered as increasingly surplus to requirements by those behind the scenes at the Camp Nou. And, if the latest word stemming from the media this weekend is anything to go by, then such a transfer could be forthcoming as soon as January. As per a report from Relevo: ‘Eric García is a possible immediate exit in January. I am told that the team most interested at the moment is Girona, a club with which Eric already played 31 times in the 2023/24 season.’ Conor Laird – GSFN @2023 - All Rights Reserved.

Sagoe Jr. made the bench against Birmingham City in Ainsworth’s first game, before dropping out of the squad for the next match against Blackpool. The winger returned to the bench and came on as a substitute for 13 minutes against Cambridge United last weekend, but he was back to being an unused sub against Wycombe Wanderers on Saturday. The one point in Sagoe Jr.’s favour is that Shrewsbury have not been doing well without him. With the exception of their ‘new manager bounce’ win over Birmingham, Shrewsbury have lost 2-1 to Blackpool, 4-1 away to Cambridge United (all five goals scored before Sagoe Jr.’s introduction), and 4-1 again to Wycombe. That last result was the most embarrassing, a limp defeat in front of their own supporters at the New Meadow ground to leave the team bottom of League One. The only consolation was that it was against the league leaders. Perhaps Ainsworth might look at other options to try and change Shrewsbury’s fortunes, including giving another chance to Sagoe Jr. on the wing. But if not, Arsenal need to be thinking about a January recall. Sagoe Jr. signed a season-long loan deal with Shrewsbury, but even before Ainsworth’s arrival he was struggling for games. Excluding the cup competitions, the 20-year-old has made just three starts in 18 league matches. He’s started all five games across the EFL Trophy, FA Cup, and League Cup, but the team have often used rotated lineups in those competitions. Shrewsbury are now out of all three competitions, so there will be no further cup minutes on offer to the loanee. With just 13 minutes of on-field League One action since the start of November, the benefits of this loan look increasingly limited. There are three games remaining for the team in 2024, starting with Wigan Athletic on Saturday, December 21st.",

In fairness, that’s more to do with the team’s poor performances as a whole, reflected by their position at the foot of the table ahead of this weekend’s round of matches. The one positive was that they were facing 19th-place Valencia, knowing that a win would at least lift them above their opposition. On this occasion, Hein was better protected by his defence, only having to make one save across the 90 minutes. That’s not to suggest the goalkeeper didn’t have work to do though. He made four high claims, the most of any match he’s played this season. The end result was a clean sheet and a 1-0 win, taking Real Valladolid up to 19th – at least for now. Valencia have two games in hand, so the two-point gap between the sides could quickly disappear. Even so, it’s a step in the right direction, and Valladolid are now just three points off escaping the relegation zone. On an individual level, Hein has made 17 appearances in La Liga, keeping four clean sheets. He also remains a regular starter for Estonia in international matches, playing six times in September, October, and November.",

Votes are cast by former winners of the trophy, with each voter casting three votes for their top-three players. Mbappe ultimately won with 56 points, but that only put him marginally ahead of Arsenal’s William Saliba on 51. “We have to be fair. [Saliba] would have deserved it too,” Mbappe admitted afterwards. We know the identity of at least one of the voters for Saliba, with Karim Benzema putting Eduardo Camavinga as his first choice, Bradley Barcola in second, and Saliba in third. Interestingly, the former Real Madrid man didn’t name the current Madrid number nine in his top-three. Saliba had an excellent 2023/24 campaign on an individual level, playing every minute in the Premier League for Arsenal as the Gunners narrowly missed out on the title. The centre-back’s form earned him a place in Didier Deschamps’ France side for Euro 2024, and once again he played every minute up to their semi-final defeat to Spain. He helped France keep four clean sheets in six games along the way. Ultimately, the voters just about opted for Mbappe, but Saliba’s name is evidently also a popular one in France.

The Nations League finals will determine where some of the teams involved end up, meaning some uncertainty about which opponents Arsenal’s internationals could face. The group stage matches will take place in 2025, between March and November, followed by play-off matches in 2026 for the 12 teams that finish as group runners-up (along with the four best-performing Nations League teams that didn’t finish first or second). Let’s have a look at the draw as it stands, and the potential opposition for the members of Mikel Arteta’s squad taking part. Arsenal should have at least one international in Group A, with the winner of the Nations League match between Italy and Germany in June determining which of the two is in the group. If Germany win, Kai Havertz should be involved. If Italy win, Riccardo Calafiori and possibly Jorginho should be involved. As it stands, Arsenal won’t have any internationals in this group. Arsenal will have Kieran Tierney in Group C with Scotland, and they may also have either Fabio Vieira or Nuno Tavares involved with Portugal, but only if Portugal lose to Denmark in their Nations League match. Arsenal will have Oleksandr Zinchenko in Group D with Ukraine, and William Saliba may join the group with France if they beat Croatia in the Nations League. Arsenal should have at least one player in Group E, but it’s not clear which one yet. The winner of Spain’s Nations League match against the Netherlands will be in the group, so either David Raya and Mikel Merino could be involved, or alternatively Jurrien Timber. If Portugal win against Denmark, this will be where Tavares and Vieira might end up. The loser of the Spain-Netherlands tie will end up here, along with Jakub Kiwior with Poland. As it stands, Arsenal won’t have any internationals in this group. This will be a busy group for Arsenal, with Martin Odegaard of Norway joining Karl Hein of Estonia and the loser of the Germany-Italy tie. Leandro Trossard should be involved in Group J with Belgium. England’s Bukayo Saka and Declan Rice will be in Group K, with Ben White also reportedly under consideration for a return to the national side, and an outside possibility that the likes of Raheem Sterling, Reiss Nelson, Ethan Nwaneri, and Myles Lewis-Skelly could feature. The loser of the France-Croatia tie will end up here, so Saliba could play in this group depending on that result.",

Renee Slegers spoke to the press post-match, the first two questions are from Arseblog News. On her overall thoughts on a game that felt like three games in one…
That is a funny wrap up! So many things happened in the game. Our press was fine in the first half, in that phase of the game we were fine, we were on it and switched on and did well. On the ball I didn’t recognise us. We are usually consistently good on the ball with our details, our passing and positioning. With the detail of the pass was not right and then you get into problematic situations and they compound and that’s when the game goes to a game Liverpool likes and a game we don’t want to play. I agree, there were so many things to the game but we get the three points. We are critical as a team, I spoke to the girls, we are critical of things we want to do better but we are very aware that the three points was most important today. On whether playing without Walti and Little has cost them some control in the last two games…
Kyra and Mariona have played there for two games, against Villa and Valarenga, we get the game we want and we dominate and then you get so much out of Kyra and Mariona with their qualities. Today, because we don’t get the details right, the game becomes scrappy and duelling and transitional. All players are different but Kim Little and Lia Walti are more conservative most of the time and Kyra and Mariona are more brave and go forward and all four are very important and we just have to put the puzzle together for what kind of qualities we need. At the same time, all four of those players can play all the roles we want them to because they are so versatile and have so many qualities if that answers your question a little. On winning the game off the back of a short turnaround after an away game in Oslo…
It is hard, we got so many signs during the weekend on the men’s and women’s side in different competitions of teams losing points. Somehow it was good we got those signs and we play a little later in the weekend so we can be very aware of it. We have been messaging that with the girls as well. It is hard because the WSL is a tough competition, every game is hard to win, especially when you play with a quick turnaround. Liverpool away is always going to be a hard game with the style of play, the travel and the context. Coming away from Norway and doing really well but it’s -8 on an artificial pitch and we fly back the same evening, coming back 2 or 3 in the morning. The girls have one day to recharge and then we return and prep for Liverpool. With the whole context I am very pleased with the three points today. On Russo scoring in five consecutive WSL games…
She is doing really, really well, she gets at the end of it but also does a lot of hard work in other phases of the game out and in possession. Very pleased with her, she works really hard but credit to the rest of the team for setting up situations where Alessia can get on the end of things and bring her to her strengths. We do it together as a team. On Matt Beard saying she should get the full-time job and the Arsenal fans singing her name…
I am happy for how the team is performing, we are winning other than the one draw against United. The fans mean the world because as a team we came from a difficult time and they kept on backing us. They have been an important part of where we are. I am very happy for the fans, I am happy for the team and happy to work with the club. Otherwise, there is only two days and then we play Bayern, I am still in the middle of everything, so we are not done yet. My mind is on Bayern. On enjoying weeks with short turnarounds and relishing them…
Definitely, we described the games in this block as different challenges. Norway was a challenge and this was a challenge in itself. I am very happy with how the team finds ways to win and finds ways to overcome those challenges, that has been positive. On whether Chelsea and City dropping points ahead of this game impacted preparation…
No it didn’t impact the preparation, not from a tactical perspective or how we schedule things or how we set things up. We saw Chelsea got the 1-1, I didn’t know the City result coming into the game, I knew the half-time score. There were signs we need to be on it, you see with these schedules with a lot of games and champions League so it is an easy slip to make. It was a signal that we need to be on it and that is what we, for the most part, over the 90 minutes achieved because we get the three points. On whether she has enjoyed the feel good factor at Arsenal…
It is all professional, from game to game there is so much work in the background we need to do. The most important is that the players enjoy what we are doing. The players put in a lot of work, on and off the pitch and that is what we wanted to achieve with the team. On being at Arsenal…
I played for Arsenal academy when I was 17 and Arsenal has always been very special to me. I went to the training ground I got to meet Vic (Akers) and Robin van Persie and it was the first big club I visited, it is a special club and I am very proud to work for Arsenal. I was very proud in my other role, I am just happy I can contribute to the club and be part of it and work with these top players because it is really top players we have the privilege to work with. 14.van Domselaar; 2.Fox, 6.Williamson(c), 7.Catley, 11.McCabe; 32.Cooney-Cross; 8.Mariona (3.Wubben-Moy 90+2) 9.Mead (25.Blackstenius ‘58), 12.L.Maanum (10.Little ‘57), 19.Foord (17.Hurtig ‘76); 23.Russo Unused: 1.Zinsberger, 5.L.Codina, 16.Kafaji, 22.Kuhl, 26.Wienroither.",

Fans then identified the pictured player as Wolves teenager Lennon Patterson, who operates as a left-back or left-wing-back. It wouldn’t be a surprise if Patterson was on a trial with Arsenal, with the 17-year-old already having played for Brighton on another trial in October. It seems he’s set for a move away from Wolves, and it’s just a matter of finding the right club. Before his trial appearance for Brighton, Patterson had made around 30 appearances for Wolves’ u18s, dating back to his debut at that level in April 2022. But the defender is still waiting for his first chance with the Wolves u21s two -and-a-half years later, which is perhaps part of the reason why he’s now looking to move on. The fact Patterson is involved with the Arsenal first team is a positive sign for him, rather than simply holding a trial with the Gunners’ u18s or u21 sides. Though it would be difficult to train with the u18s right now, as they’re on their winter break. It’s not unusual for youth players to hold trials at multiple clubs before making a decision on their future, so there are no guarantees Arsenal become Patterson’s next club. But Brayden Clarke made the same switch from Wolves earlier this year, so it wouldn’t be the first time.  Either way, the chance to train with Mikel Arteta’s squad will be invaluable to him.",

Substitutes: Zinsberger, Wubben-Moy, Codina, Wienroither, Kühl, Little, Kafaji, Hurtig, Blackstenius Alessia Russo’s 20th minute goal was enough, as Arsenal beat Liverpool 1-0 in the final WSL game of the calendar year. The result keeps Arsenal in third, a point behind Manchester City in second, and seven points behind Chelsea. Having rotated midweek, Renée Slegers named the same starting eleven that dispatched Aston Villa last weekend, while Kim Little returned to the bench. First Half Liverpool wanted a penalty after Gemma Bonner ran into Katie McCabe and her own teammate after a Liverpool set piece, but the referee was correctly unmoved. On 12 minutes Liverpool had the first chance of the game. McCabe, with two Liverpool players around her, got a head to Taylor Hinds’ cross but the ball bounced to Smith, who shot over. Arsenal had taken some time to get going, but on 18 minutes Cooney-Cross set up Maanum, who almost played a one-two with Russo to create a tap-in, with only the intervention of Grace Fisk preventing Arsenal taking the lead. 2 minutes later, though, Arsenal would take the lead. McCabe’s corner was low and skipped past Foord and Tegan Micah. Bonner, on the line, desperately tried to clear, but her clearance went straight to Russo, who slammed the ball into the net. 0-1. Cooney-Cross’ crossfield switch allowed McCabe to play forward to Mead, who drove forward on the left, but her cross was cut out. On 26 minutes, Russo won a penalty. Foord’s cross found Russo, who controlled the ball, an was then tripped by Bonner. Mariona stepped to the spot but hit the post, having sent Micah the wrong way. Hinds won the ball high up the pitch, and shot from distance, but it was an easy save for Van Domselaar. Foord was quite productive on the right on Thursday, and she was being found in space on the right again with some frequency. She set up a chance for Maanum on 35 minutes, but the shot was wide of the near post. Holland beat Williamson and dug out a cross. Bizarrely, McCabe jumped highest like she was trying to score, and nearly headed into her own goal, but luckily, the ball bounced off the post and into Van Domselaar’s arms. Second Half Arsenal should’ve doubled the lead in the 50th minute. Mead and McCabe combined on the left to play in Russo, but she was tackled. The loose ball came to Mead, who took a shot that deflected off of Holland onto the post. Russo collected the rebound and set up Maanum in the middle, who skied her shot. Arsenal made a double switch on 58 minutes. Kim Little replaced Frida Maanum, while Stina Blackstenius replaced Beth Mead. From a corner, Foord headed across from the backpost, but her header hit the back of Catley’s head. Zara Shaw then handled the ball in the melee, but the referee didn’t see it and play continued. Van Domselaar then kicked the ball straight at Olivia Smith, but was able to grab it before Smith could react. On 75 minutes, McCabe took another low corner. She regained possession from the clearance, beat her defender and drove across the byline before shooting at Micah, who parried behind. From the corner, McCabe’s delivery was deeper, Micah didn’t come, and Williamson headed over from close range. In between the two corners, Lina Hurtig replaced Caitlin Foord, with Alessia Russo moving to the right and Mariona continuing through the middle. From another corner, Little picked up the clearance at the top of the box. She worked the ball onto her left and shot, with her shot deflected behind for another corner. Cooney-Cross’ delivery was deep, and from the back post Hurtig headed over. Mariona was booked in the 82nd minute for dragging down Smith in midfield after she’d lost the ball to the Canadian. Daniels glanced a header wide as the match entered 5 minutes of stoppage time. In the second minute of stoppage time, Lotte Wubben-Moy came on for Mariona, with Arsenal moving to a back 5. Blackstenius linked play well and found Russo, who fired a hopeful shot from distance that Micah easily saved. Liverpool looked to build one final attack, but McCabe won the ball back for Arsenal, carried it down the left, and that was enough to seal the game as the referee blew for full time.",

But when pushed on which of the two teams were the club of his heart, Henry gave a diplomatic but emphatic answer. “Monaco gave me an opportunity…to become what I became,” Henry began. “And then obviously they gave me an opportunity as a coach. So I have mad respect for Monaco and that’s always going to be the case. “But Arsenal is where my heart is. And that will never change.” Henry was then asked whether Monaco or Barcelona would be his “number two” team, and he answered: “Number two? Arsenal. Three? Arsenal. “In Spain, [it’s] Barcelona. Monaco will always be my team in France. But Arsenal is Arsenal.” Henry spent five years with Monaco as a senior player and three with Barcelona, but he racked up eight with the Gunners in north London, matching the other two combined and becoming Arsenal’s record goalscorer. Perhaps it’s no surprise that’s where he feels the strongest connection. Henry will have been pleased to see Arsenal coming out as 3-0 winners on the night, with Bukayo Saka scoring twice and assisting another goal. The Frenchman has previously suggested that Saka is his favourite player, saying: “I have a soft spot for him, he’s my favourite player. He’s been there for a long time. He is so nice. “The evolution of his game is just outstanding because he used to be lively, [then] difficult to defend against, to assists, to goals, to now goals and assists, taking pens…” All in all, Wednesday night must have been a pretty enjoyable one for Henry.",

It was one of two wins for the side against the same opponents in a week, having also knocked Napoli out of the Coppa Italia with a 3-1 victory. Arsenal will hope to pull off a pair of similar results against Crystal Palace this week. Tavares then made another appearance from the bench against Ajax in the Europa League, helping Lazio to a 3-1 win. It’s good to see Tavares back in action after his injury issues, particularly for a team performing so well. Lazio are fifth in Serie A, but they have a game in hand on the top two, and they’re just six points off the league’s summit. A win against Inter Milan on Monday would see Lazio overtaking their opponents and closing that gap to league leaders Atalanta. On top of that, Lazio are top of the Europa League table with 16 points from six games, and as mentioned they’re also progressing in the Coppa Italia. Tavares has a very realistic shot at silverware if things continue in the same vein. Tavares has been a big part of Lazio’s positive form, providing eight assists in 12 games so far. The player’s loan deal includes an obligation to buy for €9m (£7.6m) assuming the player meets certain clauses in his contract – most likely appearance clauses. The player will be on a deal until June 2029 if he signs, and the contract also has a sell-on clause reportedly worth more than 25% of a future fee.",

The assumption was that all five changes were attempts to get the Gunners over the line to score a winner and take all three points, but Arteta admitted afterwards that he had no choice in Declan Rice’s case. “Well, with Declan, I had to take him out because he was feeling something,” Arteta explained. “He has been with a little niggle for the last week or so. He has to be subbed in that moment. We have to do it.” Fortunately, Arteta also confirmed that Martin Odegaard’s substitution wasn’t due to injury, and he attempted to defend the decision to take off the team captain. “With Martin it was a tactical decision to try to change their rhythm, especially on that side,” Arteta said. “If Ethan comes in and scores a goal, is he a great sub? If he doesn’t, you have taken your captain out. That‘s football.  “[Odegaard’s reaction] was the same reaction as Martinelli, anybody. I’m sure that they want to continue to play the 90 minutes. But that’s why we have the subs. To try to help the team.” Rice joins Oleksandr Zinchenko and Riccardo Calafiori on Arsenal’s list of injury doubts for the next game, with Ben White and Takehiro Tomiyasu also certainly out of that match. Arsenal will face Crystal Palace in the League Cup on Wednesday, a competition Arteta often rotates in anyway. The manager may opt not to risk Rice in the competition to allow him to recover fully. Our first clue will be whether Rice is involved in training with the team over the next couple of days.",

Arteta praised his team’s defensive resilience and overall effort, noting that their work rate was “unbelievable,” but admitted that a lack of composure in critical moments cost them the result.  “We did everything that was necessary overall apart from the fact that we didn’t score a goal,” Arteta said. “We conceded absolutely nothing, dominated all the direct play, didn’t allow them to run, and conceded no set pieces.” The Arsenal boss highlighted the team’s pressing and defensive tracking as standout aspects of their performance. “When we have to track back 70 metres, we are the best in the world by far,” he said. “The way they want it, unbelievable.  “The way they try. Every single player is playing with a purpose to make things happen.” However, he acknowledged the bitter disappointment of leaving without a reward for their efforts: “You want to come away winning after what you’ve done on the pitch.” The match saw Arsenal dominate possession but fail to break down Everton’s resolute defence. Martin Ødegaard and Bukayo Saka were at the heart of Arsenal’s attacking play, but Jordan Pickford produced several excellent saves to deny the Gunners.  Gabriel Magalhães, returning from injury, impressed defensively, particularly with an early block to thwart Abdoulaye Doucouré. Despite their superiority, Arsenal’s attack lacked their usual sharpness and intensity, especially in the final third. Arteta made bold substitutions in the second half, including bringing on 17-year-old Ethan Nwaneri for Ødegaard, but the changes did little to alter the course of the match. Everton’s disciplined defensive shape frustrated Arsenal, who struggled to find space near the penalty area. The result leaves Arsenal in third place on 30 points, six behind Premier League leaders Liverpool and one behind Chelsea, who have a game in hand.  While Everton, sitting 15th, will be buoyed by their defensive resilience, Arsenal must grapple with another missed opportunity in their pursuit of the title. For Arteta, the focus remains on building from the positive elements of the performance. “The frustrating part is that they are there. We are trying everything and not getting the points. We have to continue.”",

An England U17 international who is highly rated by the club, Julienne seems perfectly suited to how Arsenal want to play as he is usually deployed as an inverted right-back. The 16-year-old has also played in midfield at times and has excellent close control, while he is always looking to move the ball forwards. As he demonstrated during the win against Monaco in the UEFA Youth League this week, Julienne is capable of pushing forwards to excellent effect when he is deployed at right-back. Julienne also made his debut at U21 level earlier this season as a substitute in the defeat to Tottenham Hotspur, while he has also featured for the U18s in the FA Youth Cup. The aim for Julienne in the second half of the campaign will be to become increasingly involved with the U21s and provide an indication of his ability at that level. Julienne is certainly an exciting player to watch and Arsenal will be looking to ensure that they manage his development as well as possible to eventually give him a chance of challenging for a place in the first-team squad. — Jeorge Bird is the author of www.arsenalyouth.wordpress.com Follow him on Twitter @jeorgebird  Δ  Δ Theo, Theo….

Playing just three days after a midweek Champions League game against a side who have had 10 days of rest, it wouldn’t have been a big surprise if we were a bit flat. And we were, but in comparison to what followed after the break, it was almost night and day. Reflecting on our opportunities to score, it was the ones early on that leave me with regret this morning. After Everton had what was possibly their only shot of the game in the 7th minute, we started to really dominate. Good work from Myles Lewis-Skelly and a nice ball into the box from Mikel Merino provided Martin Odegaard with a good chance, but he skied the ball over the bar. Minutes later the captain showed nice quick feet to fashion a chance for himself from the edge of the box, but with Jordan Pickford rooted to the spot, he dragged the ball wide. Superb work from Saka around the half-hour mark provided yet another chance for Odegaard, perhaps one he should have done better with, but the Everton defender made a very good block and the ball squirted just over the bar. There were other moments here and there, it wasn’t scintillating by any means, but as a precursor to a second half where we’d play ‘warmed up’, it that makes sense, it’s a story we’ve seen before. The second period started well, a cross from Odegaard was headed down by Kai Havertz, and Saka’s volley was well saved by Pickford. That was just 2 minutes in, but unfortunately that’s about as good as it got. We struggled to break down a stubborn Everton side, and I think it’s clear now teams who do this to Arsenal have a great chance of frustrating us. I don’t think it’s unique to us, by the way, it’s a game-plan many teams use because it’s effective, but it feels like our Achilles heel now. We don’t have the tools to unlock sides when they do it well. Finding that balance between Arsenal being really poor yesterday (which we were) and Everton carrying out that game-plan well (which they did), is tricky, but for me at least, it’s much more the former than the latter. We found it impossible to up the pace and intensity of the game, only Saka provided any of that with some bursting runs and beating some men to give us a bit of drive. Beyond that, it was flat. The football equivalent of nursing your punctured car to the garage, listening to that horrible sound of flapping rubber all the way. I said in yesterday’s preview, I thought the bench might be important for us in this game, because that midweek v freshness dynamic would be at play. As it turned out, we needed it to be, but it really, really wasn’t. If anything, what Mikel Arteta did with his substitutions made us worse. The removals of both Rice and Odegaard just after the hour mark didn’t help. If he had to take Rice off because of injury, fair enough, but his ‘tactical’ decision to put Ethan Nwaneri on for the Norwegian was a bad move. I don’t think Odegaard was at his best yesterday, but he was combining with Saka and we were worse when he went off. Arteta doesn’t make too many tactical missteps, but this was one. Nwaneri struggled to get into the game, just 10 touches of the ball in 30 minutes or so, and most of them seemed to come straight away before he faded completely. I don’t think his positioning was quite right, but that was something the manager could have addressed from the sideline quite easily. I’m as enthused about him as anyone, but I don’t think Arteta made the right decision with that change. How about trying Odegaard and Nwaneri, and replace the more functional Merino – especially when you need a goal. When you’re at home, dominating territory and possession, do you need Jorginho and Thomas Partey to trade wall passes on the halfway line? Could we have sacrificed a defender, and shifted temporarily to a back three, to put another attacking player on? Gabriel Jesus came on, dropped way too deep then basically disappeared. Leandro Trossard was no improvement on Gabriel Martinelli who dropped another poor performance against a veteran full-back who he should have tested more. And once more, when we need a goal, there was no sign of Raheem Sterling. Games like this are not uncommon, when you’re a ‘top team’ you have to find a way to win somehow, but if you have a player who is basically unusable on your bench, then you make your life so much harder. Much like the Fulham game last week, this performance collectively and some of the individual displays, make it so clear that January is now vital for this team. Yes, we could have made more of some early chances, but to huff and puff our way through that second half without really turning the screw on Everton was so disappointing. This isn’t an unfamiliar scenario, and how often have we seen it where in the final 15-20 minutes you build real attacking momentum and everyone asks ‘Why didn’t you play like that from the start?!’ We couldn’t even do that yesterday, and I don’t think it was lack of effort or application, but a lack of something ‘extra’ that this team badly needs. If you want to call it individualism or something else, there’s room for something different, and what we’re seeing the absolute need for at least one addition to the forward line as soon as we can possibly do it. Even with all the caveats about January being a difficult market etc, it can be done if the will and resources are there – and the lack of output from too many of our attacking options should be ringing alarm bells internally. We get zero from Sterling. Jesus now has 1 goal in his last 33 games for the club. Trossard and Martinelli are having a crap-off right now. Havertz is a player I like but will never be super-prolific, and only Saka has the kind of numbers you need from a player who can help drive you to a title. But you need those numbers from at least one more, and we don’t have that guy who perhaps, could be the difference on a day like yesterday. I saw Josh Kroenke was at the game yesterday, hopefully it’s as obvious to him as everyone else, because there’s only so much time you can hope a player comes good. At some point you have to make the call on them. We have at least two, possibly, three, for whom the bells should toll. Afterwards, Arteta said: I’m very disappointed because when you do what we’ve done today against them, you have to win the game, you know. But at the end, this is football, it’s the hardest thing. Those last 20- 25 meters to do what we have to do. Credit to them as well, how they block shots, Jordan Pickford for the saves that he’s made, the way they defend, the desire that they defend with. But honestly, it’s difficult to ask something else to the team. Individually, can we do things a little bit better and deliver more quality and deliver the magic moment? In that case that is necessary, yes, but that’s something that is not easy. I agree, it’s not easy, but if you continue to try and hammer a nail with a foam hammer, then that’s gonna make it even more difficult. There’s some serious thinking needed about this squad now, the summer window hasn’t done enough to improve us (or even maintain the level), and if we allow January to pass us by, there will be more days like yesterday which leave us frustrated and full of regret. Till tomorrow.",

 Mikel Arteta had to defend his decision to take off captain Martin Odegaard in Arsenal's goalless draw at Everton; Gunners remain six points behind leaders Liverpool, who fought back to draw 2-2 with Fulham despite a red card to Andrew Robertson Sunday 15 December 2024 09:01, UK Mikel Arteta defended his decision to substitute Martin Odegaard as Arsenal were held to a goalless draw by Everton and missed the chance to close the gap to leaders Liverpool. Arsenal captain Odegaard was withdrawn along with Declan Rice after 62 minutes at the Emirates Stadium, with Ethan Nwaneri and Jorginho introduced in their places. But while Rice's substitution was put down to a niggling injury, Arteta confirmed afterwards that the decision to take off Odegaard was down to ""tactical reasons"" and not fitness-related. The Gunners struggled to create chances without the Norway international during the closing stages as they failed to capitalise on Liverpool's 2-2 draw with Fulham at Anfield. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""With Declan, I had to take him out because he was feeling something,"" said Arteta. ""And with Martin it was a tactical decision to try to change their rhythm, especially on that side. ""If Ethan comes in and scores a goal, is he a great sub? If he doesn't, you have taken your captain out. That's football. ""[His reaction] was the same reaction as [Gabriel] Martinelli, as anybody. I'm sure that they want to continue to play the 90 minutes. But that's why we have the subs. To try to help the team.""

             Odegaard had not been at his best during the game, spurning a couple of presentable opportunities in the first half and not creating any chances as Arsenal failed to make their dominance count for the second consecutive league game following their 1-1 draw with Fulham. But it was still surprising to see him taken off, given his importance, and the changes did not have the desired impact for Arteta, with Arsenal unable to create any clear scoring opportunities in the closing stages as the Jordan Pickford-inspired visitors held out for a hard-earned point. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""I feel very disappointed not to win the game, because obviously there is only one team which deserves to win, which is Arsenal,"" added Arteta. ""We gave nothing away, no shots conceded, dominated the direct play, didn't allow them to run, no set-pieces, our high-press was excellent. ""We generated the chances, but in the last 20 metres the goals were missing the goals, which is what you have to do with all the dominance. But I cannot ask much more of the boys, apart from putting the ball in the net."" Meanwhile at Anfield, Liverpool fought back to claim a 2-2 draw, thanks to Diogo Jota's late equaliser, after Andrew Robertson was sent off for a last-man foul in the 17th minute. Arne Slot was delighted by his side's character as they preserved their six-point lead on Arsenal and said Robertson was punished for playing on with an injury. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""The character the team showed, that is what Robbo showed,"" said Slot. ""If you get a kick like this, two studs on a knee, that can hurt for a few minutes. If you keep running and it gets better and better, that is what we were hoping for. ""I only had one defender on the bench, who is not a left full-back, so you are hoping he was managing to come through it and did quite well. ""But the moment I noticed he wasn't completely himself was the one time they put the ball in behind and he started running and was just able to head back to Ali (Alisson Becker). ""I felt 'Hmm, OK, let's see how this continues' and I think it was quite soon afterwards he conceded the red card. ""Nothing to blame him, the character showed in wanting to continue because he got quite a hard knock with two studs. Unfortunately, it led to a deserved red card."" Slot praised his players, who stretched their lead at the top of the Premier League to five points, with second-placed Chelsea playing Brentford on Sunday. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""I think it is exactly the opposite from Girona (the midweek Champions League win) where I was pleased but not the performance,"" he added. ""Here I am very happy about the performance, I couldn't have asked for more, but of course not with the result because if you drop points in a home game against Fulham that is definitely not what you expect and what you want. ""But yeah, being a goal down twice, it's all going against you, except for one thing, which is our players and our fans, I thought we were outstanding.""

Putting the Bavarians under pressure made the win all the more pleasing, Rolfes indicated without mentioning the Bavarians by name. ""I have seen the results. What matters is the result here,"" he said. “Last year we didn't pay too much attention to what the others were doing. What we're working towards is showing our strength every three days. That puts pressure on the other clubs, in whatever form. Then they might drop points.” Eintracht Frankfurt can move back into second place, a point clear of Bayer Leverkusen and three behind Bayern, if they beat RB Leipzig on Sunday.",

Here is what we learnt: For much of this season, it looked like Bayern Munich were going to be handed the Bundesliga title as the teams below them would trip over one another, however, the tide now seems to be turning.  Today, Bayern lost their first game in the league this season as they succumbed to a 2-1 loss to Mainz in what was one of their worst performances of the season, but this time Jamal Musiala was unable to rescue them. At the Mewa Arena, Bayern dominated the ball but were unable to force a save from Robin Zentner for much of the game. Luck was also against them for once this season as Mainz’s first goal came from the ball being deflected and kindly dropped to Jae-Sung Lee to open the scoring, the Korean would then make it 2-0 on the hour mark. Bayern would give themselves hope when Leroy Sané scored in a wide-open goal in the 87th minute to make it 2-1. While Bayern were losing, Bayer Leverkusen continued their great form as a 2-0 win away at Augsburg means they are on a seven-game winning run but most importantly the gap between them and Bayern is now only four points. Despite being defending champions, Leverkusen would much prefer to be the chaser than the chased as pressure will begin to build on Bayern now as the honeymoon period under Vincent Kompany comes to an end.  To add to this, Bayern’s final game before the winter break is against RB Leipzig. Who have proven to be an issue for Bayern over the past couple of years, even if they are not at their best.  A year ago, Mainz were 17th in the Bundesliga table and looked destined for relegation. Later in the season, Bo Henriksen would then take charge and since then, Mainz have been on an upward trajectory. Twice they have beaten Borussia Dortmund and now they have also beaten Bayern Munich and each time they have deserved their wins.  On top of this, the academy remains at the heart of what Mainz are achieving last season it was Brajan Gruda, this season it is Jonathan Burkardt (who was substituted off in the first half) and Paul Nebel. Then surrounding the pair there are players who don’t get enough praise in Jae-Sung Lee and Nadiem Amiri as well as young talent in Armindo Sieb (who is on loan from Bayern). Now, Mainz sit 6th in the league after winning four of their last five games. The last time they were in this position was nine years ago.  Kiel lost 4-1 to Gladbach, while Bochum played out a bizarre draw with Union, but the pair are now five and eight points off of the relegation playoff places and both seem like they are heading towards the 2.Bundesliga.  The pair seem to lack any quality to be able to turn their situations around. Kiel did not cause any real issue for Gladbach today, while Bochum went down to 10 men very early on in Köpenick but managed to hold on for a point. The ending of this game was also delayed as an object was thrown at Bochum keeper Patrick Drewes, which the Bochum players reacted by returning to the dressing room. After a lengthy delay, Bochum came back out, without Drewes and Philipp Hofmann playing in goal, but neither team made any effort to score. The battle for the relegation playoff also currently looks like it is down to three teams with Heidenheim, St Pauli and Hoffenheim currently battling it out.

The first chance of the afternoon fell the way of the hosts as Jonathan Burkardt dragged his shot across goal. At the other end, Michael Olise unfurled an effort that caught the outside of the post. The aforementioned Burkardt was unlucky to injure himself in the process and made way for Armindo Sieb midway through the half.  Bo Henriksen's men made it a battle around part and sucked the Bavarian giants into the dogfight. Chances were few and far between after that as Bayern struggled to find a foothold. Mainz surged into an unlikely lead 4 minutes before the interval with substitute Sieb playing a pivotal role. Kim Min-Jae failed to deal with a cross which fell to the 21-year-old who picked out Jae-Sung Lee who steered past Daniel Peretz. Bo Henriksen jumped for joy in the 61st-minute as Jae-Sung Lee bagged his brace. A beautifully constructed move started by Anthony Caci's back-heel freed space for Sieb to pick out the Korean again for 2-0. Bayern eventually pulled one back in the dying embers as Joshua Kimmich's pass ricocheted off Stefan Bell leaving Leroy Sané with a routine tap-in. It would prove scant consolation in the end as Mainz hung on for victory and Bo Henriksen jumped for joy at the final whistle. The reigning Bundesliga champions found a 14th-minute lead which sent them on the path to victory at the WWK-Arena as Granit Xhaka played a key creative role. The Swiss midfielder pinged a delightful pass into Frimpong's path who cut it back for Martin Terrier to convert. The Frenchman was somewhat fortuitous to see his strike deflect off Matsima and beyond Labrović.  Augsburg thought they levelled through Keven Schlotterbeck when he looped a header over Lukas Hradecky, however VAR intervention would scratch the goal out. Die Werkself would double their advantage as Florian Wirtz collected a Nathan Tella pass to drill home from a semi-acute angle.  Although Die Fuggerstädters enjoyed a share of possession after the break, Jess Thorup's men couldn't seem to find a path to goal. An extra boost for Leverkusen arrived as Xabi Alonso introduced the fit-again Patrik Schick. Having learned from previous narrow victories in recent weeks, Xabi Alonso's men adopted a cautious but controlled style of play to seal three vital points and cut the gap down to 4 points from leaders Bayern Munich. Gerardo Seoane's men romped to victory this afternoon as Tim Kleindienst put the Die Fohlen-elf into a lead in the first minute. Franck Honorat availed off the passive Kiel defence to deliver the cross. Gladbach doubled their advantage in the 26th-minute as Elvedi's long ball wasn't defended well. Robin Hack supplied the perfect chip over the stranded Timon Weiner.  Kiel halved the defecit with a wonder-goal from Armin Gigović from all of 24-yards on the half-hour. The Bosnian took on Joe Scally and left Moritz Nicolas with absolutely no chance as the ball sailed into the top right corner. However, the hosts restored their two-goal cushion with a corner before the break. Franck Honorat picked up his second assist of the afternoon as Alasane Plèa glanced his header inside the near post. Although Alexander Bernhardsson had a half-chance in the second period, Gladbach would eventually put the game to bed in the 79th-minute with a beautifully fluid move. Alasane Plèa and Rocco Reitz linked up to play a swift one-two. The Frenchman wrapped his right foot around the ball and beyond Weiner's fingertips to secure the spoils. An incident involving Union Berlin fans and VfL Bochum goalkeeper Patrick Drewes in injury time has called a halt to the action abruptly. Union Berlin players are back out on the pitch awaiting VfL. We will have a report to follow at full-time.",

While they may be in the bottom half of the table, Augsburg are closer to the European places than they are to the drop zone, with five points separating them from the top six, compared with the six-point gap between themselves and the bottom three. The Fuggerstädter have proven to be a tough team to beat in recent times, having lost one of their previous eight matches in all competitions. That sole victory took place in last month’s away clash against Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich. However, Augsburg quickly bounced back to claim a 1-0 win over Bochum, before they beat Karlsruhe on penalties to seal their spot in the DFB-Pokal quarter-finals.  Jess Thorup’s side then returned to league action with a hard-fought 2-2 draw in their away meeting with second-placed Eintracht Frankfurt. After picking up a useful point at Deutsche Bank Park, Augsburg will now return to the home comforts of the WWK Arena, where they are unbeaten in four league matches (W3, D1). The hosts are unable to call upon Masaya Okugawa, Mads Pedersen, Yusuf Kabadayi, Finn Dahmen, Fredrik Jensen and Reece Oxford. Leverkusen have put together a run of six consecutive victories since they were held to a 1-1 draw in their away meeting with Bochum. They kicked off that winning run with home victories over Heidenheim and Red Bull Salzburg in the league and Champions League respectively. Xabi Alonso’s side went on to record Bundesliga wins against Union Berlin and St. Pauli on either side of a narrow victory against ten-man Bayern Munich in the Pokal.  Their winning streak looked set to end in Tuesday’s Champions League home clash against Inter Milan until Nordi Mukiele netted a 90th-minute winner. That moved Leverkusen into fourth position with two games left to play in the league phase. After enjoying success in European action, die Werkself will now turn their focus back to their Bundesliga title defence. The third-placed side have work to do if they are to win back-to-back league titles, with seven points separating them from leaders Bayern. Die Werkself will fancy their chances of beating Augsburg, having won four of their previous six head-to-head away meetings, including a narrow 1-0 win on their most recent trip to the WWK Arena in January. Leverkusen will have to assess Patrik Schick’s fitness ahead of Saturday’s away trip. The visitors will definitely be without the services of Jonas Hofmann, Amine Adli and Victor Boniface.",

Speaking after the game, Bayer Leverkusen coach Xabi Alonso was full of praise for Mukiele, saying he feels the French defender is really starting to find his feet following his summer loan move from Paris Saint-Germain. “Everything takes time. Nordi is adapting better and better. He had an injury, but he can now give us a lot of quality that we've been missing in that area. He knows the Bundesliga, has competed in the Champions League and has done really well in the big games,” said Xabi Alonso at his press conference after the game. “The goal is the highlight, but there are a lot of good things behind the highlight, and we need to keep pushing him.” Mukiele will be pushing for another start when Leverkusen travel to Augsburg on Saturday.",

Inter Milan, who had kept five consecutive clean sheets in the conpetition prior to tonight, posed a teak tough opponent standing in their way. In the end, Leverkusen fought tooth and nail for three vital points as they remain comfortably on track to qualify directly to the last-eight of Europe's premier competition. In what was a lively but ultimately scoreless first-half, Bayer Leverkusen made a sharp start when Nathan Tella rattled the crossbar with a 3rd-minute volley. Former Gladbach goalkeeper Yann Sommer was kept on his toes as all three of Alejandro Grimaldo, Florian Wirtz and Granit Xhaka took aim from range at different stages. Aside from Mehdi Taremi's blocked shot, Inter Milan struggled to find a foothold in the final third. Plenty on show to satisfy Xabi Alonso at the break despite nothing to separate the teams.  The Italian visitors seemed content to sit in after the break and invite Leverkusen pressure. Some neat dribbling from Florian Wirtz opened up space for Jeremie Frimpong to pull the trigger, however the acute angle got the better of the marauding wing-back. After another long-range effort from Tah on this occasion, Inzaghi opted for a triple substitution. Çalhanoğlu, Frattesi, and Thuram all made way for Asllani, Barella and Lautaro Martinez up top.  Die Werkself continued to press forward in search of the breakthrough. A vital tackle from Stefan de Vrij kept the Inter Milan defence watertight as the game neared it's conclusion. It seemed inevitable that the Italian club would continue their remarkable clean sheet run in the Champions League until the Leverkusen pressure eventually told. Alejandro Grimaldo's low delivery met Terrier who unintentionally broke the ball for Nordi Mukiele to thrash home and send the BayArena into raptures. ",

Leverkusen naturally saw a lot more of the ball than the hosts and had the best chance of the opening 45. Early on, a cross was played into the Inter box which Nathan Tella hit on the volley only to then hit the crossbar. Apart from that, neither side was able to challenge Yann Sommer or Matej Kovar. The same could be said for the second half as well as Leverkusen dominated the ball but struggled to break down the Inter defence. However, Leverkusen’s patience paid off as in the 90th minute, in true Leverkusen style, Nordi Mukiele converted the shot after the ball bounced around in the box, not only to score his first game for Leverkusen but scored the first goal that Inter conceded in the league phase.  The positive from this game for Leverkusen is that they held firm and Inter’s attackers such as Marcus Thuram and Lautaro Martinez were non-existent for the whole game and they managed to hold the Italian champions to zero shots on target. With die Werkself having struggled defensively a lot this season, they will take big confidence in the defensive side of this performance. Away from the goal, on the attacking front, the lack of a true striker was prevalent. Sometimes in games like this, you want to lump the ball up to the striker and this will provide an alternative option, but Leverkusen did not have that and looked rather one-dimensional in their attacking build-up, which played into Inter’s hands for the majority of the game.  Overall, Leverkusen move into second in the league phase table, behind only Liverpool. They can now turn their attention on the Bundesliga as they look to end their highly successful year on a high and continue their chase down of Bayern Munich.  Matej Kovar (5), Nordi Mukiele (6), Edmond Tapsoba (5), Jonathan Tah (5), Piero Hincapié (5), Jeremie Frimpong (5), Exequiel Palacios (5), Granit Xhaka (5), Alejandro Grimaldo (5), Florian Wirtz (5), Nathan Tella (5) Others: Martin Terrier (-)  GGFN | Jack Meenan    @2023 - All Rights Reserved.

Jeremie Frimpong takes up a more attacking role alongside Florian Wirtz, while Nathan Tella continues to lead the line in the absence of injured strikers Schick and Boniface.  As for the visitors, they come into the game off the back of a routine 3-1 win at home to Parma last weekend. Head coach Simone Inzaghi has opted to start with a 3-5-2 formation including former Bundesliga stars like Yann Sommer in goal, midfielder Hakan Çalhanoğlu and Marcus Thuram up top.

Elsewhere, Leverkusen will be without Victor Boniface for the remainder of 2024 but after recovering from a calf injury, Patrik Schick is likely to be named on the bench.

At the time, the 19-year-old had other options, including Bayer Leverkusen - and the German champions remain interested, according to Sky Germany. With Güler's contract running until 2029, the only realistic option is a loan move.  A January move is not an option, as Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti recently stressed, but Leverkusen want to be ready should the opportunity to sign him arise in the future. With Florian Wirtz heavily linked with a move away from Leverkusen, Güler could be a potential replacement in the summer. Leverkusen are far from the only club monitoring the Turkish international, though, with Arsenal, Aston Villa, AC Milan and Juventus also mentioned as suitors.",

Currently Real Madrid and Bayern Munich are the favourites to sign the attacking midfielder.  B04 have been admirers of Güler even before his move from Fenerbahçe to Real Madrid. The feeling is that should Wirtz head to Madrid in the summer and Güler  wants to play regular football, he could move the other way and head to Leverkusen.  The 19-year-old’s contract runs until 2029 with Real and the club currently have no intentions of selling the Turkish international this winter.  However, whilst his relationship with head coach Carlo Ancelotti is very good, if the door opens this summer and Güler wants to play regularly at the top level, Leverkusen would be there.  B04 are already made contact with the player’s representatives and family but are yet to conduct formal talks with Real.  The move could possibly mirror that of Dani Carvajal (32) who took an intermediate step from Real to Bayer before going on to have a world-class career.  GGFN | Jamie Allen  @2023 - All Rights Reserved.

       Sunday 15 December 2024 16:00, UK Our football betting expert Jones Knows is back to provide more Premier League insight as he hunts down the value in the markets. When it looks like a draw, walks like a draw, quacks like a draw, then it's probably a draw. And it becomes an interesting betting angle when that outcome is priced up as the outsider of the three at 11/4 with Sky Bet. When it comes to draws these two teams are superb at them. Crystal Palace have drawn a Premier League-high seven games this season and Brighton have drawn six - the joint second-most games. Six of the last 10 meetings have also ended 1-1. Keep the draw on your side. The fallen-giant derby. Both teams are on their lowest points total after 15 Premier League games. This sharp decline of Manchester City is becoming a maddening thing to unpack with Pep Guardiola's insistence that City are playing well while acting uncharacteristically hapless in trying to fix it is certainly adding to the circus of it all.

             The defensive numbers behind City's results of seven defeats in 10 are extraordinary - a sackable offence for most managers. Since October 5, City are working at a per-game average of conceding 2.79 big chances on their goal - only Ipswich and Southampton have a worse return. Teams are charging past them in transition at will and their per-game average of being dribbled past figure of 10.36 is extraordinary - only West Ham have a higher average. Guardiola's side have conceded two or more goals in nine of their last 10 matches, meaning the 7/4 with Sky Bet on Manchester United following suit and scoring at least twice is the value call in a winnable game for Ruben Amorim if he gets his tactics right to expose City's laughable make-up out of possession. Why aren't Chelsea serious title contenders? It's a question I've been pondering as they've shortened dramatically into 6/1 with Sky Bet for the Premier League crown. The inconsistency factor is high on that reasoning. Teams that win titles win matches when not playing well. I'm not sure this young Chelsea side are there yet - there are going to be bumps in the road, especially with such an unreliable goalkeeper in Robert Sanchez between the sticks. That bump could be on the horizon here.

Brentford haven't lost to Chelsea in five matches, winning the last three at Stamford Bridge. Yes, Thomas Frank's football isn't quite as savage on the road but they will hold no fear and Chelsea look a risky prospect at 1/3 with Sky Bet for the win, especially at an odd kick-off time. Brentford double chance at 9/4 it is then. Tyler Dibling is going to win Southampton a game on his own soon - he's that good. And in truth, Russell Martin probably needs him to as the Saints carry little attacking threat, bar the exciting vibes that Dibling brings. This might be the night where Dibling delivers a big one. Defences don't come as generous as Tottenham's without Micky van de Ven - he is so instrumental to Ange Postecoglou's style of football and his weak hamstrings will probably be the big Aussie's downfall as Spurs look flat, timid and a shell of their best at the moment. Dibling to score in a home win at 9/1 with Sky Bet stands out. Andoni Iraola's unique and hard-to-stop football is surely going to land him a top job soon enough - if a vacancy were to come up at Tottenham for example, Iraola should be their number one priority. In the last 44 games, Iraola has Bournemouth as the sixth-best team in the Premier League - that is an outrageous achievement for a club who were only promoted two seasons ago. Just look at how subsequent promoted teams have fared, it's no easy task. They are a better football team in every department than West Ham, who once again looked quite stodgy and lacking identity in their important win over Wolves. The home win is skinny enough at 7/10 with Sky Bet but adding under 4.5 goals into the mix gets us to a 5/4 shot that makes sense considering the Cherries have seen under that line in 10 of their last 12 home matches.

 In an exclusive interview with Sky Sports, Aston Villa's Tyrone Mings discusses his return from injury for an exciting season at home and abroad. Watch Nottingham Forest vs Aston Villa live on Sky Sports Premier League this Saturday from 5pm; kick-off 5.30pm 
          Comment and Analysis
              @ghostgoal
 Saturday 14 December 2024 13:34, UK Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  When Tyrone Mings suffered an anterior cruciate ligament injury in the opening game of last season, nobody needed to tell him that it would be a long road back. Unfortunately, the Aston Villa and England defender has experienced it before. It was not pretty. It was at Bournemouth, soon after becoming their club record signing, that Mings damaged his anterior and medial ligaments minutes into his Premier League debut. That was almost a decade ago now and it sent Mings spiralling into a dark place. He has since spoken of how he sought comfort in alcohol, was consumed by the feeling that he had lost everything, the thought of a life without a football threatening his whole identity. He has told the tale of how he broke down in tears in Eddie Howe's office. This time around, older and wiser, he was always going to approach the challenge very differently. ""It has been different. I would not say it has been easier. It is just that I have a little more perspective. I have kids now so that always helps,"" Mings tells Sky Sports. ""When I was at Bournemouth, it was a very uncertain time. I was still trying to make my way in the game and trying to prove to the fans that I would be a good signing. So the timing of it was really difficult to take. This time has been difficult for different reasons. ""I felt like I was playing well when I got injured. I felt like I was trying to establish myself in the manager's idea and the team were doing well. So it was a tough time to sit out and see other people build on all the work we had put in together over the previous years."" Mings has a routine now, one that includes speaking to his therapist regularly, keeping him in the right head space. The days when his extra-curricular activities were counter-productive are over. That energy has been successfully channelled in a positive way.

             ""Every waking minute was spent trying to figure out how I'm going to get my knee better,"" he stresses. But there is his involvement with the Tyrone Mings Academy in Bristol, helping to provide fun opportunities for children in the region. And new interests too. Through the PFA, he has taken a global football business management course. ""I have really learned about what it means to be a sporting director or a CEO so they will not be new things when I retire. I am certainly not scared of what comes after football."" Nor should he be. Mings has always been an articulate spokesman, whether explaining the reasons for players taking the knee in opposition to racism or countering the claims of then health secretary Matt Hancock that footballers needed to give back more. Now 31, he cuts a confident and measured figure. Success will come post-retirement. But there are still ambitions to fulfil on the pitch and he is fortunate that while he was out with injury, Villa continued to go from strength to strength under Unai Emery. The team he returns to is one not only competing in the Champions League but thriving in it, while continuing to claim their spot towards the top end of the Premier League table. As a result, the motivation for Mings is easy. New opportunities keep coming up. ""People are always looking for new ideas, new stimuli, so the Champions League has certainly given a different feeling around the club. You see it for the fans at Villa Park or at away games. It is certainly a different feeling and the players feel that as well. ""It did not really drive me through rehab as it felt so far away from where I was at the time. I still had a lot of hurdles to overcome to get back on the football pitch. But now I am here and part of it, it is a special time in the club's history and it adds something."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  For Mings, released by Southampton as a youngster, his mother writing to every club in the Football League in the hope of kickstarting his career only for him to progress the hard way via spells at Yate and Chippenham, it has been an amazing journey. Maybe that makes it that bit more special for him when the Champions League music plays. He has won 18 caps for England, featuring at Euro 2020, but Europe's premier club competition still represents another high, another marker on his route to the top. It is true of a number of Villa's senior players. Ollie Watkins came through Exeter City's academy, making his Premier League debut at 24. Emiliano Martinez was still playing for Reading at the age of 26. One wonders whether it is one of the secrets of their success. ""There are a few players with quite a lot of Champions League experience but it is new as a team, it is new as a group, it is new that we are doing it together. Quite a lot of the players also have bought into the journey that we have been on for so long now."" He talks of winning a trophy with Villa. ""Big on everybody's to-do list here."" And the feeling that they can ""achieve something special together"" - calling this as an ""exciting time"" and speaking of wanting to replicate Villa's glorious successes of the past. Last month, he made his Champions League debut. It was an inauspicious one, picking up the ball in error to concede the penalty from which Club Brugge scored the only goal of the game. Emery called it one of the worst errors that he has seen made in football. A serious injury on his Premier League debut. A serious error on his Champions League debut. Life keeps throwing things at him. ""If there is something that is going to happen, it is usually going to happen to me,"" he says, insisting that the error did not affect him. ""I do not participate in the extreme highs or extreme lows of the emotions in the game. I am fairly level-headed and I am fairly unflappable, I think, in terms of riding those emotions."" He then says something particularly revealing about the way he thinks now. ""I was not frustrated at what happened itself because mistakes happen. And I think if that was going to happen to anybody, I am happy that it happened to me because I am fairly sure I can cope with it. My next game after that was Brentford I think."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  He had to wait a month, being an unused substitute for the next four games. But when he made his Premier League return after 16 months out, he was named player of the match in a 3-1 home victory over Brentford that ended a run of eight without a win. ""The thing about the Bruges game is that I never came away from that game feeling any differently than what I did when I played against Brentford and got man on the match."" It is surely a product of the long hours of work put into shaping his own mentality. ""The guy I use has been paid a monthly retainer since 2015,"" he says of his therapist. ""It is less to do with football now, more just about my well-being and about life in general. One of the learnings of my career is to be very calm when things happen in football."" He adds: ""When the Bruges incident happened, some people did not even bother texting me because they knew I would be fine. I can promise that regardless of whether we win 3-0 or lose 3-0, I will be the same person when the next game comes around."" “I am still in the last 20 per cent of my rehab. Although when players come back from long-term knee injuries, the first game back everybody presumes that you are now back, there are certain things in rehab that you cannot replicate,” he explains.


“That is a lot to do with the speed of the game, the decision-making, positioning on the pitch, the repercussions of what happens if you do make that tackle or block that shot. Those are split-second decisions in-game. That is what the final 20 per cent of rehab is.


“You can get yourself as fit and as strong and as sharp as possible without games. But this part now that I am in, I think my performances have been good for how long I have been out and I am really enjoying the opportunities when they come.”
 Every team needs players like that. As for Villa, they are fifth in the Champions League table. One more win would surely take them to the last 16. Beat Nottingham Forest on Saturday and they will move above Man City into fourth spot in the Premier League too. ""The most impressive thing last season was balancing the European football to allow us to get Champions League this year. The big challenge again is: how do you balance Champions League games without it affecting your Premier League form? ""I think teams historically who have broken into the Champions League have struggled with that due to squad size and emotions and travelling so I think the fact that we have been able to rotate the squad and the manager is very calm as well has helped. ""There was a period where we had a few bad results and it felt like everything was going against us but it is time to be calm and see the bigger picture. I think we can be proud of where we sit right now, both in the Champions League and the Premier League."" Like the lows, Mings intends to take the highs in his stride. But he has come too far and worked too hard not to enjoy it. ""There is a good feeling here. Being back and part of it is just as impressive and wholesome before. I was loving it before and I am loving it now.""

The Reds are four points clear at the top of the table with a game in hand over their rivals following the postponement of the Merseyside derby.  Arne Slot’s side have the second best home record in the English top flight having taken 18 points from a possible 21. They have scored 13 goals at Anfield and conceded on just three occasions.   They host Fulham on Saturday afternoon.  The Cottagers have been one of the surprise packages in the Premier League this term. Marco Silva’s men are 10th in the Premier League, just two points behind fifth-placed Nottingham Forest and four behind fourth-placed Manchester City.  Fulham have won just one of their previous 14 matches against Liverpool across all competitions but do come into this match in good form. Their points haul of 23 is matched by their Expected Points total, pointing to the fact performances have matched results.  They have also done well against big sides this term. They’ve drawn games against Spurs and Arsenal and they picked up three points against an impressive Brighton side. The Cottagers lost 3-2 to reigning champions Manchester City but posted an Expected Goals total of 2.3 in that defeat. They deserved to win.  Silva possesses players who can cause teams trouble and Raúl Jiménez looks back to his best. And if Liverpool aren’t at their best, they weren’t in mid-week against Girona in the Champions League, an upset could be on the cards.  Ahead of the 2024/25 Premier League campaign, a lot of people tipped Aston Villa for another top four push after completing some good business during the summer transfer window. A lot of people, myself included, also thought Nottingham Forest would be involved in a relegation battle.  Yet here we are in December with Forest sat above Villa in the table. Nuno Espírito Santo’s side are in fifth while Unai Emery has his team sitting in sixth. They’re level on points but the narratives around both teams could not be any more different.  Forest are defying the odds. Villa are struggling to live up to expectations.   The Villans make the trip to the City Ground this weekend looking to make it three wins on the bounce in the Premier League after a difficult period. Across their last five games in the English top flight, they have picked up just seven points. Forest have tailed off a little too, claiming just six points during the same period. However, they did beat Manchester United at Old Trafford last time out and they have upped their game against the more traditional top sides, beating Liverpool and drawing with Chelsea.  It is worth noting that Forest’s home form hasn’t been great – they rank 12th with 11 points from 21 on offer – while Villa are decent enough on their travels, winning three from seven matches.  For both teams it is a big game in the grand scheme of things.  Both teams are in dire need of a reaction and a performance.  Few would’ve expected to be saying this about Manchester City in December but the reigning champions need a big showing against their neighbours. There’s more at stake than just three points and local pride.  City have won one of their last 10 across all competitions and fell to defeat again in midweek as Juventus claimed a 2-0 win in the Champions League. By the time kick off comes around, the reigning champions could be five points behind Arsenal and 11 points off of leaders Liverpool.  The champions are in freefall. A win here in the Manchester derby could be the catapult needed to get things going again. A loss could end their title hopes before the turn of the New Year. City have the quality but they’re lacking in confidence.  United need something. They need anything to really kickstart the Rúben Amorim era.  The 4-0 win over Everton was a false dawn. They lost 3-2 to Nottingham Forest at Old Trafford in their last game in the league and have suffered back-to-back losses in the Premier League under the Portuguese tactician. If results don’t go their way this weekend, they finish in 14th place.  The result here could be seismic in Manchester and across the Premier League.   Southampton welcome Spurs to St Mary’s Stadium on Sunday afternoon.  Both teams are in desperate need of three points.  The Saints are bottom of the Premier League and have just one win to their name in the English top-flight this term. They have conceded 31 goals and found the back of the net on just 11 occasions. Russell Martin’s job as manager is under threat with the one-time Swansea boss reluctant to switch things up in a bid to extend Southampton’s stint in the top tier.  His team are regularly playing into trouble and making life difficult for themselves.  The same can be said for Spurs under Ange Postecoglou.  Sky Sports pundit Jamie Carragher believes the Aussie tactician is too stubborn.  “I wake up every morning hoping the sun is shining, so I can put some shorts and a T-shirt on but if it’s raining, you put your coat on.” Spurs held a 2-0 lead over Chelsea last time out but imploded to lose 4-3. The result left them 11th in the Premier League and they lost Micky van de Ven and Cristian Romero to injuries. The pressure is mounting on the former Celtic boss and defeat here could spell the end for him.

The Reds are four points clear at the top of the table with a game in hand over their rivals following the postponement of the Merseyside derby.  Arne Slot’s side have the second best home record in the English top flight having taken 18 points from a possible 21. They have scored 13 goals at Anfield and conceded on just three occasions.   They host Fulham on Saturday afternoon.  The Cottagers have been one of the surprise packages in the Premier League this term. Marco Silva’s men are 10th in the Premier League, just two points behind fifth-placed Nottingham Forest and four behind fourth-placed Manchester City.  Fulham have won just one of their previous 14 matches against Liverpool across all competitions but do come into this match in good form. Their points haul of 23 is matched by their Expected Points total, pointing to the fact performances have matched results.  They have also done well against big sides this term. They’ve drawn games against Spurs and Arsenal and they picked up three points against an impressive Brighton side. The Cottagers lost 3-2 to reigning champions Manchester City but posted an Expected Goals total of 2.3 in that defeat. They deserved to win.  Silva possesses players who can cause teams trouble and Raúl Jiménez looks back to his best. And if Liverpool aren’t at their best, they weren’t in mid-week against Girona in the Champions League, an upset could be on the cards.  Ahead of the 2024/25 Premier League campaign, a lot of people tipped Aston Villa for another top four push after completing some good business during the summer transfer window. A lot of people, myself included, also thought Nottingham Forest would be involved in a relegation battle.  Yet here we are in December with Forest sat above Villa in the table. Nuno Espírito Santo’s side are in fifth while Unai Emery has his team sitting in sixth. They’re level on points but the narratives around both teams could not be any more different.  Forest are defying the odds. Villa are struggling to live up to expectations.   The Villans make the trip to the City Ground this weekend looking to make it three wins on the bounce in the Premier League after a difficult period. Across their last five games in the English top flight, they have picked up just seven points. Forest have tailed off a little too, claiming just six points during the same period. However, they did beat Manchester United at Old Trafford last time out and they have upped their game against the more traditional top sides, beating Liverpool and drawing with Chelsea.  It is worth noting that Forest’s home form hasn’t been great – they rank 12th with 11 points from 21 on offer – while Villa are decent enough on their travels, winning three from seven matches.  For both teams it is a big game in the grand scheme of things.  Both teams are in dire need of a reaction and a performance.  Few would’ve expected to be saying this about Manchester City in December but the reigning champions need a big showing against their neighbours. There’s more at stake than just three points and local pride.  City have won one of their last 10 across all competitions and fell to defeat again in midweek as Juventus claimed a 2-0 win in the Champions League. By the time kick off comes around, the reigning champions could be five points behind Arsenal and 11 points off of leaders Liverpool.  The champions are in freefall. A win here in the Manchester derby could be the catapult needed to get things going again. A loss could end their title hopes before the turn of the New Year. City have the quality but they’re lacking in confidence.  United need something. They need anything to really kickstart the Rúben Amorim era.  The 4-0 win over Everton was a false dawn. They lost 3-2 to Nottingham Forest at Old Trafford in their last game in the league and have suffered back-to-back losses in the Premier League under the Portuguese tactician. If results don’t go their way this weekend, they finish in 14th place.  The result here could be seismic in Manchester and across the Premier League.   Southampton welcome Spurs to St Mary’s Stadium on Sunday afternoon.  Both teams are in desperate need of three points.  The Saints are bottom of the Premier League and have just one win to their name in the English top-flight this term. They have conceded 31 goals and found the back of the net on just 11 occasions. Russell Martin’s job as manager is under threat with the one-time Swansea boss reluctant to switch things up in a bid to extend Southampton’s stint in the top tier.  His team are regularly playing into trouble and making life difficult for themselves.  The same can be said for Spurs under Ange Postecoglou.  Sky Sports pundit Jamie Carragher believes the Aussie tactician is too stubborn.  “I wake up every morning hoping the sun is shining, so I can put some shorts and a T-shirt on but if it’s raining, you put your coat on.” Spurs held a 2-0 lead over Chelsea last time out but imploded to lose 4-3. The result left them 11th in the Premier League and they lost Micky van de Ven and Cristian Romero to injuries. The pressure is mounting on the former Celtic boss and defeat here could spell the end for him. Likewise, though, a heavy loss for Southampton could spell the end for Martin.  The stakes are high.    (Cover image from IMAGO)   You can follow every game from the Premier League on FotMob – with in-depth stat coverage including xG, shot maps, and player ratings. Download the free app here.  © Copyright 2024 FotMob",

There’s nothing but goal difference to separate the teams ahead of the kick-off, with both trailing table-topping Atalanta by six points. Atalanta’s 1-0 triumph at Cagliari on Saturday has ramped up the pressure on Lazio and Inter to get into the win column. Marco Baroni’s men have frequently been there this season. A 3-1 win at Ajax in the UEFA Europa League last midweek solidified their momentum after beating Napoli in a mouth-watering doubleheader.  Last weekend’s 1-0 victory at Stadio Diego Maradona reignited Lazio’s spirits following a disappointing 3-1 defeat at newcomers Parma. Gustav Isaksen’s late winner on a rainy night in Naples restored confidence around the Biancocelesti camp amid hot pursuit of only a third Serie A title in the club’s history.  Inter will be out to hinder Lazio’s chances of returning to the throne for the first time since 1999/20, seeking redemption for a heart-wrenching defeat at Bayer Leverkusen last Tuesday. Nordi Mukiele’s 90th-minute goal denied the Nerazzurri a piece of UEFA Champions League history, knocking them down from a five-game unbeaten start (W4, D1). Simone Inzaghi’s men were minutes away from becoming the first Champions League team to go the first six matches of a new campaign without conceding. It was also Inter’s first scoring blank on the road in five games (W4, L1), heightening the pressure on Lautaro Martinez and his teammates to get a result in Rome. Lazio Despite four defeats across the opening 15 matchdays, Lazio head into proceedings as one of only three sides to have hit double digits in terms of league victories (W10, D1). Most of their good work has come on this ground, where Baroni’s charges boast a near-flawless top-flight record this season (W6, D1). As one of only four Serie A sides yet to lose a home match in 2024/25, Lazio stand out as one of the most formidable hosts in European football (W8, D2). Delivering action from the get-go, they have opened the scoring in seven of those eight wins, highlighting the potential for a quick-fire start.  Given the strength of their opposition, nothing less would do on Monday. However, Lazio won’t shy away from the challenge. They may have slumped to a 2-0 defeat in this corresponding fixture last term, but they had enjoyed a prolific home run against Inter beforehand.  Indeed, three victories from four previous duels at this venue (D1) perfectly encapsulate their ability to rise to the occasion in high-stakes encounters. Inter Inter had to swallow a bitter pill in Germany last week, relinquishing a remarkable 13-game unbeaten streak in all competitions (W11, D2). But it was nothing less than Leverkusen deserved, considering they had the Nerazzurri on the ropes all game.  Whether it was fatigue or Inzaghi’s tactical choice, Inter didn’t look like a team capable of weathering the storm against a high-intensity opponent. However, equipped with confidence from their recent domestic triumphs, the visitors return to Serie A action, searching for a tenth consecutive unbeaten league outing (W7, D2). They’ve been particularly outstanding on the road. Along with Juventus, they’re the only Serie A side yet to lose an away league game this season (W4, D2). It’s also worth noting that they’ve won on their last four top-flight travels, including a 1-0 triumph at this stadium against Roma. That result initiated a run of three successive away league wins ‘to nil,’ bookended by an outrageous 5-0 rout of Hellas Verona in which they scored all goals before the break. In addition to long-term absentee Alessio Romagnoli, Lazio will be without their leading goalscorer, Taty Castellanos, for accumulated yellow cards. On the bright side, Luca Pellegrini and Patric have passed fit for this meeting after minor fitness problems forced them to withdraw in Amsterdam. As for Inter, Francesco Acerbi and Benjamin Pavard remain on the sidelines. It means ex-Lazio star Stefan de Vrij and 24-year-old Yann Bisseck will join forces with Alessandro Bastoni at the back. After commencing on the bench against Leverkusen, Nicolo Barella and Henrikh Mkhitaryan will likely regain their places in the midfield. Lazio (4-2-3-1): Provedel; Lazzari, Gila, Romagnoli, Tavares; Guendouzi, Rovella; Isaksen, Dia, Zaccagni; Noslin. Inter (3-5-2): Sommer; Bisseck, De Vrij, Bastoni; Dumfries, Barella, Calhanoglu, Mkhitaryan, Dimarco; Martinez, Thuram. Although Lazio are perfectly capable of causing an upset, it takes a brave man to bet against Inter. Both sides enter this round in fine form, but the visitors’ strength in depth gives them a cutting edge. Yet, even without Castellanos, the hosts have the tools to topple their former manager. Therefore, our recommendation is to kick back and enjoy the contest. It promises to be a memorable affair. Your email address will not be published.

During his recent interview with Telemundo Deportes via Calciomercato, Simeone highlighted Inter’s meteoric rise to the continent’s elite under Simone Inzaghi. Despite lacking a ‘classic‘ superstar, Inter boast a star-studded squad. Above all, Simeone appreciates the team’s chemistry, crediting Inzaghi for creating a perfect mix of seasoned veterans and up-and-coming talents.  “Today, which are the three best teams in the world? Barcelona, Inter, and Manchester City. I like Inter a lot; it’s a team without a star but with many important players,” the former Nerazzurri star said.  “The work of Simone Inzaghi has created the ability to compete in the best way possible with a practical and dynamic style of play. He has done very well in recent seasons, reaching the Champions League final and winning the Scudetto. They are a team, they are a team!“ Simeone’s statement isn’t far from the truth. Despite last midweek’s late heartbreak at Bayer Leverkusen, Inter have been a force to be reckoned with in the Champions League and Serie A under Inzaghi. They’re well-positioned to secure automatic knockout qualification at Europe’s top table and are firmly in the running for a second consecutive Scudetto.  Being praised by one of Europe’s most respected managers is the ultimate testament to the progress and consistency Inter have achieved under Inzaghi. They’ll resume their domestic title defense on Monday with a high-profile away fixture against Lazio. Your email address will not be published.

Speaking to the press in the build-up to Saturday’s Premier League clash against Fulham via Calciomercato, the Dutchman confirmed the former Juventus winger lacks regular first-team action. Chiesa left Turin to join Liverpool in a £10 million deal in the summer after being deemed surplus to requirements by new Juventus manager Thiago Motta. However, he has only collected 78 minutes on Merseyside this season across three cameo appearances.  Low in the pecking order, Chiesa could soon request a transfer, with several Serie A clubs vying for his signature. In addition to long-term admirers Inter, Milan and Roma are keen on bringing the unsettled Reds star back to his homeland.  “What he needs is to play, the problem is that if he hasn’t played for five or six months, sometimes it’s difficult for a coach to give him his first minutes because you don’t exactly know what to expect,” Slot said about Chiesa.  “Yes, I see him on the training pitch, but ideally, it would be better to see him in a friendly during the week, or in an Under-21 match or something like that. But this is not our situation: we play so many matches. So maybe the game against Southampton could be a good moment for him to get some minutes on the field, and then we’ll know a bit better what we can expect from him.  “If you only have training sessions, it’s not the same as game time. You need game time to reach certain levels of fitness. But if you are fighting for the championship and fighting in the Champions League, it’s not always easy to find these minutes unless sometimes we are ahead 4-0 or 5-0, but I think that has only happened once all season.“ Chiesa has lost his place on the national team. Leaving Liverpool could increase his chances of regaining Luciano Spalletti’s trust, so a January return to Italy could be a genuine possibility for the versatile forward.

According to Radio Kiss Kiss via TMW, Partenopei sporting director Giovanni Manna has switched his sights on Inter stalwart Stefan de Vrij. Danilo has recently emerged as a concrete transfer target for Napoli after losing his indispensable first-team status under Thiago Motta. However, long-term injuries to Gleison Bremer and Juan Cabal have thrown the Brazilian veteran a lifeline at the Allianz Stadium. Strapped for reliable options at the back, Motta has reinstated Danilo, whose deal at Juventus runs out at the end of the season. Napoli had hoped to capitalize on the 33-year-old’s contract wobble before deciding to focus on other targets.  Juventus are having second thoughts about Danilo’s future at the club. After initially deciding against renewing his expiring contract, they are now open to offering him a short-term extension. Therefore, Napoli have identified De Vrij as a new top defensive target. The 32-year-old Dutchman has been outstanding since swapping Lazio for Giuseppe Meazza in 2018. However, he’ll be out of contract in the summer of 2025, with Inter seemingly reluctant to propose fresh terms. That could change if De Vrij continues to go from strength to strength. Indeed, the rumored Napoli target has excelled in Francesco Acerbi’s absence, delivering outstanding performances in numerous high-profile matches. Despite entering the autumn of his playing career, De Vrij is still one of the most dependable center-backs in Serie A. Your email address will not be published.

According to Sky Sport via Calciomercato, the Roma loanee left the hospital on Friday afternoon after recovering from cardiac arrest.  Bove underwent surgery on December 10 for the implantation of the removable subcutaneous defibrillator. The subcutaneous defibrillator implanted is removable, and Bove will have the option to keep it or have it removed based on the results of future medical evaluations. The 22-year-old collapsed on the pitch in a Serie A meeting between Fiorentina and Inter on December 1. Heart-stopping moments at Stadio Artemio Franchi sent shockwaves through the football community in Italy and abroad.  Quickly after being admitted to the hospital, the Fiorentina youngster spent a couple of days in the intensive care unit of Careggi before being transferred to the UTC. Thankfully, Bove has fully recovered and is ready to return to Viola Park to greet his teammates and manager, Raffaele Palladino. However, Bove’s career in Serie A is over. He will no longer be allowed to compete in professional sports in Italy, mirroring the case of Christian Eriksen, who had to leave Inter in 2021.  The Fiorentina starlet must wait to receive comprehensive documentation from his tests, which will determine whether his myocarditis is genetic or inflammatory in origin, helping to assess the potential risks he might face moving forward.

According to a report by Daniele Longo, Juventus and Inter are eyeing a potential free transfer for Leverkusen’s Tah next summer. The German defender’s contract with Xabi Alonso’s side expires in June 2025 and any club interested in him can agree on a transfer without dealing with his current club. Juventus and Inter do not want to miss out on a strong and proven centre-back as they aim to send him proposals this winter but it appears that Barcelona have emerged as the frontrunners in the race to land Tah. The Blaugranas’ sporting director Deco has contacted the 28-year-old’s entourage but is yet to accept their conditions.  As for the Italian sides, neither Juventus nor Inter can match the Tah’s demands but negotiations are set to take place even though Barcelona have the edge.    Trambak Bhattacherjee | GIFN @2024 - All Rights Reserved.

We started slowly because of the short turnaround with the previous campaign. We got back on track. At the end of August, we would have signed to be in this situation in the Champions League and Serie A.” Bastoni addressed the loss to Bayer Leverkusen. “A defeat is never easy to stomach, but, analyzing everything, you just need to look at where Bayern Munich, Manchester City, and Real Madrid are to see that we’re doing well. If you are used to excellence, you have to maintain that standard. Clearly, we can’t win every game. It’s ludicrous to argue with the rotations. It wouldn’t be normal to always be 100 percent mentally. And the team suffers if you aren’t. Resting is essential.” Bastoni had the chance to leave in the past. “Some sides inquired about me, but I’ve always given my priority to Inter. There’s a life outside of football, and my family is great here. Plus, this club fights to win every competition. I’ve never given half a thought to leaving.” The center-back discussed Simone Inzaghi. “His virtue is that he makes everybody feel part of the group and fundamental to the cause. Instead, a defect was maybe that we had trouble understanding his football at first. That’s partly up to us since had Antonio Conte who was completely different.” Bastoni made his pick between winning another Scudetto or reaching the Champions League final again. “Surely the latter. We lacked some luck and self-awareness in Istanbul. We know that we’re at that level now.” Your email address will not be published.

The defender is reportedly close to agreeing to a contract with Barcelona, but the race is still somewhat open. He denied having convened with Blaugrana director Deco after the reports. According to La Gazzetta dello Sport, the Nerazzurri have no doubts about his level and fit. His performance against them further proved it. On the other hand, they aren’t the only side chasing him, and his demands are significant. The summit between the Inter brass and the entourage of Tah was mostly preliminary. The parties set the stage for possible future discussions. The salary requested by the defender is too high for the Serie A side’s standards at this stage, but they haven’t completely shut the door for now. Oaktree plots to progressively do away with Bosman signings involving veterans with high wages. On the other hand, the German international isn’t too old, as he’s 28. The outcome of their chase depends on how much other teams will offer. In the meantime, the Scudetto holders are mulling whether to add to their backline in January already. Francesco Acerbi continues to struggle to stay healthy. He’s not expected to return versus Lazio either. Despite Udinese’s stance, Jaka Bijol would be their top target if they opted to make a move. He’ll be a great get for whoever signs him, but it’d be surprising if it were the Nerazzurri given the latest hints about their future strategy. They are getting close to having to sign one more man in January. Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked * Comment *  Name *  Email *  Website

Reeling from Tuesday's 1-0 loss at Bayer Leverkusen, Simone Inzaghi's side remain without injured defensive pillars Francesco Acerbi and Benjamin Pavard ahead of Monday's visit to his former club. Inter's 573-minute run without conceding a goal in the Champions League ended when Nordi Mukiele scored for Leverkusen in the 90th minute on Tuesday. That capped a miserable trip to Germany for Inter, who failed to record a single shot on target in a Champions League game for the first time since February 2022 (versus Liverpool), and for the first time on record (since 2003-04) in the competition's first round.  Lazio, meanwhile, have racked up consecutive victories over Napoli in league and cup, with the Biancocelesti facing Ajax in the Europa League on Thursday before returning to Serie A action. Inter could be six points off the top by the time they take to the field for that headline fixture, with Atalanta targeting a piece of history at Cagliari on Saturday.

Another victory would make this their best-ever winning run in the competition.

Until now, Atalanta had never led the top-flight table as many as 15 matches into a campaign. They are big favourites to maintain their winning streak against 15th-placed Cagliari, with Gasperini having no new injury concerns. Giorgio Scalvini is out, having sustained a shoulder injury ahead of Tuesday's Champions League 3-2 loss to Real Madrid, while Gianluca Scamacca and Juan Cuadrado are longer-term absentees. While both Inter and Atalanta were beaten in Europe this week, Juventus claimed a huge result by beating Manchester City 2-0, courtesy of goals from Dusan Vlahovic and Weston McKennie. The Bianconeri's triumph came despite them only having 31% of possession – only once previously on record (since 2003-04) have they won a Champions League game while having a lower share of possession (27% versus Chelsea in September 2021).  In Serie A, however, it has been a case of possession without purpose for Juventus, who remain unbeaten but have drawn nine of their 15 matches, including each of their last three, to sit sixth. ""Nothing bothers me. I perfectly accept all honest judgements, but I won't enter this story,"" Juve coach Thiago Motta said, when asked about criticism of their domestic form. ""I am only focused on my work: improving the team and helping my players. The rest doesn’t count much."" With last-placed Venezia travelling to Turin on Saturday, Motta should be confident of maintaining the feel-good factor built in midweek.  Juventus have dominated this fixture historically, winning 10 of their last 12 Serie A matches against the newly promoted side.

It’s the first time it has happened in three years. The Nerazzurri were seemingly settling for a draw but gave up a late goal. Per La Gazzetta dello Sport, they had last failed to have an attempt on goal back in February of 2022 in a Champions League bout versus Liverpool. While their results have been sound, their frontline hasn’t been fearsome. Marcus Thuram has been their lone consistent scorer, while Lautaro Martinez has been up and down, and their deputies, including Mehdi Taremi, whom they landed after a lengthy chase, have brought very little to the table. While that’s not a surprise for Marko Arnautovic and Joaquin Correa, who have seen the pitch sparingly, Inter were expecting more from the Iranian marksman. He has started in every continental match but has found the target just once. He has yet to do it in Serie A. While Thuram has carried the burden, Martinez has hit the net six times and is way behind schedule relative to his standards. He has squandered major chances too. The issue is there but it’s a first-word one for now. They have still collectively bagged 34 goals in Serie A, which makes them the second-most prolific side league-wide, and their results haven’t suffered. El Toro isn’t new to multi-month slumps, and they’ll go on a run once he catches fire. It’ll be a problem for other sides since Thuram has gone up a level and his pace seems totally sustainable.

His agent and intermediary Serxhio Mezi revealed that he has been in touch with the Azzurri to set up the deal in an interview with Tribuna. “I’ve been talking with Napoli for a year. He could have joined them last January. We discussed about it with director Mauro Meluso and worked on such a transfer with Ciro Palermo. I don’t know if the deal will go through, but the two presidents are friendly, which could help in the negotiation.” Instead, Mezi instead dismissed the chatter about Inter and Juventus. “He’s been linked, but there’s nothing there. Thiago Motta didn’t want him when he was at Bologna. I doubt that the Bianconeri will chase him even if they are looking for a center-back.” Ismajli is in a particular situation because his contract lasts only until the end of the season. “Do you think a Serie A team would spend €2M, €3M, or €4M for a 29-year-old player they could sign on a free in June? Napoli are a different matter. He was offered to Roma and Daniele De Rossi too. Though, they discarded him because they didn’t think he was ready for that level.” It looks like the Partenopei have the inside track. Being a reliable deputy in a top team is arguably the right dimension for him. Perhaps a multi-player deal or a short-term renewal with a low release clause would facilitate a small investment in light of his contractual status. Your email address will not be published.

The boss has indicated Patrick Dorgu as a priority, Il Mattino informs (via OneFootball). The Partenopei would go back to using a three-man defense if they signed the Lecce starlet. He’d man the left flank, with Mathias Olivera, or a newcomer, behind him. On the other hand, the Salentini have dug their heels in about his permanence. Plus, they demand a boatload of money, around €40M. Conte has indicated that he’d be more than happy if Napoli managed to sign Joshua Zirkzee. They tried last summer already, but his valuation was excessive in their opinion. The striker’s future is in Ruben Amorin’s hands. Juventus have let it be known that they’ll keep Danilo till his contract expires. Torino don’t want to negotiate for Samuele Ricci either. The Azzurri will have an easier time buying from smaller sides. They are discussing Ardian Ismajli and Jacopo Fazzini with Empoli. They have an excellent relationship with Hellas Verona and set sights on Jackson Tchatchoua, Diego Coppola, and Reda Belahyane. Napoli met with the agent of Francesco Pio Esposito, but Inter have no plans to cash in on him. Cyril Ngonge could transfer to Parma on loan as a sort of down payment for Ange-Yoan Bonny, who’s likely to join next summer. Director Giovanni Manna is evaluating Becir Omeragic to bolster the defense. He broke out with Zurich in Switzerland before heading to Ligue 1 in a free move in 2023.

It was a 90th minute goal from Nordi Mukiele that helped Leverkusen pick up the win and it was the first goal that Inter have conceded in the entire Champions League campaign. Inter showed little in attack as they lacked the final ball throughout. Leverkusen hit the bar once in the first half, as Inter didn’t manage to pull off anything of note in attack in the second half. Simone Inzaghi spoke to Sky after the game and he expressed disappointment about the performance from his players. He said, as relayed by TMW: “It wasn’t one of our best games, but we were facing an opponent of absolute value who approached the game better. After the crossbar we controlled the game, maybe a little too much, we could have dared more but we lacked quality in the last 25 meters.  “Then it’s a shame to lose in this way because it takes away our unbeaten run but it doesn’t affect our path, we will probably still be in the top eight. It will be decided in January, but we will have our destiny in our hands.” Speaking about the goal that Inter conceded in the 90th minute, the Italian said: “There was also a deflection, Darmian saw it at the last minute but at that moment we should have been more careful. In the second half we had done worse than the first, but there were no warnings.  “But this is the Champions League and we move forward with our heads held high, with a positive result you keep this team behind you who also showed tonight that they deserve to be among the top, but we will think about it from January. We will analyse it calmly, we did not play a great game but there is great respect for the opponent who was of great quality.” Inter are fourth in the Champions League and on the way to the next round. A win in the remaining few games can guarantee them qualification.         Kaustubh Pandey I GIFN @2024 - All Rights Reserved. Get Football Group",

It was Inter’s first defeat in this season’s UEFA Champions League, complicating Simone Inzaghi’s bid to lead the Nerazzurri to automatic knockout qualification. Inter headed into the game in high spirits after a 3-1 Serie A win against Parma last Friday, seeking a piece of continental history. The reigning Scudetto holders had kept a clean sheet in the opening five league-phase rounds. As a result, they could’ve become the first-ever team in the Champions League to commence a new season with six successive shutouts. Truth be told, they were only a few minutes away from achieving that feat, only for Nordi Mukiele’s 90th-minute strike to crush the Italians’ dreams. In all fairness, it was nothing less than Leverkusen deserved, considering they had Inter on the ropes all game. For context, Inzaghi’s charges finished the match without a shot on target.  It was one of Inter’s least impressive attacking performances this season. Whether it was a tactical choice or only a bad night, the Nerazzurri were on the back foot for most of the game and eventually paid the ultimate price. Without further ado, let’s look at our Inter ratings.  Yann Sommer – 6.5 Mukiele left him no chance from point-blank, yet the Swiss goalkeeper was spotless in all other situations, averting every danger that came his way.  Yann Bisseck – 6 Slotted in for Benjamin Pavard, the 24-year-old German often struggled to cope with Florian Wirtz’s tricky feet but excelled in the aerial duels, proving a decent back-up for the Frenchman. Stefan de Vrij – 7 Another remarkable performance from the Dutch veteran! He didn’t put his foot wrong tonight but had to helplessly watch Mukiele firing Leverkusen in front.  Alessandro Bastoni – 6.5 While he did his defensive job to a ‘T,’ the Italian star center-back wasn’t as comfortable on the ball as in most Inter matches this season.  Carlos Augusto – 6 While he got the Inter supporters used to scintillating crosses and overlapping runs, he was virtually invisible in attack, focusing more on helping his side under the siege.  Piotr Zielinski – 6 Barring several fancy flicks and show-off moments, the Polish ace struggled to impact the play, being part of the reason why Inter lost the midfield battle to Leverkusen. Hakan Calhanoglu – 5.5 Unable to get on the ball frequently enough, the Turkish playmaker had a quiet evening by his standards. One of his weakest showings this season! Davide Frattesi – 6 Despite his tireless runs in the center of the park, the Italy international was ineffective in possession, failing to get Inter’s midfield moving in Nicolo Barella’s absence. Matteo Darmian – 6 Solid at the back but nowhere to be seen in attack, the experienced wingback fared well against Alex Grimaldo, sacrificing his offensive movements for the greater good. Marcus Thuram – 5 Often left on an island, the Frenchman endured a frustrating night. He never had a clear sight of goal, while the lack of support in the final third led to numerous chip turnovers. Mehdi Taremi – 4 The Iranian’s rough patch at Inter continued with another disheartening performance.  Federico Dimarco – 6 Kristjan Asllani – 5.5 Nicolo Barella – 6 Lautaro Martinez – 5 Marko Arnautovic – N/A Your email address will not be published.

BayArena sets the stage for a heavyweight clash between reigning Bundesliga and Serie A champions, with the automatic qualification spot on the line. Despite a stuttering start to their title defense on the domestic front, Xabi Alonso’s men are on course to secure a last-16 berth at Europe’s top table. Leverkusen humbled out-of-sorts RB Salzburg 5-0 in the previous round to lift to sixth in the 36-team table, albeit level on points with ninth-placed Aston Villa.  Given the fierce competition for automatic promotion, there’s almost no wriggle room as Die Werkself head into proceedings seeking a sixth consecutive win in all competitions. A tight 2-1 home triumph against Bundesliga newcomers St. Pauli at the weekend ensured Leverkusen didn’t lose further ground on table-topping Bayern Munich. Buoyed by their ongoing purple patch, the German giants entertain high-flying Inter on home turf in the first Champions League meeting between the teams in over two decades. Indeed, the Nerazzurri faced Leverkusen in the 2002/03 second stage, pulling off victories in both legs, including a 2-0 win on this ground.  Inter will aim to replicate that success on Tuesday and take a potentially vital step to clinch a coveted top-eight finish. The 20-time Serie A champions have enjoyed a stellar European campaign thus far, winning four successive matches without conceding since a scoreless draw at Manchester City on matchday one.  As a result, they sit second in the standings, two points adrift of table-topping Liverpool pre-round.  Bayer Leverkusen With three points separating them from Inter ahead of the kick-off, Leverkusen could leapfrog their opposition in the table if only they can defy a 100% lose ratio in this fixture. In addition to losing both legs in the Champions League 21 years ago, Die Werkself suffered a 2-1 defeat to the Nerazzurri in their 2019/20 UEFA Europa League quarter-final one-off tie. Driven by revenge, Alonso’s lads will be out to pull off a league-phase double against both San Siro clubs after seeing off Milan 1-0 in round two. Adding to Leverkusen’s confidence, they’ve emerged victorious from seven of their last eight home outings in major UEFA competitions (D1), winning both such encounters this season ‘to nil.’ Triumphs against Milan and Salzburg form part of Leverkusen’s telling nine-game unbeaten run at the BayArena (W7, D2), with four of those seven wins seeing them score 3+ goals. Delivering action from the onset, five of Leverkusen’s last seven home games have featured a goal on or before the tenth minute.  Inter History beckons for Inter as they bid to become the first Italian club since Juventus in 2012/13 to win five consecutive Champions League fixtures without conceding. Achieving that feat would, in turn, mark an unprecedented milestone in this competition’s history, making the Nerazzurri the first team to keep a clean sheet in the first six matches of a specific campaign.  Inter will make this journey in high spirits after winning their last five competitive away matches, looking to defy an indifferent record across their four most recent Champions League travels (W1, D2, L1). With four of those five victories coming ‘to nil,’ the visitors seem well-positioned to enter the Champions League folklore.  Furthermore, Simone Inzaghi’s charges eased past newly promoted Parma 3-1 last Friday to extend their formidable unbeaten streak in all competitions to 13 matches (W11, D2) and consolidate their Scudetto defense. Patrik Schick’s availability is up in the air. The Czech forward has sustained a calf injury and will likely skip this contest alongside Jonas Hofmann and Amine Adli. Schick isn’t the only missing forward in the Leverkusen camp, as Victor Boniface hasn’t played for the club since returning from international duty with a thigh problem. On the other hand, Benjamin Pavard is the only Inter star out of contention for the matchday squad. Indeed, Davide Frattesi, Francesco Acerbi, and Carlos Augusto have regained full fitness and will be at Inzaghi’s disposal for this blockbuster showdown. Bayer Leverkusen (3-5-2): Kovar; Tapsoba, Tah, Hincapie; Frimpong, Xhaka, Andrich, Garcia, Grimaldo; Wirtz, Tella.  Inter (3-5-2): Sommer; Bisseck, De Vrij, Bastoni; Dumfries, Barella, Calhanoglu, Zielinski, Dimarco; Thuram, Taremi It’s hard to put it past Leverkusen to become the first Champions League team this season to break Inter’s rock-solid backline. However, we cannot envisage the Italians’ slip-up. On the contrary, Inzaghi’s men are in good shape to end the Germans’ revival. Prediction: Inter to Win Your email address will not be published.

On his 125th Champions League appearance, Lewandowski netted his landmark goal from the penalty spot just 10 minutes in at Estadi Olimpic Lluis Companys, after he was barged over by Brest goalkeeper Marco Bizot. Dani Olmo made matters more comfortable for Barca, who squandered several chances to add to their lead and looked vulnerable to counter-attacks at times, midway through the second half. Olmo skilfully evaded a glut of defenders in the box and squeezed in a finish that deflected in off Bizot. And Lewandowski fittingly added further gloss in stoppage time to move onto 101 goals in UEFA's flagship cup competition. Barca moved up to second in the 36-team standings, with 12 points, one point behind leaders Inter. Data Debrief: Ton up for in-form Lewy Lewandowski is the third player to score 100 goals in the Champions League, after Lionel Messi (129) and Cristiano Ronaldo (140). The Barca striker, however, took the fewest shots (451) to reach the milestone, with Messi needing 527 to get there, and Ronaldo 793. Lewandowski netted 17 times in the competition for Borussia Dortmund, 69 times for Bayern Munich and now 15 times for the Blaugrana. Meanwhile, 22 of his Champions League goals have come under Hansi Flick. In all competitions this season, Lewandowski has now scored 22 goals in 19 appearances – nine more than any other LaLiga player. Indeed, he is only four goals shy of his total tally for last season (26 in 49 games). Barca, meanwhile, are the fifth team to win four successive European Cup/Champions League matches by at least three goals, after Paris Saint-Germain in 2017 (five), Bayern in 2020 and 2021 (four on both occasions), Leeds United in 1969 (four) and Reims in 1958 (four).

This is, to give them their full name, Stade Brestois 29’s first ever season of European football. They’ve never got past the quarter-final of the Coupe de France and their only league title came in Ligue 2 back in 1981. Barcelona, by comparison, have 27 Spanish league titles and five Champions League titles under their belt, though it is now a decade since they last won Europe’s most coveted trophy.  Brest go into this match in 12th place in Ligue 1 with four wins and seven defeats from their first twelve games, and they’ve lost their last three in a row in the league, too. But in the Champions League, they’ve shone. Three wins and a draw from their opening four matches have left them in fourth place in the sprawling 36-team ‘league’, actually two places on one point above Barcelona for now.   Barcelona had a bit of a nasty surprise at the weekend, when two goals in the last six minutes of their match away to Celta Vigo pegged them back to a 2-2 draw, although they do still lead LaLiga by four points. They’re in sixth place in the Champions League table, with three wins and a defeat from their opening four.  The main man for Barcelona so far this season has been Robert Lewandowski, with 15 goals in 14 in La Liga and 20 in 18 in all competitions. There were some raised eyebrows when the 36-year old went to Camp Nou in 2022, but his form this season has demonstrated that there’s life in the old dog yet.   There are few such celebrities in the Brest squad – their summer spending in preparation for the new season amounted to only just over €10m – though followers of the Premier League may be interested to know that there are two players in their squad currently on loan from clubs from England’s top division; Romain Faivre (Bournemouth) and Abdallah Sima (Brighton).  Barcelona have well documented injury problems. Ronald Araújo, Ansu Fati, Andreas Christensen, Marc-André ter Stegen and Marc Bernal are all unavailable, while Lamine Yamal, Eric García and Ferran Torres are also unlikely to play.  Such matters aren’t much better for Brest. Massadio Haïdara, Faivre and Soumaïla Coulibaly are all likely to miss out, while Bradley Locko is out for the long-term with Achilles tendon damage. And there was a fresh headache in their 3-2 loss at Monaco last weekend with an injury to Pierre Lees-Malou. The aforementioned Sima faces a fitness test.  Barcelona’s injury situation isn’t great and there are questions to be asked over the sloppy way in which they turned a 2-0 lead into a 2-2 draw at Celta Vigo last time out. But Brest have their injuries too and have had a moderate start to their league season. Their Champions League wins have come against reasonably modest opposition – Sturm Graz, Salzburg and Sparta Prague – and it’s difficult to see past a comfortable home win on this occasion. So Barcelona by three.    (Cover image from IMAGO)   You can follow every game from the Champions League with FotMob this season — featuring deep stats coverage, xG, and player ratings.

Barca went on a remarkable seven-game winning streak through October and early November before stumbling to a 1-0 loss at Real Sociedad and a 2-2 draw at Celta Vigo in LaLiga, with Lamine Yamal absent from both matches. After losing their opening Champions League match to Monaco, Barcelona have since won three in a row, including a thumping 4-1 win over Bayern Munich. Flick, who took charge in May, said his young squad need to learn to cope with adversity and that a positive result against Brest would be a good start. ""The important thing is to win and that is our focus for tomorrow's game,"" Flick told a press conference. ""It's about eliminating the mistakes, this is important. We have a lot of things we can do better with the ball and this is the focus. ""We have a young team, the youngest in LaLiga, and it's not always an easy ride... It is important that the players know that they are good, that they have quality and that they have to stick together. ""We want to teach them and I always think positively. It's a young team and during the season it's normal to have times like this. For me, the important thing is to learn from it."" Barcelona will again be without Yamal for their Champions League tie as he continues to recover from an ankle sprain, with the team having lost all three LaLiga games which he has not started this season. He has been pivotal to the Blaugrana this campaign and is the only player across Europe's big five leagues to complete 25+ dribbles (34), create 25+ chances (26), have 25+ shots (39), score 5+ goals (five) and provide 5+ assists (seven). ""We all know how talented he [Yamal] is and how his quality on the pitch can impact a game,"" Flick added. ""Lamine has a quality that allows you to have more control of possession but also makes the opponent give us more space. ""I think and hope that this will be the last game he misses because [on Monday] he was looking very good [in training] but we will have to wait. I hope that on Saturday he will be an option... maybe from the bench... but we'll see."" Defender Inigo Martinez backed his teammates to overcome Yamal's absence. ""We know how important Lamine is... he gives us a lot, is a difference maker who pushes the defensive line back, he is aggressive, generates assists and a lot of fear in the opponent,"" Martinez said. ""He is vital and very important, but that doesn't mean that the next player to come on won't be up to the similar level. ""Anyone who jumps in at Barcelona needs to be capable of playing at the highest level. The day that Lamine doesn't play, and we win, this chat that we can't win without him will vanish.

Greenwood converted from 12 yards with just a minute of normal time remaining, moving Marseille up to second in the table and ahead of Monaco on goal difference. The spot-kick was awarded for a handball from full-back Christian Mawissa as Marseille ended a three-game winless run against Monaco in the league. Valentin Rongier's poor pass in the first half had earlier allowed Aleksandr Golovin to counter-attack and open the scoring with just his second Ligue 1 goal of the campaign. Luis Henrique subsequently levelled before the hour, capitalising on some fine work from Neal Maupay, before Greenwood snatched victory for Roberto De Zerbi's side. At the other end of the table, bottom side Montpellier salvaged a 2-2 draw with fourth-placed Lille thanks to Arnaud Nordin's last-gasp leveller in an ill-tempered clash. Jonathan David had earlier scored a penalty in either half for the visitors, with Issiaga Sylla on target for Montpellier on the stroke of half-time to level after the Lille forward's first spot-kick. Montpellier head coach Jean-Louis Gasset was sent off late on before Tanguy Coulibaly and Mitchel Bakker were both dismissed in a chaotic ending. Coulibaly prompted the altercation by kicking the ball against Lille head coach Bruno Genesio, with Bakker and the Montpellier man taking the punishment for the clash that subsequently followed.

The expected goal difference between Dortmund (0.58) against Hoffenheim (1.18) says it all. Dortmund simply weren’t good enough today, even with the energy of the yellow wall behind them. Christian Ilzer’s side came to play tonight, and the new Hoffenheim coach showed exactly why Hoffenheim chose him to take over after the dismissal of Pellegrino Matarazzo. The first 45 minutes were very scrappy, with both teams struggling to create chances. Hoffenheim efficiently played out of BVB’s press, and they managed to shut down Felix Nmecha in the midfield, hindering him in progressing the ball as we’ve seen a lot lately.  When Gio Reyna fired Dortmund to 1-0 within the first minute of the second half, my spirits were high. Sadly, Gio Reyna’s goal seemed to be just one brilliant moment within 90 minutes of very mediocre football from BVB. Despite Sahin’s team having shown decent performances lately, they never really came out of first gear, and they were finally punished in stoppage time, when former BVB player, Jacob Bruun Larsen, wrestled the young Yannik Lührs off the ball inside the box and slotted the ball past Gregor Kobel.  As this draw wasn’t frustrating enough in itself, Yan Couto also had to be subbed off due to injury, which means that there are now barely three first team players at Sahin’s disposal in defense. The winter break can’t really come quick enough at this point. So. Which players were less bad than the others tonight? Below you’ll find my nominees for MOTM. Can’t really get around it. If Gio hadn’t rocketed the ball into the net a handful of seconds into the second half, Dortmund would have dropped all three points at home tonight. Although Gio scored, he also had some very frustrating moments—most notably a sequence when he was played in behind and managed to trip over the ball, resulting in a wasted opportunity. Let’s at least hope that Gio can play himself into some kind of good form, because BVB simply need bodies at the moment. I think Nico Schlotterbeck was once again solid tonight. Strong in clearances and not at fault for the goal scored. He’ll also get a bonus point for not letting Gittens get himself sent off when the young Englishman was severely provoked by Arther Chaves. I don’t know if Schlotterbeck played through some pain tonight, but if he did, it was hard to see. I don’t really think it was that much Nmecha’s fault that he wasn’t able to impose himself on the game as much as one could’ve hoped. Hoffenheim simply knew his importance to this team, and they expertly blocked Dortmund’s passing lanes to the German international. Despite less involvement, I think Nmecha did well when he actually had the ball at his feet. He seemed very tired at the end, but that’s fully understandable given how much he has played lately. Bensebaini honestly did almost everything you could ask of him. The team as a whole just didn’t manage to get up the pitch today, which meant that the Algerian international had to do quite a lot of defending. He won the majority of his duels, and he had some decent crosses from set pieces. Gambling Problem? Call 1-800-GAMBLER (1-800-426-2537). Hope is here.

From a Dortmund perspective, the first half was very underwhelming. They struggled to create any meaningful chance to trouble Oliver Baumann in the Hoffenheim net, in fact, they had just one shot in the entire first half. Dortmund were awarded a penalty after what was originally deemed a foul on Serhou Guirassy from Arthur Chaves, but VAR, rightly, overturned the decision. For Hoffenheim, they also failed to have a shot on target but looked a lot more dangerous than Dortmund especially when they were going forward.  However, in the second half, Dortmund started very quickly when Giovanni Reyna scored his first Bundesliga goal in 582 days as he latched onto a poor clear from Hoffenheim. This trend did not last long as Hoffenheim continued to be the better side and Dortmund were unable to create any meaningful chances, shown by the fact they created no big chances in the whole game. Hoffenheim on the other hand continued to push for equalisers and they were rewarded late on when ex-Dortmund Jacob Bruun Larsen prodded home.  For Hoffenheim, the result was probably unjust as they would feel like they could have come away with the three points, which goes to show the positive work that Christian Ilzer has done since arriving from Sturm Graz. While Dortmund were not good and lacked any creative spark and were lucky to draw this game. The positive for Dortmund is that on his return from injury, Karim Adeyemi looked lively but he was still unable to make up for the lack of creative spark. Apart from that it is clear that Dortmund need more options in the creativity department as without Julian Brandt and Jamie Gittens not at his best today, Dortmund had nothing.  Gregor Kobel (5), Yan Couto (5), Emre Can (6), Nico Schlotterbeck (6), Ramy Bensebaini (6), Felix Nmecha (6), Pascal Groß (4), Maximilian Beier (4), Giovanni Reyna (6), Jamie Gittens (5), Serhou Guirassy (6) Others: Karim Adeyemi (6), Marcel Sabitzer (5), Kjell Wätjen (5), Julien Duranville (5), Yannik Lührs (-) Oliver Baumann (6), Valentin Gendrey (6), Arthur Chaves (4), Stanley N’soki (5), Alexander Prass (6), Tom Bischof (6), Anton Stach (6), Diadie Samassékou (4), Andrej Kramaric (6), Max Moerstadt (5), Adam Hlozek (5) Others: Jacob Bruun Larsen (6), Haris Tabakovic (5), Dennis Geiger (5), Paul Hennrich (-), Kevin Akpoguma (-) GGFN | Jack Meenan  @2023 - All Rights Reserved.

Borussia Dortmund have only two games remaining before they get a nice long break during the Bundesliga’s Winterpause. They currently sit in ninth place. They don’t have any more matches in the Champions League until late January. All Nuri Sahin and his men need to do is stay within spitting distance of the top four to be able to recover and try to go on a run in the second half of the Bundesliga season. The first obstacle in Dortmund’s path is TSG Hoffenheim, a club that has historically given it problems, but that has struggled to stay afloat so far, currently sitting only three points above the relegation playoff spot, and have one of the worst expected goal differences in the league. Despite making several large (by their standards) transfers over the summer, including signing Adam Hlozek from Bayer Leverkusen, Hoffenheim have been flirting with relegation. It’s already cost the job of one manager, Pellegrino Matarazzo, who was sacked in November and replaced by Christian Ilzer, who joined from Sturm Graz.  I really had no choice but to pick Andrej Kramaric. This guy has tortured us BVB fans for years, and believe it or not, he is still Hoffenheim’s top offensive threat. He leads Hoffenheim in combined goals and assists, despite being in the midst of a long goal slump. The problem is that nobody else on Hoffenheim has been playing that well, and to be honest, Kramaric could be playing on one leg and I would still pick him to score against Dortmund.  Nuri Sahin will have to deal with one question above all else: who the heck is going to play center-back? Nico Schlotterbeck, Niklas Süle, and Waldemar Anton are all injured. Those are all three of this club’s established, full-time, and first-team center-backs. So that’s bad enough; but according to Ruhr Nachrichten, Filippo Mané, who’s probably the most appropriate replacement from the youth ranks, is also hurt! Nuri Sahin will have to get creative.  Emre Can clearly can play center-back, but Sahin will need at least one more recruit. I’m guessing that it will be Ramy Bensebaini. I’ve looked through his match logs on FBref, and he not only has he played center-back a few times with Dortmund and Mönchengladbach, but he seems to routinely play center-back for Algeria. Unfortunately, that simply shifts the burden from center-back to full-back, because as of Friday, Julian Ryerson was questionable  to play against Hoffenheim. Yan Couto can play right-back, while the 18-year-old Almugera Kabar can stand in at left-back.  In midfield, the situation is hardly any better. Julian Brandt is still questionable, but at least Felix Nmecha and Marcel Sabitzer are healthy, and Gio Reyna and Pascal Groß are both healthy. It was the former who played in for Brandt on Wednesday, Surprisingly, it’s in attack that Dortmund are the healthiest. Karim Adeyemi was theoretically healthy on Wednesday, but it seems that Sahin is being cautious with him, so I’m not sure he’ll play tomorrow.  How do you think this makeshift back line will fare against Hoffenheim? Is Kabar ready for primetime? Let me know your thoughts!  Gambling Problem? Call 1-800-GAMBLER (1-800-426-2537). Hope is here.

Add on to this the injuries to Niklas Süle and Waldemar Anton and Dortmund have no centre-backs.

Nuri Sahin's side suffered a 3-2 defeat to Barcelona in the Champions League on Wednesday, a result that left them ninth in the league phase table with 12 points. The performance raised concerns about Dortmund’s defensive frailty, particularly their counter-attack susceptibility. BVB are currently in a challenging spell and has been winless in their last three matches. However, two of those games were against top-tier opponents in Barcelona and Bayern München. In the Bundesliga, their recent form is mixed, with two wins, two draws, and two losses in their last six matches. At home, Dortmund have faltered recently, going winless in their last two fixtures at Signal Iduna Park. However, they had won their previous eight home games, and the loss to Barcelona remains their only defeat at the stadium this season. Team News In encouraging news for Dortmund, forward Karim Adeyemi is expected to return after being sidelined since October. While his fitness may restrict him to a substitute role, he could feature in place of one of Donyell Malen, Marcel Sabitzer, or Jamie Gittens. However, Dortmund remain without attackers Julian Brandt and Maximilian Beier, who are sidelined with hamstring and knee injuries, respectively. Defensive options are also limited, with Nico Schlotterbeck, Niklas Süle, and Waldemar Anton all unavailable. This shortage may force Nuri Sahin to deploy midfielder Emre Can as a central defender alongside Ramy Bensebaini in a makeshift back four. As for the visitors, Hoffenheim, while only three points clear of 16th-placed Heidenheim, who currently sit in the relegation playoff spot, they will likely take some encouragement from their recent draw with Freiburg. The result marked a positive step after enduring three consecutive defeats in their prior outings. Hoffenheim, led by boss Christian Ilzer, came into the game following a 0-0 draw against FCSB in the Europa League on Thursday. The match saw both sides create three big chances, but neither could capitalise. In the Bundesliga, Hoffenheim have scored 18 goals and conceded 25, placing them 12th in offensive rankings and tying for the fourth-worst defensive record in the league. Their away form, however, has been a major concern, with the team failing to secure a win in their last ten road games, losing six and drawing four during this stretch. Team News For Hoffenheim, injuries have also similarly disrupted their squad. With Ozan Kabak, Florian Grillitsch, and Christopher Lenz all ruled out, Arthur Chaves and Stanley N’Soki are expected to start in central defence ahead of goalkeeper Oliver Baumann. In attack, Adam Hložek is likely to lead the line, supported by Andrej Kramarić, Tom Bischof, and Jacob Bruun Larsen, given the absences of Marius Bülter and Ihlas Bebou. Meanwhile, the midfield could feature a partnership of Anton Stach and Diadié Samassékou due to the unavailability of Grischa Prömel, Umut Tohumcu, and Finn Becker.",

Borussia Dortmund welcomed high-flying Barcelona to the Westfalenstadion on Wednesday night for an evening of barely organized chaos in the Champions League. If not for some calamitous play on both sides of the ball late in the game, BVB might have come away with some points, too. Unfortunately, Barcelona’s Ferran Torres scored his second of the night in the 85th minute to put Barcelona 3-2 ahead and claim victory for the Catalan side. The game started relatively slow, with both sides exchanging some half chances early in the second half, but even then, there were warning signs of the chaos to come. Dortmund seemed willing to concede possession in the first half, attempting to play Hansi Flick’s Barcelona at their own game, but Barcelona’s high line and aggressive tempo proved far too tempting. In the second half, BVB were suckered into a very open game, precisely as Barcelona wanted. Despite the game being played at Los Blaugranas tempo, BVB held their own, and Şahin’s men will feel like they should have come away from this five-goal scrap with something to show for it. Dortmund gave Barça a good game, but they were wasteful in front of goal, and occasional defensive lapses and sloppy possession were gifts for this lethal Barcelona offense. However, Barcelona has made this kind of football their currency under Hansi Flick. They force their opponents to play this way and capitalize on the mistakes this creates. Dortmund’s loss on Wednesday means they are now ninth, just a point outside the automatic qualification spots for the knockout stages of the Champions League, with two games left in the league phase. Their last two opponents are Bologna and Shakhtar Donetsk. BVB must win at least one of those to avoid the playoffs. Here are our ratings from Wednesday’s 3-2 loss to Barcelona. Patrick: 6 It was not Kobel’s best night, but Barcelona’s finishing felt superb. It feels like Kobel would have saved one, maybe two, last season,  himself a 9/10 rating. This season, all three went in, and he earned a 6/10. Paul: 5 Kobel had a couple of bright moments, but they were negated by his less-than-perfect shot-stopping on both of Ferran Torres’s goals. Kobel spilled a Fermin Lopez shot into Torres’s path for Barcelona’s second (though Lopez’s shot was at a slightly awkward height), and he seemed to be slow to get down to try and make a save for the third. It was not his best night. Zac: 5 Kobel was beaten pretty handily for all three goals, although a stronger punch out for Torres’s first and better positioning for his second may prevent one of those two goals. Patrick: 6 Paul: 6 Zac: 7 100% effort for 45 minutes. I’m hoping his health scare isn’t too serious. Patrick: 6 Surprisingly, there is little to talk about for Can. He held his composure and looked like he belonged next to Nico Schlotterbeck.  Paul: 6 Zac: 7 Emre and Nico formed a formidable pair against Barça, and I would argue they were not at fault for any of the goals. Can’s composure on the ball helped beat the press several times. Patrick: 8 Schlotterbeck was Dortmund’s best player, and his injury is a huge loss for the club. He led the team in tackles, defensive actions, and clearances.  Paul: 8 Schlotterbeck’s defensive efforts were excellent. He deserved more from this game, especially after being carted off with a bad ankle injury late in the game. Zac: 8 Forceful, confident, and full of leadership. Hoping to see him again before 2025. That ankle bend had me fearing the worst. Patrick: 5 When playing the best teams in the world, you have to be perfect to prevent goals. Unfortunately, Bensebaini had two lapses in concentration during Barcelona’s first and second goals. Apart from those issues, it was a good game for the Algerian. Paul: 6 Zac: 5 Marshaled Lamine excellently for around 90% of the game, but was beaten for Barça’s third and out of position on the first. Patrick: 7 Nmecha is fantastic as Şahin’s press-resistant midfielder, transitioning the ball from defense to offense. He did well battling Barcelona’s midfield game, but his passing is still an issue, and he struggled to find Dortmund’s runners in transition. Paul: 7 Since finding his feet in this new role in Şahin’s XI, Nmecha has been one of Dortmund’s best and most consistent players. At this point, he is surely one of the first names on the timesheet. Zac: 6 Patrick: 4 A fantastic miss in the 17th minute set the pace early for a woeful performance. The calm, collected Sabitzer we saw in last season’s UCL Best Eleven is not present, and he struggles to make meaningful contributions on the ball. His runs into the box are great, but everything else is subpar. Paul: 4 Sabitzer was poor on Wednesda  night. He missed a decent chance early in the first half and picked up a silly yellow just before the break. The rest of the game, his contributions in ball progression and defensive effort when out of possession were below the level we’ve come to expect of the Austrian midfielder. Zac: 3 Sabi seems really, really short on composure this season. The calm, collected, and capable midfielder from last season is not on the pitch. We need him back. Patrick: 7 Paul: 6 Given how few minutes Reyna has played over the last year, playing over an hour of football against an opponent like Barcelona is a significant achievement. It wasn’t a dazzling performance, but he held his own and made a case for more playing time in the future. Zac: 6 It was great to see him on the field. Reyna delivered some dangerous balls and drew several fouls with his spatial awareness and trickery. Patrick: 7 A fantastic dribble and cut-back in the 17th minute should have been an assist. Apart from that, the young Belgian was a threat throughout his time on the pitch and was exciting to watch. His talent needs to be refined, but it is obvious. Paul: 7 The dual threat of Duranville and Gittens on both wings was a joy to watch. Duranville is still pretty raw, but you can see the talent there. Everyone loves a dribbly boi. Zac: 7  This was a very promising display of raw talent. Duranville’s development has been stunted, but the talent Dortmund signed is clearly still there. Patrick: 6 Paul: 6 Bar one moment late in the game, Gittens’ performance probably warrants a 7/10 (maybe even an 8/10 if you’re feeling generous). Unfortunately, that one outlier moment was some incredibly poor defending that led to Barcelona’s winning goal.  I don’t think Gittens was the main culprit in gifting Barcelona that late chance, but he was slow to react. After Barcelona turned it over, he seemed to momentarily stop his run to get back ahead of the ball. This lapse gave Pedri the space to pick his pass to Yamal, who laid it on a plate for Ferran Torres to score the winner. Gittens didn’t seem to have a good sense of his surroundings, either not seeing Pedri or thinking he was a teammate. He’s got to stay switched on. It’s a learning moment. Zac: 6 Jamie was, at times, Dortmund’s only outlet for ball progression. He was unable to turn it into goals, but not for a lack of trying.  Patrick: 7 I cannot fault a striker for scoring two goals in a match, but most Dortmund fans walked away from this one thinking the Guinean should have scored more! He underperformed his expected goals despite the two goals and could have grabbed one or two more.  Paul: 7 A classic striker’s performance! Guirassy was poor for the majority of the match. He was wasteful in front of goal and largely absent in the buildup. He also scored two goals (granted, one was from the penalty spot). You’ve had a good game when you score two goals, even if you were otherwise very frustrating. Zac: 7 I’m going to go the hard route. Guirassy should have had a highlight-reel performance against Barcelona. The service and chances were there, and he consistently fluffed his lines. A penalty and a “gimme” goal are not appropriate returns for how many opportunities he had. Patrick: 5 He brought energy and width into the attack after Duranville came off the pitch but struggled in defense. He failed to contribute anything to Dortmund’s defense besides being a warm body that Ferran Torres had to walk around. It is no coincidence that Barcelona found success on that left side after Ryerson came off the field. Paul: 5 It’s becoming a consistent issue that Couto is a liability on the defensive end and keeps coming into games with significant defensive demands after Ryerson has run himself into the ground. Either Couto needs to improve on the defensive end, or Ryerson needs some juice. Zac: 5 Couto struggled to impose himself.  Patrick: 5 The veteran midfielder entered the field and displayed his selflessness. His set-piece delivery was superb, and he handed his teammates chance after chance. Unfortunately for the host team, he also gave Barcelona a chance in the 85th minute, which they converted.  Paul: 6 Groß had some excellent moments in his 20-minute cameo at the end of the game. He put up a whopping 1.1 xAG, contributed five shot-creating actions (more than any other BVB player and only trailing Lamine Yamal’s eight), and grabbed an assist on BVB’s second goal. Then, with just five minutes left in the game and only Yan Couto held back as defensive cover, Groß knocked a looping ball back toward BVB’s goal, seemingly without a target, in a moment of madness that set off the sequence that led to Dortmund losing the game. Unforgivable from such an experienced player. Zac: 5 Groß came on with “10” energy only to create a horrible giveaway and leave with a 5. Patrick: 4 An 18-minute cameo for the Dutch forward, but he struggled to impose himself on the game. He managed one shot that was never going in and had some link-up-play with Couto. Little if anything apart from that. Paul: 5 Zac: 5 Patrick: 7 The first home loss of the season stings, considering Dortmund could have walked away with a marquee result. In reality, Şahin and his troops were beaten by one of Europe’s best teams. The stat line shows an even game where two giants went head-to-head, but the truth is much different. Yes, Dortmund did perform well, but simple mistakes across the field separated Borussia Dortmund from Barcelona. There is some promise in this game. I thought the team’s tactical setup looked good, and several players stepped up. Unfortunately for Şahin, the veterans brought in to solve mistakes, like Bensebaini, Groß, and Guirassy, let their teammates down in the vital moments. Paul: 7 Everyone is understandably frustrated that Dortmund came away from that game with a loss, but I think they still deserve some credit for the performance. Barcelona have been excellent this season, and it often comes off the back of stoking the kind of chaos we saw on Wednesday night, confident that they will come out on top, more often than not, when they draw teams into a slugfest. Dortmund took the bait, but they looked comfortable standing and trading with Barcelona and could easily have won the game. The frustration stems from the unforced errors that gave Barcelona’s offense help they didn’t need, while Dortmund’s persistent squandering of their own opportunities exacerbated the situation. It’s hard not to look at this as an opportunity lost. Nonetheless, I think we should be pleased that Dortmund were able to adapt and compete against an opponent like Barcelona. BVB fans haven’t been given much to cheer this season, but the performance Wednesday night, even in a loss, seems like signs of progress. Zac: 5 This was a good game from BVB, but not a great one. Şahin will rightly be frustrated (as he has already expressed). Still, his team was not clinical enough and not composed enough to truly threaten Barça, despite a suspect backline that seemed eager to award opportunities. Dortmund had a significantly shuffled lineup, but you do get the sense that the more these players see the field together, the more they may be able to make something work. The return of Karim Adeyemi will add another X factor to the BVB attack that should hopefully help convert some more of these opportunities. Schlotterbeck’s massive game identified him as one of BVB’s real, UCL-caliber stars. Hope to see him back in the armband soon.  Gambling Problem? Call 1-800-GAMBLER (1-800-426-2537). Hope is here.

Maximilian Beier and Julian Brandt both missed Wednesday's 2-3 defeat to FC Barcelona, while Julian Ryerson was forced off at the break. And speaking at a press conference on Friday, Borussia Dortmund coach Nuri Sahin was unsure about their availability against Hoffenheim. ""We will have to wait and see about Julian Ryerson. The same goes for Maxi Beier and Julian Brandt,"" said Sahin. As for Karim Adeyemi, who returned to the BVB bench against Barcelona after a lengthy spell on the sidelines, Sahin said he's careful not to rush him back into action too soon. ""Karim Adeyemi wanted to play against Barca. But we have to be careful. He's training very well, he's physically stable and he looks fresh. When you come back from injury, sometimes you feel like you're flying. He's a candidate for the last two games,"" Sahin said. After Nico Schlotterbeck was stretchered off against FC Barcelona, Dortmund released a brief injury update the following day, which seemed to indicate that the injury wasn't as serious as first feared. Sahin confirmed this on Friday. ""The diagnosis is positive, as far as I can tell.

Who needs them anyway! Borussia Dortmund’s exciting 2-3 loss to Barcelona yesterday ended on a bitter note - Nico Schlotterbeck was carried off the field after he landed poorly on his ankle in the dying embers of the game. The broadcast following the match was a mix of Barcelona’s celebrations and video of Schlotterbeck being carried off the field in a stretcher. It was difficult not to assume the worst as we watched the club’s last healthy center-back escorted off the field in tears.  The news, however, is much better than expected. Borussia Dortmund announced today that the 25-year-old German escaped any serious damage to his ankle and instead was ruled to have a “ligament injury”. Considering most, including Sahin. assumed there would be a broken bone or ruptured Achilles tendon, this is great news! The expectation is that Schlotterbeck will likely be out of the squad for the remainder of 2024 including Dortmund’s two remaining matches against Hoffenheim and Wolfsburg.  Nico Schlotterbeck suffered a ligament injury in the match against FC Barcelona. Whether he will be available again in 2024 is currently questionable. pic.twitter.com/jO3WOl1eYT Despite the relief, the club is still in the midst of an injury crisis. Waldemar Anton was injured in the match against Bayern and will likely one or two of the remaining matches in 2024. The club announced on Tuesday that Niklas Sule will be out for a lengthy period of time after his ankle injury was reaggravated in the match against Borussia Monchengladbach. Even reserve defender Filippo Mane will be out for the remainder of the year. Schlotterbeck’s injury now means the club is without center-backs for at least one, likely both, of the remaining matches in 2024. Emre Can will likely pickup minutes as center-back but Sahin will have to get creative when picking his defensive partner. Rami Bensebaini or Felix Nmecha have both played center-back this season, albeit poorly. A lucky individual could also be called up from Borussia Dortmund’s reserve team.

Twice in the game, Dortmund came from behind to equalise with Barcelona and at one point looked like they were even going to win it but a defensive mix-up cost them.  On the performance of the team, Şahin said:  “It’s boiling inside me! It’s boiling inside me, I don’t want to hear that we played well. I want us to win these games. We simply have to win a game like this. That makes me sad.”  The head coach then repeated the message: “I don’t want to hear that we’re playing well. I want to win these games. I want to win. We have to become winners. We didn’t manage that today.” After Dortmund’s poor start to the season, they have managed to build consistency in recent weeks, but several times they have failed to get over the line and earn a result that matches their performance. Against Bayern Munich, they conceded right at the end of the game and had chances to extend their lead. The past weekend, Dortmund were the better team for much of the second half against Borussia Mönchengladbach but again failed to convert their chances. While even against Real Madrid they were the much better side in the first half before they collapsed in the second half. If Dortmund want to be back at the top of the Bundesliga, fighting for the title, then they need to develop a mentality similar to Bayer Leverkusen nowadays where they know that they can win games right at the death, despite maybe not deserving the result.  However, this is an inherent mindset that has been installed in Dortmund for several seasons now, most obviously seen with their loss of the title on the final day in 2022/23 as well as their Champions League final loss last season.

Dortmund were chasing a goal as they trailed Barcelona 3-2 and after winning a free kick in the dying minutes, Schlotterbeck went up for a header, made contact with the ball but landed awkwardly and after the full-time whistle needed a stretcher to help him off of the pitch.  The extent of the 25-year-old’s injury is still unknown, but it is said that it is questionable if he will play again for Dortmund this year. Sky Germany reports that Dortmund hope Schlotterbeck can feature in their final two games of the year, but he should be fit by January.  The injury to Schlotterbeck now means that Dortmund currently do not have any fit centre-backs available as Niklas Süle will miss the next few months with an injury in his ankle while Waldemar Anton has been absent with a torn muscle as well. This means against Hoffenheim on Sunday, Nuri Sahin may have to field Emre Can next to either Pascal Groß, Felix Nmecha or even Ramy Bensebaini.  Schlotterbeck was developing into the leader of Dortmund’s defence in recent weeks as he was not only handed the captain’s armband but also put in performances to back it up. Now, after Dortmund looked like they were finally building consistency, have been thrown into disarray once again. GGFN | Jack Meenan    @2023 - All Rights Reserved. Get Football Group",

There is still time for Leroy Sané to change the perception of his tenure with Bayern Munich, but many fans would see it as unfulfilling after the substantial amount of hype that predated his arrival. Now, there could be an end in sight for his time in Bavaria. Per kicker journalist Georg Holzner, the chances are “slim” for a contract extension between Bayern Munich and the Germany international:  According to @kicker information, the current trend for Leroy #Sané is: His contract will not be renewed. He would need an extreme improvement in performance, according to #fcbayern , in order to increase his - currently slim - chances of getting a new contract.  Sané did score a goal against Mainz 05 during a 2-1 loss on Saturday, but has had middling performances this season overall. At a time where it seems to be clear that at least some players need to move on within the attacking group, Sané could become a prime candidate for the club to let walk away after this season.

Bayern Munich’s acquisition of Harry Kane was fraught with many complications and difficulties. One of the concerns ahead of the transfer was that Kane would simply not find the Bundesliga attractive enough to leave the Premier League, widely regarded as the best league in the world (by some unknown metric nobody bothers to specify).  But, in the end, the transfer happened, with Kane even immediately praising the incredible fan scene of the Bundesliga shortly after his arrival. Nearing the halfway mark of his second season in Bavaria, the former Tottenham Hotspur striker has again decided to give a verdict on the Bundesliga as a whole. “The league is getting better and better, also when you look at how the teams are doing in Europe [and the Champions League],” Kane explains, via @iMiaSanMia. “There are a lot of good teams in there. The top teams try to play in an active way, with possession. It’s impressive. Interest in the Bundesliga in England is growing.” Of course, that last part is likely due to the England captain playing in the Bundesliga.

Bayern Munich is silently becoming a menace at set-pieces, scoring nine goals in the Bundesliga so far this season which is already a league record. Aaron Danks, Vincent Kompany’s assistant, is the brains behind these operations. Max Eberl said that while other clubs do the same, the players that the Bavarians have add a whole new dimension to their play. “Since the beginning of the season, we’ve been trying to think of new ways to do things. Aaron Danks is doing a really outstanding job,” Eberl said (as reported by Bild, captured via Twitter account @iMiaSanMia). “He looks at a lot of things in Europe and tries to adapt things for us. So, this was no coincidence. There are many clubs that are very creative. But you have to add the quality of your own players. You can’t just copy what others do if you don’t have the right players for it.” Arsenal FC got noticed first because that’s all they do: score from set-pieces. For Bayern, that’s what they have in their repertoire of attacking movements.

Well that was something huh. Bayern Munich laughed off suggestions that the German Rekordmeister was once again about to run off with the Bundesliga crown and followed up the season’s best performance — on Tuesday vs. Shakhtar Donetsk — with probably their worst. This 2-0 defeat to Mainz on Saturday can hardly be said to be unlucky. The 05ers scored twice, created more real chances, and stayed more disciplined than the Bavarians who hardly conjured an effort on target outside of Leroy Sané’s too little, too late finish off a Joshua Kimmich deflection. There actually was time for a trademark Bayern comeback, but the energy was not there and the second goal did not arrive. Now Bayern face RB Leipzig to close out the 2024 calendar year.

The injury list has been piling up for Bayern Munich in recent weeks, and it forces the question of whether or not the front office is going to decide to make moves in the Jaunary transfer window or not. Manuel Neuer, Alphonso Davies, and Kingsley Coman are all ruled out until at least the start of 2025, and they are the latest trio of injury concerns on top of Hiroki Ito, Harry Kane, Stanišić, Serge Gnabry and João Palhinha already having been out injured for at least a week by this point. Not to mention, Sven Ulreich has been out indefinitely for undisclosed private reasons. To add to Bayern’s injury concerns, both Sacha Boey and Aleksandar Pavlović have only just marked injury returns for the club. While Bayern is still top of the Bundesliga table and have turned their Champions League fortunes around, the injury problems have still sparked questions as to whether or not they need to invest in reinforcements this winter. Chelsea and Ukraine winger Mykhailo Mudryk has been linked with the Rekordmeister in the past, especially during last winter’s transfer period. At the time, Bayern had him on their radar, but ultimately made the decision to bring forward Bryan Zaragoza’s transfer from Granada that was originally set to take place during the summer window. In hindsight, that might have been the wrong decision based on how little Bryan played under Thomas Tuchel, but Mudryk’s price tag was, and still as, much higher than what Bayern paid for the Spanish winger. After Bayern’s 5-1 Champions League win over Shakhtar Donetsk in Gelsenkirchen, board member for sport Max Eberl was asked by Ukrainian journalists about Bayern’s previous links with Mudryk, who has a contract at Chelsea that runs through 2031. Eberl was quick to downplay the previous links while still not closing the door entirely on it. “He’s an outstanding player. He has a contract at Chelsea until 2031 and costs a lot of money. We are, of course, monitoring the market, of course Mudryk is an outstanding player. But at the moment it’s just a rumor,” he explained, making it diplomatically seem that the Ukrainian international would more than price out Bayern if they were to ever get serious about getting him from Chelsea (via @iMiaSanMia).  Mudryk’s current market value is around €30 million, which is much less than the €60 million Chelsea paid for him when they got him from Shakhtar Donetsk and he has found it rather difficult to get consistent minutes at Stamford Bridge. He has had to try to make his presence felt under four different managers since he’s joined the Blues in Graham Potter, Frank Lampard, Mauricio Pochettino and Enzo Maresca, but it just has not quite clicked for him.  For Bayern, that much of an investment on a player that is not really performing consistently would well and truly be a risky gamble, but it is worth noting that Eberl did not close the door altogether even though he said it is nothing but a rumor.

Report says Florian Wirtz could spurn Bayern Munich in favor of longer stay with Bayer Leverkusen,2024-12-15T21:03:25.000Z,Bavarian Football Works,https://images.fotmob.com/image_resources/news/bavarianfootballworks.png,{'url': 'https://www.bavarianfootballworks.com/2024/12/15/24321638/wirtz-bayern-munich-bayer-leverkusen-real-madrid-manchester-city-fc-barcelona-transfer-rumors-kane'},9823,"Filed under: Will this be a problem for Bayern Munich? According to a report from German outlet kicker, Bayer Leverkusen star Florian Wirtz could opt for a longer stay with Bayer Leverkusen rather than make a move this summer.  This would be bad news for Bayern Munich in particular, but also potentially for Manchester CIty, Real Madrid, and FC Barcelona, who have all been linked with the Germany international. This is what kicker had to say on the matter, which includes details that Bayern Munich cannot afford what is expected to be an exorbitant transfer fee that Bayer Leverkusen would want for Wirtz:  The possibility of Wirtz moving to Munich in the summer of 2025 is considered almost impossible in the industry. Bayern are said to lack the money for a transfer of this magnitude, which would cost 150 million euros plus in transfer fees alone. On top of that, there would be a salary of more than 20 million euros. In addition, the player and Bayer 04 have clearly expressed that they are very interested in working together in the coming season and have assured each other of their mutual appreciation. According to information from kicker, it is also not the case that Wirtz could make his decision dependent on the future of Leverkusen coach Xabi Alonso. One of the reasons many think retaining Wirtz staying with Leverkusen is impossible is because of his expected salary demands, but kicker is reporting that will not be a problem:  And the fact that the deal fails because of the national player’s future salary is out of the question due to the already gigantic revenue from the current Champions League season by Leverkusen standards. Even before reaching the round of 16, which would bring in another ten million euros, the club can already book around 66 million euros in revenue. In addition, Wirtz would initially be satisfied with a significantly lower, but still clearly double-digit million salary in Leverkusen for the maximum one and a half years until a transfer in summer 2026. So it would be a surprise if Wirtz did not extend his contract with Bayer 04 - if he had not already signed the new contract. If true, this could throw a major wrench in Bayern Munich’s offseason planning, which many fans are hoping will include a revamp of the attacking group with players who could better compliment Jamal Musiala and Harry Kane.

Pepsi got a decent backup plan to Musiala.  We all remember some of the famous football-related Pepsi commercials, right? From Real Madrid’s Roberto Carlos getting tricked by a young Manchester United fan to a Western-themed dual with David Beckham dressed as a Cowboy, there was certainly an era where Pepsi was the product the who’s who of celebrities were advertising for.  Of course, they are still a major corporation across the world, and as fate would have it, there is a bit of an ironic connection between the soft drink company, two Bundesliga stars, and the German national team. Pepsi has recently signed a deal with Bayer Leverkusen and Germany star Florian Wirtz as one of the main sponsors of the UEFA Champions League along with Heineken. Wirtz’s new deal with the soft drink mogul starts from January of next year and he will be getting roughly €1m-1.5m from it with bonuses built in based off of how often he promotes their products, predominantly using social media platforms. Similar deals are in place for some of the footballers that haven chosen to take their talents to Saudi Arabia — the Kingdom offers compensation deals for footballers promoting the country on their social media channels. It is absolutely no secret that Wirtz is Bayern’s number one transfer target for the summer transfer window, and the alluring prospect of him playing alongside Jamal Musiala in a Bayern kit is what a lot of fans are clamoring for. They have a unique connection on the pitch playing with Germany, and, in fact, both have a connection to Pepsi.  Per information from Bild (via @iMiaSanMia), Musiala was previously approached by Pepsi for a sponsorship and advertising deal before they wound up going for Wirtz. At the time, Musiala said no to them because he solely wanted to focus on his football with Bayern and Germany. While he originally said no, Musiala is not entirely closed off to entering some sort of deal with Pepsi, or perhaps even another major Champions League sponsor, at some point in the future. For now, though, football is the primary focus and it has shown with his performances on the pitch.  In a perfect, ideal world, by next year, particularly in the late summer or early fall, both Wirtz and Musiala could be part of a package deal with Pepsi, both playing for Bayern by then. Without stepping on the toes of Logan Paul’s PRIME soft drink company, Wirtz and Musiala as the faces of Pepsi could also be massively beneficial for Bayern’s brand visibility on a global market, which is an area the club is already exceptionally good in.

That remains open...for now.  “Everyone knows my situation. For me, this is a very important decision. I know what I have at FC Bayern. My family feels extremely comfortable in Munich. On the other hand, you also have a certain career plan in mind. You have to weigh up what you want and where you want to go,” Kimmich told Bild (as captured by @iMiaSanMia).  Kimmich’s situation is vital to the club, but Wirtz could also hold a massive key to Bayern Munich’s future plans. Will either player take the pitch next September at the Allianz Arena?

   With a pursuit of Bayern Munich star Alphonso Davies looking more and more like a longshot, Real Madrid could be turning its attention to AC Milan’s Theo Hernández: Real Madrid are reportedly exploring new options for a left-back following recent developments with Bayern Munich’s Alphonso Davies. While Davies remains their top priority, Bayern Munich have made efforts to extend his contract, which has caused Madrid to reconsider their options in this position.  As a result, they have revisited the possibility of acquiring Theo Hernandez from AC Milan, reports Calciomercato (h/t SPORT). Hernandez, whose current contract with Milan runs until June 2026, could be available for a transfer next summer if the club fails to secure a renewal. At 27 years old, the French international is in the prime of his career and has been an impressive figure in Serie A. He is widely regarded as one of the best left-backs in Italy and has been a regular part of the French national team setup.  This is a significant moment in his career, where a move to a bigger club like Real Madrid could be the next step. However, Real Madrid may face stiff competition for his signature. Other clubs, such as Manchester United, are reportedly keen on signing Hernandez, especially as they look to rebuild under new manager Ruben Amorim.  The prospect of joining the Premier League, with the added appeal of playing for a team in transition, might make the move even more attractive to the player. Furthermore, Milan is also determined to secure a contract renewal with Hernandez. Should they decide to sell him in the summer, they would demand no less than €50 million for his transfer.  While this price tag could be manageable for Real Madrid, they might still need to explore other alternatives, particularly if they are unable to secure Davies’ services. This situation leaves the Madrid club with the possibility of looking for a different solution to bolster their left-back position ahead of next season.

   Bayern Munich legend Karl-Heinz Rummenigge thinks coach Vincent Kompany has made football fun to watch again in Bavaria. “I’m very satisfied in sporting terms because we have found our way back to a positive culture that is simply fun. I like this high pressing. It reminds me of the times under Jupp Heynckes, Pep Guardiola, Carlo Ancelotti or Hansi Flick, when we celebrated this kind of ‘fun football’. So I think it’s important that we have found our way back to that. Not only has our football become attractive again, but you can also feel the joy of the spectators in the stadium,” Rummenigge said.

Bundesliga matchday 14 saw Bayern Munich’s first defeat of the season going down against FSV Mainz 05. Bo Henriksen and his men pressure forward and packed defense asked questions that went unanswered by the Bavarians. Nearly 70 percent possession for Bayern hardly mattered as they struggled to stitch together any decent chances for most of the game. The sole goal came off of Sane’s run catching a ricocheted ball. Jae-Sung Lee’s brace was enough to see off the game despite a desperate attempt by Bayern to bring back parity in the final minutes.  Henriksen played the anti-Bayern book to perfection with a personal twist added for good measure. A low block, energetic counter attacking and clinical finishing. Mainz were a compact elastic unit that could press very high or park the bus when needed. Driven by Henriksen’s tactics and enthusiasm on the sidelines, the Nullfunfers, as Mainz are also called, converted the pressure and energy into two deserved goals that were enough to send the visitors back empty handed.  Armindo Sieb, the 21 year-old Bayern forward on loan at Mainz put on an excellent display against his parent club. Coming on in the 15 minute for the injured Jonathan Burkardt, Sieb brought agility and pace along with a brilliant eye for picking out dangerous passes. He was involved in the thick of things in both goals, picking up an assist for the second. His connection with his teammates and finesse betrayed his age. The lad looks promising and is a good fit for the way Mainz are playing under Henriksen.  The HurriKane has been out due to injury and his absence is being strongly felt in the squad. Whilst being one of the finest finishers in world football, Kane is also capable of immense creativity when his side needs it. He is known to drop off into a pseudo number 10 role and pick out potent passes in the final third for his teammates. His linkup play with other attackers often gave Bayern the breakthrough against rigid defences. Jamal Musiala and Michael Olise turned out to be the sole channels of attacking breakthroughs on the few occasions when that happened. With only 1 out of 13 shots on target, Bayern’s attack was effectively toothless and an eyesore in the absence of their striker. Kane’s presence so far is irreplaceable in the Bavarian camp.  Bayern Munich faced their first defeat under manager Vincent Kompany. With the winter break fast approaching, the fatigue of the recent match-load has caught up to the Belgian’s squad. Injuries and a slew of mid week games have taken their toll as the Bavarians often looked out of gas against a committed and aggressive Mainz side. With 13 tackles, 27 interceptions and 34 clearances, Mainz effectively locked up the fort and threw the key away.  Bayern finally get a week’s rest before facing RB Leipzig, an important fixture that the Rekordmeister have to win to maintain a healthy lead in the points table. A challenging task against a tough opponent right before the break that will test Kompany and his men’s character come next weekend.

Bayern Munich is never really known for their academy graduates breaking into senior squads. Only recently did it make smart moves and actually developed talent, some of whom are already part of the senior team. Club president Herbert Hainer emphasized this fact. “Aleks Pavlović, for example, was born in Munich, joined FC Bayern at the age of nine, became an international player and increased his market value from 200,000 euros to 50 million within a year,” Hainer said (as captured by X account @iMiaSanMia). “Players like him, Josip Stanišić and also Jamal Musiala, who joined FC Bayern at the age of 16, create identity, they are role models, the next generation after Thomas Müller is growing up here - and that is the path of FC Bayern.” Although Bayern is normally known for shrewd business signing established players, it’s great to see local talent making waves with the big boys.

In the past, the name “Bayern Munich” alone almost seemed enough to secure victory for the Bavarian side. However, Bayern’s 2-1 loss to 1.FSV Mainz 05, paints a completely different story.  A tired and unimaginative Bayern performance was not enough to dispose of Die Nullfünfer, who eventually proved to be the hungrier side. A performance as such may have been enough to earn Die Rekordmeister a victory in the past, however, in today’s Bundesliga, if you are caught napping, you will be punished. Against Mainz, Bayern were the ones who were ultimately punished for a lackadaisical performance, which did not go unnoticed by Germany captain, Joshua Kimmich (as captured @iMiaSanMia). “We saw that we don’t get anything for free. None of the points we got were lucky. We have to continue to be aware that we have to work for everything. We don’t get a win for free, that was clear today. We weren’t good in possession and made a few mistakes. As a result, a lot of things happened around our box. Now everyone has to make sure they’re at an absolute top level on Friday. Leipzig will have to face a very strong Bayern,” said Kimmich. Bayern has already been on the end of a few defeats following some subpar performances this season, and should the same lacklustre team pitch up against RB Leipzig in next weeks decisive final Hinrunde clash, another loss is to be expected. While a loss is never ideal; a loss as a result of a poor performance is a vital lesson for every footballer and football team to learn, especially a juggernaut like Bayern.  One can only hope Bayern can learn from their mistakes and show a strong bounce back next week, just like Kimmich suggested.

Bayern Munich suffered in their Bundesliga clash away at 1. FSV Mainz 05, with the home side producing a spirited performance the Bavarians simply could not keep up with. But, amongst a sea of poor Bayern performances, there were one or two bright spots as well. Here are the match awards from the 2-1 defeat: There were plenty of candidates for this award. Nadiem Amiri showed why he is so important to this Mainz team with an utterly unbelievable performance, eating up any space Bayern had to play through and imposing himself with an incredible 10 ground duels won. Dominik Kohr demonstrated why, even though he seems to genuinely delight in hurting other players, he is simply too good for Mainz to let go. Paul Nebel’s running and hard work off the ball might not have caught the eye but was every bit as important to the team’s victory as the offense was; despite being labeled as more of a technical player, he more than holds his own when it comes to defensive contributions.  But Armindo Sieb is the pick here. Initially coming on as a substitute but delivering an effervescent, energetic display that gave Bayern’s defense fits all afternoon. His “assist” for the first goal may have come fortuitously, but his second was fully acknowledged and the result of a brilliant cross. His overall game was great, too, with the Bayern loanee’s superb hold up play and clinical nature in the final third being attributes which his parent club sorely needed today. Sieb also deserves the award for the dismissive nature Mainz coach Bo Henriksen treats him with, as he was subbed off for the second time this season, despite his good performance, for the second time this season. Just come back, Sieb. They don’t appreciate you enough over there. None of the starters in the defense excelled. The closest was Konrad Laimer, and the midfielder-turned right back deserves credit for his shift at left back, but ultimately his, too, was a performance defined by sloppiness. Like against Borussia Dortmund, however, Sacha Boey injected energy into the squad when he was brought on. His running helped pin defenders back while he won 4 of his 5 duels in his 32 minutes on the pitch. Boey also helped Bayern largely neutralize the offense of Mainz, which had regularly threatened the Bavarians and scored 2 goals before he had entered the field. As Boey starts to regain full fitness, he is demonstrating that it would perhaps be a bit early to write him off right now. To a certain extent, Joshua Kimmich wins this award by default. Neither of his midfield partners managed to excel at all today. But he was one of the only ones putting fires out in midfield for Bayern, while he still completed nearly 100 passes. On a day where the composure of his teammates was shot and the team struggled to put together 5 passes out from the back, Kimmich’s calmness on the ball stuck out positively. He even had a big hand in setting up the sole goal Bayern scored, though it probably helped that he got such a large deflection. He did suffer defensively in some instances, particularly for one of the goals, but no one claims that this was one of his finer performances. Just one that was fine, compared to the mediocrity otherwise present in midfield. Again, there were slim pickings here. Leroy Sané sticks out because he scored the only Bavarian goal of the match. It was not the German’s best performance, not by a long stretch, but in a match devoid of speed or urgency, he was the only one who raised the tempo for Bayern and seemed capable of creating danger without the ball falling to him in the box. Jae-sung Lee deserves the Man of the Match award. Not necessarily for his overall performance, one in which he worked hard but was honestly fairly ordinary, but for his skill and composure in the two crucial moments of the match. His alertness to get on the end of Sieb’s deflected shot and the composure he showed to push it into the net were brilliant, as was the composure to make a 180 turn to evade the attention of Kimmich and stab it past Daniel Peretz. Ultimately, both goals were crucial for Mainz’s eventual victory over the Bavarians and that alone earns him the award.

All signs at the moment point towards Wirtz signing a contract extension at the BayArena. This would then make any more south to the Allianz Arena close to being impossible. On top of this, Wirtz’s future is not linked to the future of head coach Xabi Alonso and has already expressed the desire to continue to play for Leverkusen. It is said that Bayern lack the financial power to afford a transfer of Wirtz which could cost close to €150m on top of a salary that would be close to €20m.  An increase in Wirtz’s salary with a potential contract extension would not be a problem for Leverkusen to afford either. Their participation in the Champions League means that they can afford a low double-digit million salary, ahead of Wirtz likely leaving in 2026. It also cannot be ruled out, kicker says, that Wirtz has already extended his contract at the club. GGFN | Jack Meenan   @2023 - All Rights Reserved. Get Football Group",

Rookie move. Bayern Munich’s injury list has ballooned into absurdity recently, with 8 players out injured at the time of writing. Nor do Bayern expect many of them to be back before the end of the year. With that in mind, Bayern turned their attention to the back-to-back friendlies that the club had scheduled against Greuther Fürth and Red Bull Salzburg during the winter break, realizing that one of these games had to be cut. Here is what Bayern announced via their official website:  FC Bayern have made alterations to their plans for the winter break due to the impact of current injuries on the squad and the need to manage workloads. As a result, the friendly match against Greuther Fürth scheduled for 6 January 2025 will not take place. Tickets already purchased for the game will be automatically and fully refunded by FC Bayern in due course. So it seems the game against the Austrian Cans is still on the table and will be the only friendly Bayern contests this winter, in a repeat of the winter break of 2023. Hopefully Bayern’s return to Bundesliga football in the year will turn out better than it did in 2023.

If you were a young player and you were told that you would be training with the first team, it would be the happiest day of your life. That would spawn “I was doing this when that happened” stories; Jamal Musiala was jogging outside when he received wholly welcome news from Bayern Munich. “I was actually out for a jog in Munich. It was 2020, just before the pandemic”, Musiala recounts (via Players’ Tribune). “I was 17. I had my headphones in, and my phone starts ringing. I thought it was my mum. I pick up the phone mid-run, and it’s [Hermann] Tiger Gerland. He said, ‘I just wanted to let you know that you’re going to train with the first team tomorrow.’ I was so shocked that I actually turned around and ran back home to tell my mum. I ran in the door, and I was just like, ‘Mum!!! Mum!!! You’re not going to believe this!!! We have to eat dinner now. I have to go to bed!’” When you receive news like that, sleeping is near impossible with the excitement and nervousness coursing through you. It can drive you crazy. Speaking of drive, maybe driving lessons can come in handy. To be continued.

Matchday 14 was not kind to Bayern Munich, or perhaps more accurately, Bayern Munich was not kind to itself. A lethargic performance overall, many of the team's players looked uninterested in being on the pitch. Senior members of the squad such as Joshua Kimmich, Leroy Sané, and Kim Min-jae were all a cut below the levels required of them and countless others were misplacing their passes throughout the night. Not ones to pass up a golden opportunity to earn three points, Mainz pounced, using their confidence and ferocity to go head-to-head against the best team in Germany. Captured via the FC Bayern Munich website, Mainz defender Stefan Bell spoke after the match, saying, “It felt really good to be able to celebrate a win and feel that it was deserved. Bayern started better. We reacted tactically during the first half and then became more confident. Then it was a game on equal terms and we took the lead in a good phase.” In contrast to the confidence Bell spoke about Mainz bringing to this match, it was a very different story when the two teams met in the DFB Pokal. Mainz sporting director, Niko Bungert spoke about his side’s change in fortunes, saying, “In contrast to the cup game, it was definitely a completely different team. A team that has developed incredible self-confidence in the last few weeks. We took the right steps. The team and the coaching staff did a great job. We built up a completely different level of sovereignty and brought more and more quality onto the pitch. That was the icing on the cake today, to win against a team like Bayern Munich in the end. The team is simply stable at the moment and can also compensate for losses.”  It was a night to remember for Mainz, but hopefully, Bayern is able to put it behind itself and find form for its upcoming clash with RB Leipzig.

Despite a late pushback by Bayern Munich, courtesy of an 87th minute goal by Leroy Sané, Mainz ran away 2-1 winners thanks to Lee Jae-sung’s brace. The loss to Die Nullfünfer saw Bayern’s six point lead atop the Bundesliga table shrink to just four points (potentially three should Eintracht Frankfurt emerge victorious over RB Leipzig), leaving little room for error in their final match of the Hinrunde against RB Leipzig next week.  In a post match interview with Az’s Patrick Strasser, Joshua Kimmich echoed the message of small margins while ultimately encouraging his side ahead of next week’s must win game (via @iMiaSanMia). “This is now a dangerous but also very decisive moment of the season. All players must internalize that we absolutely have to win the last game of the year on Friday against Leipzig,” said Kimmich. If Bayern want a bit of breathing room ahead of the start of the Rückrunde next year, Kimmich is right. Die Roten, can ill afford to drop points two weeks in a row with title defenders, Bayer Leverkusen, and this season’s Bundesliga surprise package, Eintracht Frankfurt, breathing down their neck.  At this point, it’s anyone’s guess as to which Bayern side rock up against Leipzig next week. The fans will, however, be hoping it’s the free following and free scoring team seen more often than not this season.

It’s some change from the side who struggled to fourth last season, and it’s clear what the difference is: strength in depth. Atlético Madrid have scored more goals from the bench than any other team in Europe’s top five leagues with 10 goals scored, ahead of nine for Lazio and eight for Bayern Munich. Alexander Sørloth showed it again by scoring the winner against Getafe off the bench. At the other end, too, Atleti were able to draw against Getafe because of a pinpoint cross from Nahuel Molina, a second-choice option at right-back who came off the bench and influenced the game. Elsewhere, Robin Le Normand came on for the final few minutes. That’s some upgrade on the likes of Gabriel Paulista as the reserve option last season. In part, it’s down to the strength of the squad in terms of fitness. Luis Piñedo has made a real impact in driving the fitness of the squad, but also of avoiding injuries. Atleti have had less than half of the number of injuries they had last season, and many of those have been impact injuries, like the one which sidelined Le Normand for two, nearly three, months. Not only has there been an upgrade in the quality of players in the squad, but the more used players are available more often as well.   At this point last season (July-December), Atlético Madrid have suffered 20 injuries. This season, they have only suffered 8.@atletico_stats_ pic.twitter.com/nSjnhruKhS Diego Simeone underlined the fact himself in his post-match press conference, reflecting that, “we have repeated the formation several times and there are players who are competing in an extraordinary way, showing what they can do when it’s their turn to come on. Let Llorente and Giuliano come off and Nahuel and Correa come on. Bring on Sorloth for Lino. Let Koke come in. That’s our strength. To compete the way we want to, we have to do it that way”. In 2023/24, only five players (Antoine Griezmann, Álvaro Morata, Ángel Correa, Samuel Lino and Memphis Depay) scored seven goals or more, and 14 different players scored over the course of the season. Already this season Atleti have three (Julián Álvarez, Antoine Griezmann and Alexander Sørloth), and two more are on track to hit that number in the coming weeks and with 13 total goalscorers. That’s without commenting on the case of Samuel Lino, the man who scored eight goals last season and is on only one this year, despite averaging more xG per 90. Much of that comes from some of Atleti’s super subs. Julián Álvarez, who himself grabbed his first goal off the bench, and Antoine Griezmann have established themselves as first choice in attack. Yet all of Ángel Correa’s five goals and two of his three assists have come off the bench, while Alexander Sørloth has got four goals and one assist after coming in. It’s not just goalscorers who are making the difference to Atleti this season, but having reliable and consistent goal-getters coming into the game has been pivotal.  The bench has been crucial to getting points after going behind. Draws against Villarreal, Real Madrid and Rayo Vallecano, and wins against Paris Saint-Germain, Leganés, Alavés and Sevilla, have all seen the opposition take the lead and Atleti come back to claw 12 points in La Liga and three in the Champions League. ""Goals are like ketchup"" Yeah Sorloth is going on a scoring streak in our upcoming games be aware.pic.twitter.com/AHQSrhGVav For the first time since the international break in mid-November, Atlético now have a full seven-day rest period to prepare for their next fixture, the headline clash with FC Barcelona at the Estadio Olimpico Luis Companys next Sunday.  In doing so, it ends a period where Atleti have rarely had more than 72 hours between fixtures for over a month. Diego Simeone exploded after the Champions League win over Slovan Bratislava, saying, “everyone needs to have rest and not play so tight. I’m just saying that because we played on Thursday, on Sunday at 9 p.m. when we had the Champions League and now on Wednesday and then on Sunday at 2 p.m. when we could play at night. But nobody cares.”  But could there also be an argument that such momentum has helped Atlético? It’s allowed Simeone to rotate his key players and rest them, distributing his minutes throughout the squad and keeping his squad options satisfied. Given the low number of injuries with Luis Piñedo as fitness coach, and the team’s impressive record of late goals, tiredness hasn’t hit in yet either. A seven-day break seems a blessing, but it could be of more benefit for Barcelona than it is for Atleti. Gambling Problem? Call 1-800-GAMBLER (1-800-426-2537). Hope is here.

Defender Lenglet of course sealed a fresh departure from Catalunya’s capital this past summer. Deemed surplus to requirements by Hansi Flick and co, the Frenchman went on to pen terms with the aforementioned Atlético, on loan for the duration of the campaign. And, in the time since, Lenglet has gone on to rebuild his reputation in impressive fashion. After a shaky start to life in Spain’s capital, hampered by fitness problems, recent weeks have seen the 29-year-old establish himself as an important figure in Diego Simeone’s backline. All told, Lenglet has been afforded 12 starts across all competitions, chipping in with a pair of goals along the way. And this run of appearances on the part of the one-time Sevilla man is expected to continue next weekend, against his parent club. As per a report from Diario Sport: ‘The truth is that Lenglet will be available for Diego Simeone, as neither Barcelona nor Atlético added any mention of a fear clause in the loan contract that was made official at the end of the last transfer window.’ Conor Laird – GSFN @2023 - All Rights Reserved.

We worked well defensively and we were solid in attack. When you win 4-3, you have to check a lot of things in defence. In the 1-0 win, both the defensive and offensive work is very valuable,” he explained.  “It’s not that I always like to win 1-0; of course I would like, like everyone else, to get better results, but that score has a great significance,” he continued, reinforcing his positivity after the hard-fought three points were secured at the Estadio Riyadh Air Metropolitano. “Before the game, I spoke to the players. I recognised the guys who were not in the line-up. We have repeated the formation several times and there are players who are competing in an extraordinary way, showing what they can do when it’s their turn to come on. Let Llorente and Giuliano come off and Nahuel and Correa come on. Bring on Sorloth for Lino. Let Koke come in. That’s our strength. To compete the way we want to, we have to do it that way. César is less involved; Conor didn’t play, but he’s been doing a great job. That’s the strongest point we have.” “That’s what we need from him. He’s helping us the way he’s helping us, he’s getting involved. We repeated in other games that he had had chances. When you have them, the goals come. It’s a great goal, possibly the most difficult of the last few chances he had. The cross was extraordinary and the header was perfect. It unblocked a match that, as always happens with Getafe, is not easy.” “We have to take it one game at a time. There is no other way. You have to work with humility, try to keep improving, rest and face the match against Barça.” “I always say that, although the focus is on those who are in the line-up, one imagines different situations and possible responses to what can happen. We have those answers, but they depend on commitment. It’s not easy to do that, although it’s nice to say. But it shows when you execute, and we see it. When someone comes in, they give their all, and I’m proud of that.” “I’m representing what I feel. The players know that, I have no commitment to anyone. This is reflected in Koke, a very important man in our journey, who knows that if we need him for 20 minutes, he comes in and he’s a great player in those 20 minutes. That excites me.”

   “I don’t know how you think we’ll approach the game. In the end what will tell if it’s good or bad is the result.” “I am repetitive, boring. I’m not going to change. Until the day I leave, it will be game by game. If we get out of that approach, there is no light.” “That’s a complex question. I always feel that the guys want to give their best, but there are times when it shows and times when it doesn’t. Last year we couldn’t achieve what we wanted to achieve. Last year we couldn’t achieve what we were looking for, and today, fortunately, you can see it in the results.” Gambling Problem? Call 1-800-GAMBLER (1-800-426-2537). Hope is here.

This comes fresh off another outing to remember for the summer arrival in Spain’s capital. Atlético marked their return to action a short time ago, welcoming Getafe to the Wanda Metropolitano for a La Liga clash. When all was said and done, the hosts emerged on the right side of the result, to make it 11 successive victories across all competitions. And it was the aforementioned Sørloth who proved himself match-winner. Midway through the 2nd-half, Nahuel Molina’s pinpoint delivery from the right was nodded home in superb fashion by the towering centre-forward. And, as alluded to above, collective significance in guiding Atléti joint-top of the La Liga table aside, Sørloth’s exploits have since given rise to a head-turning individual statistic. As revealed by StatMuse: ‘Alexander Sørloth is the first player to score 30 non-penalty goals since the start of last LaLiga season.’ Alexander Sørloth is the first player to score 30 non-penalty goals since the start of last LaLiga season. pic.twitter.com/DxhPbglg7I Conor Laird – GSFN @2023 - All Rights Reserved.

For the first time since 2012, Atlético Madrid have posted 11 consecutive wins in all competitions, thanks to a painful 1-0 win against a physical Getafe CF at the Estadio Metropolitano.  In a performance light-years from recent matches, a fatigued Atleti bumbled their way through the first half, although unlucky not to be in front after 45 minutes.  After a slight tinker in formation and a few fresh legs, Los Colchoneros were able to find the goal on 69 minutes when two of the substitutes combined to produce a moment of the highest quality.  Otro salmón para el noruego.        liquida al Getafe.#LALIGAEASPORTS #LaCasaDelFútbol pic.twitter.com/6wZIuwmTlm A quickly-taken free kick was worked out to the right flank where Nahuel Molina, out of favour recently, delivered a pinpoint cross to the head of Alexander Sørloth. The Norwegian wrong-footed Getafe goalkeeper David Soria with a propelled header into the far corner which sent the 60,000 largely Santa hat-wearing fans into a frenzy.  Here are Into the Calderón's three key takeaways from the match. When Koke stood on the sidelines waiting to enter the pitch on 63 minutes, the vast majority of fans watching probably thought the number 8 of Pablo Barrios would appear in red on the fourth official's electronic board. Instead it was Antoine Griezmann's number that flashed up, prompting surprised reactions — not least from the commentators on ESPN+.     Coaches whose players have scored the most goals as substitutes in the history of LaLiga:146 - Diego Simeone119 - Luis Aragones116 - Pellegrini111 - Irureta@pedritonumeros pic.twitter.com/8QAlIlqbJL It turned out, as it often does, to be the right call. Griezmann looked tired and contributed in part to the 77 losses of possession from the team in the first half. Put back into a midfield three for the start of the second half, the Frenchman lacked his usual crisp touch and found it hard to get a hold on the game against a physical opponent. Captain Koke restored a balance to the center of the pitch, and it was his quick thinking that sparked the goal. That goal was a product of two more substitutes. Although with nine ""big chances"" missed to his name in this season's LaLiga, Sørloth's goal came from an xG of just 0.04 - his seventh of the campaign. That slim chance at goal was a result of an excellent cross from Nahuel Molina, who made his first appearance since November 10th, replacing Marcos Llorente on 56 minutes.  Atleti once more showed the depth of players at their disposal, but with a manager that knows who, where and when to apply them. For the second consecutive game, Samu Lino started on the left of the midfield four, due largely to his impressive input against Sevilla. However, the Brazilian, currently with four fewer goal contributions compared to this time last year, spurred two great chances in the first half resulting in his departure from the game.  Julián Alvarez then undertook the job of occupying the left flank in part, although the width was applied more through Javi Galán.

   In matches before Lino's return, it had been Conor Gallagher playing the early days Koke role of being a central midfielder deployed out on the wing. In the return to a 4-4-2 formation, it's the only position where Atleti seem to be lacking an adequate player. Or an in-form one, at least. Rodrigo Riquelme also finds himself in a bad moment, which has seen his playing time reduced as well. This season, Atleti at home can be defined by a single stat. In the first half, they have managed to score four goals in nine matches. In the second half of those games, they have scored triple the amount.   Primeras partes nunca fueron buenas en el Metropolitano. O al menos en LaLiga 24/25...↪️4 goles del 0 al 45'↩️14 goles del 45' al 90'+Tocará tirar deL segundo tiempo una vez más. pic.twitter.com/ltu36hkCsJ We have seen how away from home, Simeone's men have been able to draw up high-scoring wins once that early goal goes in. However, at home, a lack of urgency to take the lead presides.  Fortunately, Simeone’s aggressive changes and willingness to use his entire squad have made the difference after halftime. Los Rojiblancos have been Spain's late show, snatching victory so often after the 75th minute. But should they challenge for trophies, and want to have a squad fit enough to do so, they must assert more authority at home - especially against teams such as Getafe.  Gambling Problem?

Starting XI:  Oblak  Had an easy day on the job, as Getafe were unable to challenge the keeper. Passed the ball with confidence despite some pressing from the opposition. 5 Llorente  Although the Spaniard was unable to burst forward like he usually does, Llorente was a consistent option out wide and underlapping with Giuliano Simeone’s runs. He tracked back to deny the opponent the endline. 5.5  Giménez  Combative as ever, pressuring quickly to the ball whenever Getafe looked to slice a pass through the middle. He made six clearances and five recoveries while committing three fouls in a battling display. 6.5  Lenglet  Cleaned up any loose balls that the defense was able to win back. His five clearances, three tackles, and two blocked shots were important to nullifying Getafe’s attacks. 7  Galán  Pushed forward to contribute overlapping runs out wide and the occasional cross into the box. His movement dragged away defenders and opened lanes for other attackers to exploit. At the back, Galán put in a whopping eight total tackles (winning five) while winning 15 of his 18 ground duels. 7.5  Giuliano Simeone  Created half-chances for Samuel Lino in the 13th minute and Rodrigo de Paul in the 30th minute, had a header of his own blast wide before halftime. Was taken off for Ángel Correa in an attempt to bolster the attack. 6.5  De Paul  Lofted multiple passes into the final third to produce some promising opportunities. In the second half, the midfielder’s pass out wide to Nahuel Molina led to Alexander Sørloth’s finish. 6.5  Barrios  Kept most of his passes simple, helping Atlético Madrid maintain possession. When the opportunity arose, Barrios pushed forward himself in search for a shot on net. 5  Lino  Found himself at the end of two chances in the opening 20 minutes, but sent both of his shots rolling wide of the net. The Brazilian was taken off for Sørloth at halftime. 4.5  Alvarez  Had his first half-chance at the edge of the box saved comfortably by David Soria. Continued to be an option in the buildup play, but was unable to find a shot on goal for the rest of the match. 5  Griezmann  Put in well-placed crosses both in open play and from the corner flag, but was missing an attacker who could rise past Getafe’s stubborn backline. Was subbed off for Koke in the second half to help stabilize the midfield. 5 Subs:  Sørloth  Scored the winning goal with a nice header into the bottom corner on 69 minutes. The striker’s height and physicality were exactly what the team needed to break the deadlock. 7.5  Correa  Won space forward with his dribbling but was unable to find a convincing chance on goal. Picked up a yellow card for arguing with the referee. 4.5  Molina  Came on for Marcos Llorente in the 56th minute. Assisted Sørloth’s goal with a cross from the right-hand side, his first goal contribution since Nov. 3. 7  Koke  After coming on for Antoine Griezmann, the captain looked to maintain some control in what was becoming a chaotic match. Koke was able to add some fresh legs and control over the tempo but he picked up a late yellow card for a tackle on Luis Milla. 4.5  Le Normand The defender replaced Pablo Barrios in the 86th minute. It was good to see the Frenchman get some minutes after his head injury earlier in the season. N/A    Gambling Problem? Call 1-800-GAMBLER (1-800-426-2537). Hope is here.

After defeating Slovan Bratislava on Wednesday, Atlético Madrid (10-5-1, 35 points) have equaled its longest winning streak since October 2013. This run of 10 successive victories has seen Los Colchoneros all but secure a Champions League play-off place and vault into LaLiga’s three-way title race with FC Barcelona and Real Madrid. With another win on Sunday, Atlético will inch closer to its best-ever winning run under Diego Simeone — a stretch of 13 consecutive victories between August and October 2012. Under José Bordalás’ management, Getafe (3-7-6, 16 points) have been as stingy as ever — only 24 total goals have been scored across Los Azulones’ 16 games in LaLiga. Getafe have yet to win away from its Coliseum this season, a drought that began in April; in addition, Geta have an awful 0-4-19 record in league fixtures against Simeone’s Atlético over the past 12 years. Bordalás cannot count on his star midfielder Mauro Arambarri for Sunday’s game, either, as the Uruguayan will be unavailable through suspension. “We have to play a perfect match,” Bordalás told reporters on Saturday. “Atlético have one of the most competitive squads in the competition, they can fight for any and every title. It’s going to be difficult, but we’re confident of playing well.” Simeone was coy Saturday on the potential for rotation against Getafe; he did not train a possible 11 during Saturday’s fog-blanketed training session. Given the coach’s recent complaints about the calendar and the little rest that his players have been afforded, a few changes seem likely for Getafe’s visit, starting with Nahuel Molina entering the side in place of Marcos Llorente. Molina has not played for his club in nearly a month due to injury, not to mention Llorente’s excellent form of late.  ⚽️ Tremenda, la niebla que hay hoy en el entrenamiento del #Atleti.  Simeone tiene a todos sus futbolistas listos. Sin lesiones. pic.twitter.com/MbUCKh5qzc Ángel Correa did not play a part in Wednesday’s 3-1 win over Slovan and should have some role to play against Getafe, but El Cholo will be loathe to break up the Antoine Griezmann - Julián Alvarez duo in attack. Since Oct. 31, the Griezmann-Alvarez partnership has been Europe’s most lethal, with 15 goals scored between them; that is two more than Barcelona’s Raphinha-Robert Lewandowski duo, and four more than Real Madrid’s Vinícius Júnior-Jude Bellingham pair and Bayern Munich’s star attackers Harry Kane and Jamal Musiala. ¡Los convocados para el #AtletiGetafe!    pic.twitter.com/WEcxRo9RTS Date Dec. 15, 2024 Location Riyadh Air Metropolitano, Madrid Kickoff time 2:00 p.m. CEST, 1:00 p.m. GMT, 8:00 a.m. ET, 5:00 a.m. PT Available TV/streaming ESPN+ (United States), Movistar+ (Spain) Gambling Problem?

I always expect more from him, just as he expects more from me and I hope he continues in the same way.” “Little by little they have been growing from the connection, the understanding, every day they progress in that partnership that is being generated and when Correa or Sorloth come on, the team is fed with other characteristics. We need everyone. We have four very important strikers, we need the best from each one of them and we need them to play at all times.” “Robin is an extraordinary defender, coming from a serious injury where his teammates (have been) competing in the best way. He is noble and works to have the opportunity to help. He is very strong in his temperament. It will be his turn. We need everyone. Especially from a player like him, who is one of the most important defenders we have.” “He’s an important player in the squad, possibly the one we’ve been talking about the most during this time. We need all the ability he has, between his speed, striking, work, humility, effort to work within the team. He will have to live with what football and society has, which is criticism. In my opinion it will make him stronger and the people around him will help him every day.”

   “I’ve always seen them as a very competitive team that has a clear idea of how to play. The coach’s imprint has allowed them to be where they are and we can’t imagine a match (other than one) with difficulties, competitive in the game on the pitch. They play in a specific way and do it well. They have a coach with very clear ideas.” “We’re analysing what’s best for tomorrow’s game and we’ll see what we’ll do.” “The only way to take care of things is to generate work, humility and commitment. From that and in that game a lot of things can happen.” Gambling Problem? Call 1-800-GAMBLER (1-800-426-2537). Hope is here. GamblingHelpLineMA.org or call (800) 327-5050 for 24/7 support (MA).

A new report in Marca states that Atlético Madrid are not contemplating the loan or sale of Rodrigo Riquelme, despite the player’s struggle for minutes and his poor form — which has prompted unfortunate abuse on social media. The Madrid daily reports that Atlético continue to consider Riquelme, 24, a “foundational player” for the future, even though his 629 minutes are the third-fewest among the squad’s outfield players. Riquelme’s humility has made him popular in the dressing room, and he continues to “dream” of succeeding at Atleti — the “club of his life”, which he joined in 2010 after spells in Zaragoza and Rayo Vallecano’s youth teams.     JUST IN: Rodrigo Riquelme is UNTOUCHABLE.The club has no plans to let him go and believes he should be one of the club’s foundational players for the future.Despite the abuse he’s been receiving recently, he still dreams of succeeding at the club of his life, Atlético… pic.twitter.com/VVbl1qh0wu Riquelme convinced Diego Simeone of his qualities following productive loan spells at Mirandés (2021/22) and Girona (2022/23) — fearless dribbling, strong ball-carrying, and an eye for goal. His first season in the Atlético first team was solid: he started 17 of his 34 appearances in LaLiga, with a return of 3 goals and 5 assists across 1,528 minutes, often while playing as a left wing-back.  But Riquelme was not a natural at the position, and as Atlético have switched formations from the 3-5-2 back to the 4-4-2, Roro has found himself on the fringes of the first team — only Thomas Lemar and César Azpilicueta have played less, mainly due to extended injury absences. Riquelme this season has yet to score or assist a goal across 16 appearances in all competitions. He has played only 404 minutes in LaLiga and has been an unused substitute six times already; Simeone has tried him again at wing-back, in addition to playing him as a winger either side of a central midfield pair, but he has not found a home at any one position.  Making matters worse for Riquelme is the fact that Samuel Lino, his main competition for minutes, is finding form after his own slow start to 2024/25. Lino has one goal (an absolute belter against Sevilla) and three assists from his past five games.  ❤️  pic.twitter.com/kA1A4aeEop Personally — and I have been proven wrong before — I would hardly call Riquelme a pillar for the future, and (if accurate) the club’s strong stance over the player is a bit befuddling. There is no doubt that Roro is a talented player with room yet to grow, but in his case, his versatility is a curse rather than a blessing; he lacks the composure and decision-making to play the game at its highest levels; and he turns 25 in four months, rendering it an open question as to how much more there really is to his game. He was linked with a move to Roma over the summer, as well as a potential return to Girona; one wonders if the smart choice may have been to sell high, for €20 million or so, and call it a day. Still, there are underlying metrics in Riquelme’s favor as he fights his way back into contention for minutes. He leads all Atlético players in shot-creating actions per 90 minutes (4.22), progressive carries per 90 (7.78), carries into the final third (4), and carries into the penalty area (1.78). However, he is possibly the team’s worst dribbler given volume (4 attempts/90) and success rate (0.89 per 90, around 22 percent) — and despite being an aggressive shooter (2.45 attempts p90), his shot selection is poor, leaving him with a low 0.15 xG/90 mark.

As shown in the infographic, each team is limited to just two possible opponents. For example, the ninth- and tenth-seeded teams can only face the twenty-third or twenty-fourth seeds, and so on for all positions. From this point forward, there will be no random draws; the matchups will follow a guided table. In the round of 16, however, teams will again be drawn, with matchups determined by each team’s position in the standings. It’s important to note that in both the round of 32 and the round of 16, the higher-seeded team will have home advantage. However, from the quarterfinals onward, home advantage will be determined by a draw. Based on the current standings, here are the potential matchups for the round of 32: -9th/10th vs. 23rd/24th: Borussia Dortmund or Bayern Munich vs. PSV Eindhoven or Dinamo Zagreb -11º/12º vs. 21st/22nd: Atlético de Madrid or AC Milan vs. Celtic or Manchester City -13º/14º vs. 19th/20th: Atalanta or Juventus vs. Club Brugge or Real Madrid -15º/16º vs. 17th/18th: Benfica or Monaco vs. Sporting CP or Feyenoord In this scenario, Real Madrid could face one of two Italian teams: Atalanta, whom they already defeated on matchday 6, or Juventus, with the second leg to be played away from the Santiago Bernabéu. Meanwhile, Atlético de Madrid would be matched against either Celtic or Manchester City, with the return leg played at home. These matchups will also shape the round of 16, as the winners of these ties will go on to face the top eight teams from the league phase. Each of the top eight teams will know their opponents once the round of 32 concludes. If Real Madrid win their round of 32 tie (against either Atalanta or Juventus), they would face Arsenal or Bayer Leverkusen in the round of 16. Similarly, if Atlético de Madrid advance (past either Celtic or Manchester City), they would meet Aston Villa or Inter, with the second leg played away from home. -1st/2nd vs. winner of 15th/16th vs. 17th/18th: Liverpool or Barcelona against the winners of Benfica/Monaco - Sporting CP/Feyenoord -3rd/4th vs. winner of 13th/14th vs. 19th/20th: Arsenal or Bayer Leverkusen against the winners of Atalanta/Juventus - Club Brugge/Real Madrid -5th/6th vs. winner of 11th/12th vs. 21st/22nd: Aston Villa or Inter Milan against the winners of Atlético de Madrid/ AC Milan - Celtic/Manchester City -7th/8th vs. winner of 9th/10th vs. 23rd/24th: Brest or Lille against the winners of Borussia Dortmund/Bayern Munich - PSV/Dinamo Zagreb USMNT Champions League Finally, Barça, the other Spanish team and the only one in the Top-8, would face one of the two winners of the knockout stages, which would face Benfica or Monaco and Sporting or Feyenoord.

That led to questions for Atleti coach Simeone, pushing him on whether he believes the title could be a possibility this year. “Dreaming big means dreaming about the next match, going game by game,” he responded, when asked about Weiss’ comments.

   Simeone went on to add, “we know that it is a league with Real Madrid and Barcelona, the best teams in Europe, in the cup you will surely cross them if you keep advancing, in an important moment in the Champions League too, in the league we always compete against them and they are the best. We play against two very good teams in La Liga itself.” “I am satisfied with the team’s work, we came from a very big effort, three matches in six days and the response was very good in all the matches. In the end we lacked that freshness that we would have had with a little more rest. There are two games left, they are very good teams, we face Leverkusen, one of the best in the competition and we will see how far we can go, we will give our maximum and whatever the sum of points brings us.” “Today’s game was important for us, to get points for all the effort we have been making and to continue in the dynamic it was very important to win today. The effort was what we saw, the first half was controlled, with important chances and then in the second half it was controlled beyond that penalty that can generate difficulties due to the closeness of the result, but the players managed it well and we won a match that was very important for us to get the three points.” “Rodrigo, the first day we thought about him we knew of his hierarchy, he has shown it in the Argentine national team, in Atleti with good moments and others to improve and he is having a tremendously important consistency, because he sees differently, has a last pass, a goal in his shot and works, when a player has these characteristics he makes us better as a team.” “It is football and football turns, it changes, with moments of difficulty and others that lead you to be very good. We know what we have, where we are going and we try to improve.” “Everyone needs to have rest and not play so tight. I’m just saying that because we played on Thursday, on Sunday at 9 p.m. when we had the Champions League and now on Wednesday and then on Sunday at 2 p.m. when we could play at night. But nobody cares, the results matter and if they play badly and don’t run there is no criticism and if they play well nothing is said.” “I don’t want to give them points, I’m talking about the team’s awareness of what happens in the game. Against Cacereño it cost us, against Vic too, against Paris we had to suffer and all the matches have been different and the team is responding to the situations we find in a match.” “I think that if the coach chose to put the player, he did not think about putting his son on the field. Like me, neither of us looked at them as a son, we looked at them as a footballer.” Gambling Problem? Call 1-800-GAMBLER (1-800-426-2537). Hope is here.

Atletico won a 10th game in succession across all competitions as they eased past Slovan Bratislava 3-1 at home on Wednesday, a result that leaves them one point outside the top eight with games against Bayer Leverkusen and Salzburg still to come.

""The players managed it well, and we won a game in which we cared a lot about the three points."" Atletico have been magnificent on their 10-game winning run, scoring 30 goals in that streak, effectively putting their sluggish start to the campaign behind them. ""It's football and football turns, changes, with moments of difficulty and others that lead you to be very good.

Atlético Madrid recorded a 10th straight victory, beating Slovakian giants Slovan Bratislava 3-1 at the Riyadh Air Metropolitano on Wednesday night. A first-half belter from Julián Álvarez and an Antoine Griezmann brace either side of half-time gives Los Colchoneros an all-but-confirmed place in the Champions League playoff places with a top-eight finish very much in view. Atlético never had to leave third gear, with midfielders Rodrigo De Paul, Pablo Barrios and Koke (in the second half) demonstrating a masterclass in how to control a game of football. Los Colchoneros were able to continue their stunning goalscoring run, having netted 30 goals in this ten-game run. This can be largely attributed to the fine connection between midfield and attack as shown once again on Wednesday. Álvarez and Griezmann's one-touch sequences further prove the construction of a partnership that could be very fruitful in the remainder of this season.   ⚪️ For the first time in the Diego Simeone era, Atlético Madrid has scored (and won) 3 or more goals in 5 consecutive games.The last time this happened in the club’s history was back in the 1950s.[via @Atleti_life/@ChampionsLeague] pic.twitter.com/j1sfRjqIQJ Player Ratings Jan Oblak 6: Appeared when needed to deny any hope the Slovakians had of staging a late comeback. Made himself big to get enough of an ankle on the ball to divert it onto the near post. Guessed the wrong way on the penalty. Marcos Llorente 7: Active as ever down the full length of the right-hand side. With his improvised, volleyed, looping cross to Griezmann, he registered his sixth assist of the season and could have had another should Lino have been more clinical in the first half. Marcos Llorente has 4 assists this UCL campaign.No other player has more. pic.twitter.com/vyUUeRVjHe José María Giménez 6: Atleti's very own marshall maintained a sense of calm at the back for the majority of the game. Was unlucky to see his header flash the wrong side of the post late in the second half. Clément Lenglet 6: Was extremely unfortunate to concede a penalty resulting in Slovan Bratislava’s goal in what was an otherwise solid performance from the Frenchman. Something we are becoming accustomed to in recent weeks.  Javi Galán 7: Involved in much of the attacking build-up down the left-hand side. A misplaced header led to a rare Slovan Bratislava chance in the first half. Another match to consolidate his place in the team further. Giuliano Simeone 6: El Cholito has been quieter in terms of contribution to goals since Llorente’s reintroduction to the team, but his work rate and garra remains invaluable to his father’s side.  Rodrigo De Paul 10: One insightful pass after another flowed off the boot of El Motorcito, appearing to make something happen every time he had the ball at his feet. He continues to be Atleti's most important player in recent weeks. Pablo Barrios (subbed off 45’) 7: Sat deep to sweep up any loose balls and kept the play moving before being deservedly rested for the second half of the match. His ball for Llorente in the build up of Atleti’s second goal was reminiscent of Tiago’s at Stamford Bridge in 2014.  Samu Lino (73’) 5: Notched his third goal contribution in the last two games but still appears to have had his superpowers drained from him that he possessed in the 2023-24 season. Antoine Griezmann (73’) 9: El Principito continues his dazzling run of form, scoring for the fifth consecutive game. The Frenchman's double takes him to 40 career Champions League goals. Julián Álvarez (73’) 8: With perhaps his best strike to date in red and white, the Argentinian noted his fourth goal in the Champions League this season. The seemingly unconnected figure from the start of the season is a thing of the past. His link-up play with teammates was near-on flawless. Koke (45’) 8: Had a minimally-taxing second half in the quarterback role, demonstrating the full range of his passing abilities, including a deceptive ball through for Griezmann’s second. What a player to have to bring off the bench, eh? Conor Gallagher (73’) 5: Another game of banding about between opposition players in a left-sided position that he doesn’t seem to look all too comfortable in, yet he hasn’t put a foot wrong. Alexander Sørloth (73’) 5: Contributed little to nothing on the ball, brought on to bully the Slovan defence into a sustained tiredness. Rodrigo Riquelme (73’) 6: A lively cameo from Roro down the left that (still) lacked a goal or assist to put him back in contention for a place in the starting lineup. Gambling Problem?

This comes owing to his exploits in Atlético’s meeting with Slovan Bratislava. Diego Simeone’s troops marked their return to action a short time ago, welcoming Slovakian giants Slovan to Spain’s capital for a Champions League clash. When all was said and done, the Rojiblancos proved too much for the visitors, emerging on the right side of an eventual 3-1 result. And the aforementioned Antoine Griezmann proved himself the star of the show. Fresh off a match-winning brace over the weekend, the Frenchman was at the double once more this evening, adding to Julián Alvarez’s early opener either side of the interval. And, as alluded to above, in the process, Griezmann joined Lionel Messi and Mohamed Salah in an altogether noteworthy individual club. As revealed by statisticians Opta: ‘Antoine Griezmann has scored 36 goals in 79 appearances for Atlético Madrid in the Champions League, all under Diego Pablo Simeone.

He admitted that the Rossoneri lacked the extra edge to win.  Leao played from start to the left and had a decent game, often beating his man and creating chances for Milan. However, like his teammates, the final touch wasn’t always brilliant and that is what helped the Rossoneri back this season. Speaking to MilanTV after the game, as cited by MilanPress, Leao discussed what went wrong and highlighted that Milan lacked ‘viciousness’. He also praised Alex Jimenez, who was the starting left-back and was named the MOTM by us. On what was missing… “We lacked viciousness. Even if we didn’t play a perfect or beautiful game, we had our chances. We weren’t lucky, even with that crossbar. It was a game to give something to the fans, but now we’re holding our heads high and moving forward.” On Jimenez… “He’s a good guy with quality. Today he showed us what he can give to the team. I’m very happy for him and I always try, as a veteran, to give confidence to the younger ones, because they are the future of Milan.” Milan will be up against Hellas Verona next, with that game scheduled for Friday evening, and it remains to be seen what the support of the fans will be like. After tonight’s clash, they made their thoughts clear. If Emerson and Chukwueze more aggressive, I think milan will be win. Lots of space in their side but they play like inferior, fear to cut inside Genoa penalty box. I think saladmakers more useful than chukwueze. He can be right back / right wing… Your email address will not be published.

Patrick Vieira’s side put on a resilient defensive performance at Stadio San Siro, fending off Paulo Fonseca’s experimental line-up in one of the most uneventful fixtures in recent Serie A memory.  Fonseca left Theo Hernandez on the bench and handed 17-year-old Mattia Liberali his maiden league start for the senior team. However, his tactical alterations backfired as Milan failed to create much in the final third despite enjoying 57% possession and unleashing 22 attempts on goal. Stats could be deceiving, and that was the case tonight. Apart from Tammy Abraham’s poor finish and Samuel Chukwueze’s wayward half-volley, Milan didn’t do anything noteworthy in the first half. Alvaro Morata took the English striker’s place at the beginning of the second half, only to cost his side what would’ve been three precious points. Emerson Royal forced an incredible diving save from Nicola Leali only a minute after the break. However, it took Milan almost half an hour of sustained pressure to muster their next goalscoring chance. Morata sold one of Genoa’s defenders a dummy but fluffed his lines from a promising position. Three minutes after squandering his first chance, the Spaniard blew Milan’s best scoring opportunity of the night. Tijjani Reijnders teed him up with an inch-perfect ball, but Morata inexplicably hit the crossbar from only a few yards out. Another disappointing result left Milan a substantial eight points adrift of the top four. Let’s look at our player ratings.  Mike Maignan – 6 Genoa’s defensive-minded approach made the Frenchman a marginal figure. He didn’t have to make a save but had to stay focused to clear Malick Thiaw’s catastrophic back pass off the line. Emerson Royal – 7 Had it not been for Leali’s stunning stop, he would’ve opened his Milan account. Despite failing to offer depth on the wing, the Brazilianpulled off numerous no-nonsense clearances at the back.   Matteo Gabbia – 7 In addition to making light work of Andrea Pinamonti and slamming the door shut at the back, the experienced defender emerged as a deep-lying playmaker, producing several pinpoint diagonal balls. Malick Thiaw – 6.5 The German could’ve undone all the good work in one second but had Maignan’s awareness to thank for not scoring a bizarre own goal at the final stretch. Alejandro Jimenez – 7 Barring sporadic lapses of concentration, the Spanish youngster proved a decent backup for Hernandez, completing a number of progressive runs and even firing a decent long-range effort late in the first half. Youssouf Fofana – 6.5 The Frenchman was more courageous in the opposition’s half for a change, yet he must think and distribute the ball much faster. Tijjani Reijnders – 7.5 It was disheartening to see this midfield powerhouse waste his talent alongside a disorganized Milan squad. Absolute masterclass!  Rafael Leao – 6 For a player wearing the captain’s armband on the club’s anniversary, the Portuguese winger failed to rise to the occasion, delivering a lackluster performance. Mattia Liberali – 5.5 Despite showing glimpses of his potential, the Milan teenager often surrendered possession way too easily.  Samuel Chukwueze – 4 Blazing the ball into the stands from point-blank range perhaps best illustrates the Norwegian’s erratic evening. Out-of-sorts! Tammy Abraham – 3.5 It’s unacceptable for a Milan striker to be this wasteful in the box. Subbed off during the break for another injury concern. Alvaro Morata – 4 Francesco Camarda – 4.5 Noah Okafor – 3 Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked * Comment *  Name *  Email *  Website

According to a report, there is a reason why they displayed it outside the stadium.  As the club celebrated its 125th anniversary today, even if the actual day is tomorrow (December 16), the fact that Milan are nowhere near ‘the good old days’ has been top of mind. And after the game finished 0-0, due to a lacklustre display, the fans made themselves heard. After exiting the stadium, the Curva Sud displayed a banner with some well-chosen words for the management: “Milan management: we have waited for you and supported you endlessly, we have had enough of your mediocrity. Incompetent managers, a club without ambition. You are not up to our history,” the banner read. According to various outlets, including the journalist Antonio Belloni, the Curva Sud displayed the banner outside the stadium because it wasn’t allowed inside. In other words, they couldn’t get it approved by the Milan management. Striscione fuori lo stadio: “Società Milan: vi abbiamo aspettato e sostenuto a oltranza, della vostra mediocrità ne abbiamo abbastanza” pic.twitter.com/KMq2OMF9QK — Antonio Vitiello (@AntoVitiello) December 15, 2024 I don’t know who has had what, but I have definitely had enough of Fonseca and his mediocrity! Fonseca is not your problem but the management, they saw other good coaches before they decided to hire him.
From Gary Cardinale to the last person in the Milan hierarchy are brainless and useless including ibrahimovic. Uh Fonseca was chosen by the management. The same management that build this horibble team. I think its time to stop blaming the coaches. Correct. Lazy useless management has moved us backwards from a promising project that was working. We’d won a scidetto with one if the youngest teams in the league. And then they ruined it. Cheap buys, lazy plans, selling starters, horrible appointments. Imbeciles up top tore apart what promise we had Team is terrible and I think for the money spend they could have purchased some young talent from S.America like Benfika, Sporting in general portugese clubs do…its clear that Milan has no 100 milion for one or two players. Problem is that scouting before mercato is a desaster. No coach in the world can make winning team out of
 this squad. This ownership will not bring Milan to anything glorious. Well played….. Gerry
He knew what’s up haha 😅 And het He Garry can’t pay back the loan and still asking for another 3yrs extension to ruin the club more before they finally take it from him and we go back building from scratch F@ck RedTurd New Management  and manger are now urgently required to salvage this sinking ship. Don’t understand what they are waiting for to take immediate action. Either way management  failed miserablely and now it shows how great was Paolo Maldini.  The Curva Sud supporters are correct but unfortunately management is not only deaf but blind too. See how bad these Milan management people are?!?
Have censorship on the supportive fans, who are always cheering for our team. Somebody at Milan needs to do a temperature check. This thing looks like it’s about to completely derail.  Milan legends in attendance probably laughing at Ibra & co.  What a sh*tshow this has become. Amateur hour. Completely embarrassing for ibra, moncada, furlani and redturd. Horrible built squad, bad coach and amatour management. Hope cardinale loses it to elliot. Curva sud should and the rest should boycott every game.  Management do not know how to build a winning squad. The faster cardinale sells thee better off we will be. In every aspect of life once American are involved, consider that thing as shambolic. Very useless management. Maldini and Boban left as a result of selling Sandro Tonali and they left alongside the glory. Your email address will not be published.

Milan’s 125th anniversary celebrations fell rather flat as they played out a disappointing 0-0 draw against Genoa at San Siro. The team created very little and looked slow throughout, then what they did create was wasted, mostly by Alvaro Morata. The worry now is that the Rossoneri continue to gain no ground on the teams above them and the Champions League places remain out of reach with such inconsistent form. In fact, Milan have even dropped into eighth after Bologna beat Fiorentina earlier today. Fonseca spoke to DAZN after the full-time whistle to try and assess what was a difficult night for his team that ended with more jeers, and MilanNews relayed his comments. How do you feel after the game? “I think we played a good game, we created a lot, the players had the desire to win, they played as a team and all that was missing was the goal. And obviously the quality in the final decisions was missing, the whole time we were in the opponent’s area. I think we had 22 shots, all that was missing was a goal.”

‘We are not Americans’ – Milan squad jeered off field as fans make anger known

  Is there also a lack of conviction and being clinical? “Not today. Today the team wanted to win the match, we were aggressive without the ball and we arrived close to Genoa’s area many times. I think it’s not a question of confidence but of choices.” Milan create a lot but the impression is that they lack a real centre-forward… “I think we have some good attackers. Abraham had a contusion, Alvaro didn’t train all week. I think sometimes we talk about attackers, but our game also lacked quality in crossing, shooting, assists. But I have total faith in our attackers.” The fans protested at the end of the game… “It’s normal, this happens. We really wanted to win for our fans but I feel that they have always been with the team. And I think we can all see that the team gave everything to win, clearly we are not satisfied with the result and I understand the disappointment of the fans.” Alvaro didn’t train all week and yet you played him hahahah this is a joke But hey he is not to blame. Mediocre coach, mediocre results. HP!!!!!!! 🤡🇵🇹 🤬H1j0 D……!!!! 🤡🇵🇹🤮 Oh just f*&# off already you brainless fool of a coach. 8th and this Portuguese Giampaolo still in charge? Man this management clearly lacks both vision and balls. Bye bye scudetto.  Hope we can fight and qualify for UCL. Bring back Tonali and buy star player for FW position and speed right wing. We cannot rely on chuwameki and Morata no longer on his best form. Last game we won, he blasted on the players and Captain, and made public rant. This game he replaced with players he thinks are good, and tie (and without even a goal), and said “played a good game”.
What is he trying to fool other people..! He is THE worst I have seen.. Was Fonseca watching the same game as the rest of us ?. Genoa and the rest of the bottom feeders are licking their chops to play us. Wait until Leao,Theo,Maitland demand to leave, two years from a Scudetto and one year from second place and now making the top 8 is up for discussion. Terrible ownership. The more i see milan play, the more i am put off – no urgency, hundreds of back passes that lead nowhere, confusion all over, lack of power up front …..
CLEARLY IT IS ALREADY TOO LATE TO SACK FONSECA ….. WE ARE IN A TERRIBLE MESS WITH NO HOPE AT ALL FOR THIS SEASON.
IBRA’S SWAGGER TOO IS OFFPUTTING and he too is responsible for this huge mess. My wish for 2025 – that ibra, furlani, moncada and cardinale rot in hell and make way. Honestly Fonseca is not making a good case for himself, he should not have taken Abraham off, he was more lively and is in better form, he and Leao play better together, he waited to long to bring in Okafor, despite the fact Chukweze was simply out of sorts, are critical analysis has to be made on the people in the club who made the deal to bring Chukweze to the club.
Jimenez is a very good player, but he is not a left back or even a right back, with his talent, skill and movement, he would be better as a winger, his physical qualities are not suited for a defender, he should be used on the right wing, he is similar to Salemeaker.
This situation needs to be properly handled, and the Coach needs to also critically look at himself. The so called Fonseca is just like Ten Hag, always giving the opinion of “we played well”. The moment I noticed these management refused Jonathan David and instead signed Morata/ Abraham, the moment they sold Tonali,the moment they signed Emerson Royal,I know they’re clueless.

Milan’s 125th anniversary celebrations were not marked with a win as they were held to a disappointing 0-0 draw against Genoa at San Siro in which the team created very little and looked lethargic throughout. The result means that the Rossoneri have not taken any strides towards the Champions League places and have actually dropped to eighth place in the table after Bologna’s win earlier today, a dire situation the fans are well aware of. As the video below shows and as MilanNews report, the fans let rip with boos and jeers at full-time, and then there were two rather strong chants. The first was “ci avete rotto il cazzo (you’ve p*ssed us off) and “Noi non siamo americani (we are not Americans)”. 😳 Fans jeered the team off the field and chants of ‘We are not Americans’ could be heard pic.twitter.com/AxgA1tDGoO — SempreMilanTV (@SempreMilanTV) December 15, 2024 I hope after this game all the legends can sit around the table with the management and discuss the issues and solutions to this Milan.  I can’t see a single drop of great Rossoneri blood in any of the senior players Legends sit around the table with management? You want Gerry to fire them too? lol 🤣 Hahahaha 😂😂😂 Lol Gery dont even knows who are Milan legends. CARDINALE COBARDE!!! NO ESTUVO ZLATAN UN EGOLATRA TORPE Y FONSECA UN MEDIOCRE 🤮🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🇵🇹🇺🇲 Very mediocre performance and no fighting spirit like even Bologna players have more wits than milan players,  the management got it wrong big time, the players ain’t sync but still ForzaMilan Many were happy to see Fonseca tear apart the dressing room with his experiment! I said it yesterday that this man has finally lost the dressing room! This man was never a winner and can never win! A winner does not have to spend a decade before he wins! Mourinho took just 2years at porto, the rest was history, Ancelloti winning mentality was spotted at Parma, the rest was history, Guardiola was a genius even at Barcelona B before he was entrusted with team A, Someone inzaghi took just 2 years at Lazio, Mancini, Allegri etcetera….The choice of Fonseca was always going to be a disaster to happen! The coach is a reflection of management as the management is a reflection of owners! We can never compare the management of Elliot to Redbird….the former had Gazidis, Maldini and massara-won a scudetto,UCL semifinal & balance the book…the latter is playing catch up with ZLATAN- Moncada and Furlani what a failure! And already in 8th position… relegation here we come I wonder if fans and media in other leagues have so many issues with foreign owners, especially when their investors or corporations are not capable of buying or, for that matter, holding on to these clubs.
EPL became the best league in Europe because of the influx of foreign ownership.
When this owner sells the club, another foreign owner will come and buy it. Then it will be we are not Arabic or not Chinese.
How about instead of being xenophobic, get around, put your money together, buy back these clubs that you can’t wait to sell to foreign investors, and then tell us what you are or aren’t.
Everything else is just empty rhetoric.
Get your money up. Miss the point harder, buddy He is prob american, reason is not their strong side lol. Good grief…. Haha exactly what I was about to say…guy doesn’t understand anything!! Always have to make it about race or something like that when in this case has absolutely nothing to do with what happened… It’s very straight forward unless you refuse to understand.
Xenophobia is the fear or hatred of strangers, foreigners, or anything that is strange or foreign. The word comes from the Greek words xenos, which means “stranger” or “guest”, and phobos, which means “fear” or “flight”. 
The fans were saying: Noi non siamo americani (we are not Americans)”. Very straight forward. No point to miss here.
You are confusing yourself with racism which is a totally different issue.
Stop selling your clubs to foreign owners and then complain that they are foreign.
Berlusconi sold Milan to a foreign owner that had less money than any of the people singing these chants. It wasn’t me that sold it.
Half of the league is owned by foreign owners. Domestic owners only cared about selling to the highest bidder instead of to another domestic owner. Berlusconi, Moratti, Sensi, etc.
Get your money up, buy your clubs back or shut up. Its not tho, they dont care where people are from just dont force your ways on them in their country. Nothing wrong about being a proud italian in italy. At this point only Maldini can save us if he manages to find new investors to buy the club. What are you talking about. maldini did a pretty bad job, all the work Ivan Gazidis did for nothing. Maldini did mistakes but he was also new at the job and gave us CL semi final and a Scudetto. Look where we are now. Maldini was ambitious and was always pushing Elliot for more. He did a pretty great job in my opinion. In what foreign country is he trying to find these investors to save Milan? Oh wow I thought Maldini was the problem. Hmm 🤭🤭 125th anniversary and Gerry is nowhere to be seen. Shows how much our owners care. Berlusconi would rarely miss a match and he was worth 10x the amount Gerry is. If our season is getting derailed it all starts with Gerry. Best part about it is he will probably end up losing control of milan like Li or will sell so he doesn’t lose his assets.. At least the curva spoke up because this is getting out of hand.

With more composure in front of goal, the Rossoneri would have clinched all of the points and below are the player ratings.  If you haven’t already, make sure to check out how we decide the player ratings. From the scale to what affects the rating, we have compiled everything there. Maignan (6): He didn’t have much to do today, in fact Genoa had zero shots on target, but based on his passing and assertiveness on set pieces he gets a pass. Emerson Royal (6): The Brazilian was very unlucky not to open the scoring for Milan as the goalkeeper made a brilliant save to deny his header. His crossing wasn’t always the best tonight, but defensively he was sound and he was certainly not the problem in this game. Gabbia (6): Solid defending all-round, as showcased by the blocks at the end (even if the referee awarded a harsh free-kick against him). It was another clean sheet for the Rossoneri, so he’s doing something right along with his colleagues. Thiaw (6): The German had a scare at the end of the game with a backpass for Maignan, but aside from that he was good as usual and won many duels against the attackers. Passing was mostly good too. Jimenez (6.5 – MOTM): Without a doubt, he was the best on the pitch for Milan with contributions in both phases of the game, clever passing and tremendous acceleration to beat his man. We didn’t miss Theo at all, not even when comparing to the latter in good form, and that says a lot about how well he did. Fofana (5.5): It wasn’t his best game for Milan in terms of unlocking stalemates and finding the right spaces, as also shown at the end of the game with some very poor awareness. We can demand much more from him, and he knows it. Reijnders (6): He didn’t always have success with the final touch, but it would have been a much tougher game for Milan without him. The way he can run with the ball past opponents, like Jimenez, is very impressive and helped massively even if it didn’t result in a goal. He also should have had an assist for Morata. Chukwueze (5.5): Aside from some good moments here and there, it was another subpar performance from the Nigerian. The set-piece delivery was okay, but he had several 1v1s tonight and opportunities to cross, but just couldn’t seem to get the end product right. Liberali (6): Before we go any further, we must remember that he’s just 17. It has also been a relatively tough season so far for him between the Primavera and Milan Futuro, so the start was indeed a bit surprising. Having said that, he linked up well enough with his teammates and showed promising signs, so we’ll give him a pass here. Leao (6): A lot of Milan’s attack still revolves around him, and he often did well to beat his man and open up space for his teammates. The crosses and shots, however, were not the best so that is still something that needs to be improved. Abraham (5.5): He had a very good chance in the first half that he squandered and we didn’t really see that much else from him. It was right to take him off at half-time, at least that was the initial thought – but perhaps it’s not correct given how Morata performed. Morata (4): For a player with his experience, you have to put away at least one of those three great chances. First he opted to square it, then he fired wide with a curling effort, and finally he hit the bar from close range. Not good enough, simply put. Camarda (6): He added energy to the attack and also a presence inside the box, which was needed given how low Genoa kept their defence. Okafor (4): Just like Morata, an absolutely awful cameo off the bench. Sluggish and with zero timing. The cross at the end was comical. Sell Okafor now, overhaul this team, I can say the coach isn’t the problem yet, the team lacks attitude and belief. The senior players let us down today. I don’t know about that rating for Reindjers but I feel he was very poor, and we can’t expect Fofana to carry the whole midfield, dude is trying his best. Reijnders is the player wearing n 14 who is carrying Milan midfield ny himself, and trying his best.
Fofana is the player wearing 29 that was poor and couldn’t make the simplest of passes to wide open teammates.
In the 87 th minute Reijnders ran 3/4 of the length of the pitch tracking Genoa’s right winger while the were on the counter, recovers the ball and runs 3/4 the length of the pitch the other way, carrying the ball and in combination with Leao creating a chance that Morata squandered. The hell are you talking about. That’s about as intelligent as anything I’ve seen coming out of Frank Lampard’s mouth. Reijnders has been out best player this season by far. At most he’s tied with Pulisic but I’d agree they have been by far the 2 best. some people just dont know how to watch futbol The season is over after 15 games. Even a CL spot next season seems difficult (only a slim chance if Italy get 5 spots again). So sad to see that we will start at year Zero again next year. SOLO DIRÉ!!! EL QUE APOYE A FONSECA EN ESTA PÁGINA ES UNA RATA!!!! SOLO MIRAD DONDE ESTAMOS 8!!!!!!!! CONFERENCE 🇵🇹🤡🤮 Lay off the coke man. Fonseca out !
I said few weeks ago when were 7th that he had 3 serie A games to get us closer to the top 4 position or else he has to go alongside who brought him and now we’re 8th…. 8 points from 4th place. “bUt We HaVe A gAmE In HaNd!!!” yeah.. and it’s against the current 7th, good luck beating them.
He had the backing of the administration, he got to do what he wanted. Some of the players he wanted were brought to him. Each player who didn’t follow his instructions got benched and tonight he started without the “troublemakers”, only for us to get further and further from fourth place. This season is over, we won’t win the serie A, we wont play in the UCL next season, so what’s the point exactly in keeping him? So we can hear him complain in each post-game conference? There is really no difference between 7th and 17th, so might as well try a new coach.
Maignan: Wasn’t tested tonight, so I can’t give him a grade
Gabbia & Thiaw: They’re defenders and they’re function is to defend, and that was well done. Genoa barely had if at all a shot, so good job.
Jimenez: He honestly did look better than Theo these last few games, but he honestly kept trying too much to shoot from outside the box.
Emerson: was defensively correct, but offensively brought nothing (what a shocker !)
Fofana: same remark as Gabbia and Theo, Genoa didn’t win the midfield but his offensive contribution was very lacking.
Reijnders: did some good runs throughout the middle, but didn’t have the commanding presence he showed a couple of times. If anything, he looked more like the shy Reijnders of last season.
Leao: Sloppy and lacked precision
Chukwueze: Sloppy and lacked precision
Abraham: Does he even try to aim?
Morata: I think he tried to break a record for how many sitters a player can miss.
Okafor: Did he even play ?
Camarda& Liberalli: They’re too young so I can’t be harsh on them, I can just say keep working and hopefully they can have a nice future. Giga totally biased again.  How can you say Emerson offered nothing offensively?  He forced two tough saves from the keeper and the second one was a brilliant save.  Sadly he may have been Milan’s best offensive player today. And Fonseca is not to blame for this game.  Milan dominated possession, didn’t allow a single shot on target and really should have scored at least once or twice.  It’s not his fault Morata couldn’t finish his chances.  As far as the  young players
Jiminez looked very solid, better than Theo has looked this season.
Liberali is not ready for the big time.  His rating of 6 is a joke.  I don’t care about his age, if he’s playing with the big boys he needs to be rated like everyone else and he was pretty bad today.
Pulisic in his absence has made it even more clear that he is our most valuable player.  The offense does not look good when he is out. So Okafor, Chukwueze, RLC, Calabria, Tomori really be packing those bags… at least one good thing came from this game being that Jimenez can be depended on while Theo gets his head sorted. Liberalli and Camarda moment would have made this game all the different but I guess we have to wait a big longer.  Gnoto/Dan Ndoye/Zhergova for RW upgrade, while for LW Noa Lang/Fofana (Lyon)/Pepe (Porto) would give fresh pace and energy.  Chukwueze might be given time until summer since Zhergova has contract until 2026… or maybe Gnoto since Leeds are still in lower league plus the Italian passport helps… RLC should give us a CDM – Frendrup maybe?! Lyon and Genoa are in crisis so that’s our 20M price range right there…  Calabria, Tomori will be given time until the end of the season, I guess…  Jovic, Florenzi, Origi, Ballo-Toure would also be nice to remove from wages… I don’t know how we can fix all these issues in 1 month… Scout master… We’ll done sir Tomori needs to be sold, the man is another English idiot that knows very little about football like the rest of them, all they know is kick and run. Agreed but you can’t replace him that fast. Midfield and at least one winger should be priority.  Bennacer won’t be enough and Liberali + Zeroli are way too young atm. While Okafor and Chukwueze are just dreadful, during Puli absence our right wing just collapsed.  Tomori sale might make sense if we can swap him for Tonali and get Kiwior from Arsenal. These rating are not based in reality.  I will also add everyone wanted Pioli out last year- a second place finish is looking pretty good right now. Tbf, the fans wanted to move on and progress to the next step, and it was pretty clear pioli was at his ceiling. They didn’t ask for this worthless ownership to bring in a bad manager below his level on the cheap, literally the exact opposite of what was demanded. Now the owners have to deal with the consequences of making quick lazy choices Last year the competition was much easier. Look now even Fiorentina and Lazio are fighting for top 4. It was obvious even last year that we are going in the wrong direction. Zero connection between the players, everything is 1v1 and they all hold on to the ball for too long instead of passing to a wide open teammate.
Jimenez and Liberali did great, Reijnders put Abraham and Morata in 4 scoring positions and only 1 put it on goal, with Morata hitting the upright.
Fofana wasn’t good, but by far the worst player was Okafor. Once he came in the game from 11v11 it went to 10v12 advantage Genoa. He didn’t take 1 step, didn’t make 1 move that benefited Milan.
Fonseca should have subbed in Theo for Chuk and move Jimenez to the right wing, at least the kid would have sent a cross or 2.
Milan needs to immediately sign Frendrup. That dude Is a menace. He was everywhere.
All those ex Milan players came back to sit and watch in the cold weather a bad game. For how long do we have to bear this pain of watching Milan play We are now 8th place in the standing while Florentina,our rivals inter& Juventus etc play out their heart for the team What an absolute disgrace for a team like Milan I just wish the team start from scratch from the management down to the player coz this Milan is becoming unbearable to watch Lol, these score are ridiculous. For me, Emerson Royal was our best player on the pitch. The defensive line was solid in total, including Jimenez, and Fofana had a decent 75 minutes until he run out of steam. Everyone else was subpar. Leao, Reijnders, Tammy, Chukweze, all below average. And Libareli looked like a kid playing with adults. The kid might have talent, but he’s nowhere near ready. Camadra as well tbh. Just say you know nothing about the sport buddy. Emerson was a 5 at best as per usual Ratings here are a bad joke. Liberali was abysmal and if you give Morata 4, how Chucky cam have a 5.5??? Abysmal?
He is 17 and played well. He looked way more physical than Morata. Liberali isn’t ready for first team football. Suspect decisions and but really any influence on the game.   Jimenez isn’t a bad option for Theo until his form improves. Putuco… True. People see what they want to see. Liberali was lucky not to have a pk called against him. You are right, you see what you want to see.
 Liberali was unlucky not to have a PK called for him A 19 year old was better than all the grown men. Also, where’s the press? If we pressed we could of done so much better. Fonseca should just steal from Klopp and play heavy metal football. I said Morata wasn’t good enough..I said Abraham wasn’t good enough. At this level you have to take chances.   Gabbia and Thiaw were good as usual, Jimenez  had a great debut… Jimenez played great but it wasn’t his debut as he played something like 3-4 matches last season. Yeah not sure why I said that 😂😂 😀 That’s fair enough and I also came to think afterwards that maybe you was referring to Liberali instead. I think my brain was frazzled after watching that tripe 😂 I’d love to see him play in his natural RB position. What an upgrade from Emerson You were right, both Morata and Abraham are not good enough. They are both very poor finishers. Morata might work like AM/SS tho. same here… link-up play seems to be his strength basically sub for both N10 and N9, just in front of both Liberali and Camarda to give them space to grow. While this also raises who should be starters in those 2 roles for the summer. Puli on RW makes more sense and maybe moving Reijnders there would be better than making our 7 goal scorer into a regista. But that would need a good partner for Fofana, which Bennacer will need time to become after his injury. Musah’s role is also unknown to any coach, has so much stamina, grit and strength, but dreams of being an attacker which he’s just not. I think Jimenez is a good choice for motm as he did a great job throughout the match. Liberali had a fairly decent match as well so in the end I think Fonseca did the right choice in giving them a chance and Jimenez certainly played better than Theo has done recently but unfortunately Madrid can buy him back both in the summer of 25 and 26 which clearly will happen if the player wants to return to Spain. Huge disapointment though that we couldn’t win the match and Even I is now starting to get worried if we actually will be able to qualify for cl next year, I guess the most positive I’ll take from this current disaray of the club is that we at least yet isn’t in as bad form as a superior equipped Man city. Starting to enjoy their matches losing week in week out more than watching Milans matches currently 😀 Disappointing result but nice to see the youngsters getting chances. Like I keep saying, the transfers these past two seasons were done haphazardly, with no clear plan in mind, and we are currently paying the price for that. We have a kind run of fixtures coming up, Bennacer’s return, and the possibility to strengthen in January so hopefully we can qualify for the CL, keep our stars, and rebuild, again. Mediocrity breeds mediocrity. Fire Fonseca now and bring in some experienced coach with charisma and a proven track record. Fonseca has a charisma of a dirty Persian rug. You don’t have much of a choice… Sarri, Allegri are too rigid in their playstyle. Allegri-ball is even less ambitious than Fonseca’s. Sarri never gives young talent chance, so your entire Futuro and Primavera projects would be useless (well Bonera should have been axed long time ago and Abate treatment was unprofessional like Maldini’s). Xavi is 50-50 and our midfield is unusable by him. Ten Haag was let go for a reason, basically dutch version of Fonseca. You then have Sergio Conceicao who is really the only good option. Otherwise, our management will never pay for an actual coach. You saw whom they hired when they had a year to decide. Now you would trust the same people to bring you another coach? LOL!!!  I don’t. All and all, the lineup to this game seems to me like a smokescreen to the shtshow that is Fonseca. Let’s play the entire f’ing, serie c failing, Milan futuro lineup next time. And the substitutions were the cherry on the cake. Ever since he got separated from his wife, Morata is not the same player. Apparently something similar is happening with Theo. I know it’s human and all that, but come on, you’re trained professionals, you can’t allow such massive downgrade, especially when you’re experienced quality footballers. The positives – clean sheet and good performance from Jimenez and Liberali. The negative is a pretty big one – we witnessed the unofficial goodbye to Champions League football this season. This team lacks chemistry and we will not compensate all these absurd mistakes with derby triumphs and winning streaks. The cups are the only thing  that still brings meaning to a disastrous season. As long as RedBird are in charge, we might as well give up home anything is going to change. A bunch of souless amateurs who are somehow incompetent in anything they do. * I meant “Champions League football NEXT season”. Very frustrating game. We had 21 shots against 5 from Genoa but couldn’t score. Arguably two PKs not given, one on LIberali, and the other one on Leão, but we shouldn’t need to get PKs (if the ref were any better) to beat a team like Genoa so that’s not an excuse. Several missed sitters including a post hit. The Gods of Football seem to be mad at Milan and didn’t want to allow the ball to go in, in this very special day of 125th anniversary. Pity. Or actually, shame, because sloppy finishing and missed passes were the rule rather than the exception, despite the players actually  trying hard. Maignan, a spectator, nothing for him to do, so, an automatic pass. 6 Emerson, one of his best games so far. Pretty good, actually. 6.5 Gabbia, solid as usual, 6.5 Thiaw, solid except for an almost own goal. 6 Jimenez, frankly better than Theo. Yes, MOTM, our best player on the pitch. 7.5. If Theo’s attitude doesn’t improve and he doesn’t recover his form and is sold, I guess we have the answer regarding who should replace him. Fofana, mixed bag. Had some good actions but also faded and started making more and more mistakes. 5.5; would have had a pass if not for the decline and missed passes in the last quarter of the game, so, no pass for him. Reijnders, decent but not brilliant. 6 Chuk, a disaster. The worst player. Should have been subbed out even sooner. However his substitute barely did any better. In any case, a 4 for Chuk. Liberali, very young, his inexperience shows, but also his quality. A pass, 6 Leão, tried super hard. Had some interesting moves to put his companions in scoring opportunities but they didn’t help. However, also had some poor finishing and crossing, problems he used to have and had improved on, but they showed up again. A pass, 6 Abraham, again missed a sitter. 5 Substitutes Morata, oh my God, you’re a striker, how do you miss three golden opportunities to unlock the game? You had to bury at least one of them! 4.5 Okafor, barely less bad than Chuk. 4.25 Camarda, didn’t have an impact today. 5.5 Fonseca, 5. Obviously attitude, his latest excuse, is not it given that the players actually did try hard but still, they couldn’t perform. The defense though, was rather impeccable today, but that’s against Genoa’s underpowered offense. With many players missing due to injury, the subs were appropriate attempts to get things going, and he did have the merit of bringing in JImenez who was excellent, and Liberali who was decent. But I can’t give a pass to a coach that doesn’t help his team with beating such a weak team as Genoa. It’s been a constant that we struggle against limited teams, and while the players are also at fault, we can’t exempt the head coach of responsibility, either. Fonseca out… youth players should be introduced to competitive first team matches gradually just like jimenez, camarda and bartesaghi. It helps build up confidence. Throwing Liberali from the start when the team is going through a rough patch doesn’t help. I thought this was points in the bag. One of the worst teams in the league defensively and offensively yet we can’t score against them and they found threats to our goal. Smh.  And this is how we honour our 125 celebrations ?? hahaha. Jokes on us because Cardinale knew what would have happened I suppose (yes I know he was there so he won’t hear the boos they’d give him).  Reinjders for me MOTM but I understand the Jiminez shout….its been a while since we’ve seen a different player at left back so the freshness is there. Buts it’s Genoa though. A capable back up should be able to play against that level of team especially when they didn’t have a right back start for them.
Anyways, Deer boy created alot and tbh he’s such a step above all his midfield peers. I think we’re disappointing him this season with the lack of quality in our team. Performance was so trash! Where’s K? Can we worry now or it’s still not enough games? Just let me know when we can worry. Thanks. Bologna has now legitimately leapfrogged us to 7th btw  As an aside….man the amount of legends in Milan. Just seeing them gives me shivers. Was so beautiful to see them 🤩🤩🤩 I’m always starstruck The problem today was that Genoa were so compact you have to try to pull players out of the box.  That relies on Chukwueze and Leao. One was awful and one has never been anywhere near good enough.  Wasn’t Fonseca brought in to play quick, physical football? Everything either takes too long or, if we do try to play quickly, lacks quality.  Liberali. 17 years old making his debut from the start, looks decent but does nothing special…outside of Pulisic, still the best performance we’ve seen in that role all season 😄😄😄. You couldn’t make it up. He should stay with the first team in my opinion. Some very intelligent runs and once he’d settled down his composure was great. Jimenez. From the first minute he looked like he’s started every game this year. Fantastic.  Overall, an awful watch again! I hope players like Okafor are done after tonight. Unacceptable attitude. Guys Fonseca just needs more time Christmas come early! I just watched the replay, but I can see we have so many shots on goal, and it happen with 3 players from futuro. I think it was good. Give it try again for next match, I believe good result will come. But maybe, I always want that Fonseca always play with 2 strikers. 4132 maybe can be better.  2 strikers will make us more sharp in front. Camarda with Morata/Abraham. And for no. 10, Reijnders or Liberali. Morata and Abraham are well known for missing sitters and being generally poor or mediocre at best at scoring from their chances in front of goal.
So, what a shocker that they have missed so many chances! A lot of things Milan have done just don’t make any sense, and seem to have all been driven at their root from Ibrahimovic. Jovic and Okafor did GREAT last season, coming off the bench and scoring goals, some that were crucial to getting points for Milan that put the team into second place.
Abate, the Primavera coach got outstanding results. So what does the Clown Prince Ibrahimovich do?  He sanctions the hiring of Fonseca, gets Abate fired for stupid nepo baby reasons with his son, and all that diarrhea of brown stuff flowing downhill has led to this  – Fonseca the Clown Coach freezes out the two best super subs from last season, brings two nearly useless re-treads Abraham and Morata who don’t score, have never scored, will never ever score to take their place.  He  Yes, blaming Fonseca for his amateur level coaching is correct.  But the problem goes deeper than that.  Cardinale for reasons known only to him put Ibrahimovich in charge, essentially as the Sporting Director, even though the guy has demonstrated ZERO ABILITY at picking talent in the past. So the line of blame goes back uphill, tracking that flow of diarrhea to the top – to Ibrahimovich most of all, and then to Cardinale for putting Ibra in charge. That chance when Morata cut back onto his left foot and curled it over the bar… the whole move reminded me of the legends sitting in the stand – except Gullit Van Basten Ibra etc would’ve buried it and we’d all be sitting here talking about how we just ground out a 1-0 win. Instead we’re turning into… well, Genoa. That was hard to watch.
Genoa showed almost no threat.  Yet we had very little cohesion in attack.  Liberali looked far to young to me. Morata should have come on for Liberali at half time instead of for Abraham.
Chuk was pretty disappointing.
Leao looked dangerous but lacked help. Emerson still inspires no confidence in me when he goes forward.  He is also constantly play acting for free kicks whenever he has the ball. Milan will not qualify for CL next season. Games like this one today you have to win and collect points. I don’t see them be in the first 5 teams at the end of the season. They all just look lost on the field. Then Leao comes out and in his interview says that just now they are starting to understand what football Fonseca is trying to get them to play? It’s just not working. Period. We can’t blame Fonseca though. We have to blame the Einsteins who took a year and decided that he was the next manager… Then game in and game out they just sit and observe mediocrity without any response… Sad. Because once Maldini left and Gerry came in we had nothing. Pioli was the last piece of the puzzle that had built something. Now everything has derailed. Gerry buying this club was the worst thing that could have happened, he’s a fraud and he will probably lose ownership to Elliott yet again. All the good work we’ve done in the last 5 years seems to be for nothing. True,every word. From the beginning I said, Fonseca is a mediocre loser and the worst possible choice of all the coaches that were being considered. I kept hearing here that Fonseca needed more time. Well, he’s had almost half a season already, and we’re in 8th place. How much more time does he need? Hire someone mediocre, get mediocre results. I doubt that Fonseca will be fired; I doubt that even if he were, our amateur management would hire someone better. It would be another lateral move or a downgrade. But at this point, why keep Fonseca at all? The players don’t like him; he is confusing and he’s making the players play even worse. We actually do have a number of talented players… but Fonseca has made the whole smaller than the sum of the parts.  We won’t win the Scudetto, we won’t even qualify for the Champions League even if Serie A gets 5 spots again. Likely not even 6th for the Europa League. 7th through 17th is the same thing. So, why not just dump the loser and try someone new? It can’t get any worse than our current situation, except if we fall to 18th and get relegated. That, I don’t believe we risk.  But 7th through 17th? Same failure. Might as well do something, get someone new, even if the mid-season move might make we play even worse. At this point we have nothing else to lose, so there is absolutely no reason to keep Fonseca. This Red Cock don’t want to spend much to sign better coach, and better players. I’d rather see cardinale lose the club to elliot than to watch another season like this and with the same clowns in managment. Your email address will not be published.

If a reaction was expected after the loss to Atalanta and the post-match fury from Paulo Fonseca after the Red Star game, it was a reaction that didn’t come as Milan were slow and imprecise all night. Genoa did their bit to make it a frustrating spectacle with a resolute defensive performance, but substitute Alvaro Morata squandered the two biggest chances of the game, hitting the bar with one. The result means that the Rossoneri have not taken any strides towards the Champions League places and have actually dropped to eighth place in the table after Bologna’s win. Paulo Fonseca decided to make five changes to the starting line-up from the team that beat Red Star with Emerson Royal and Alex Jimenez coming into the defence plus Samuel Chukwueze, Mattia Liberali and Tammy Abraham slotting into the attack. The first chance of the game fell to Milan and Leali was called into action. Tijjani Reijnders strode forward unopposed with the ball and a neat interchange involving Tammy Abraham and Emerson Royal saw the latter have a low shot tipped behind. Reijnders was again the man who was the spark for the second chance too, seizing a stray pass out of the back and feeding it to Abraham on the right side of the box. The Englishman had time and space to shoot, but dragged his effort wide of the far post. Twenty minutes into the game Milan had a big penalty shout turned down as Liberali received the ball and cut onto his left foot but was brought down by Miretti, yet the referee Marco Guida told him to play on. Replays showed there was contact, though the official perhaps did not like the theatrical fall. The Rossoneri then assumed control of the game as Reijnders came close with a free-kick from a narrow angle that was taken short and deflected just over, before a lovely flick from Rafael Leao allowed Jimenez to cross for Samuel Chukwueze whose first-time shot sailed over. Not long before the break Genoa had a penalty shout of their own and it was roles reversed from the previous incident with Miretti going over under Liberali’s challenge. It looked a good shout, but the referee remained consistent in not awarding anything other than a stone wall spot kick. The final moment of danger in the first half came when Jimenez tried his luck from distance with a right-footed shot from outside the area, with a deflection changing the direction though Leali managed to gratefully gather. Fonseca made a change at the break with Alvaro Morata coming on for Abraham, a like-for-like change with the Spaniard coming on having passed a late fitness test. Leali was instantly called into action in the second half when he made an excellent diving stop at full stretch to deny a header from Emerson Royal that looked to be angling perfectly towards the far corner. The second half descended into a lull and so, shortly after he sailed a cross out for a goal kick, Liberali was taken off for Francesco Camarda. Genoa’s game plan of sitting off Milan and trying to frustrate them was working as there was very little in the way of scoring opportunities in the second half generally. Leao dragging a shot wide of the near post and Jimenez firing off target from 25 yards were as good as things got up to minute 70. Morata had a chance to make himself the hero off the bench when Reijnders led a break and slid a through ball to him on the right side of the box, yet the Spaniard – who cut inside well to send the defender sliding past – curled a shot high of the top left corner. Straight after that missed chance, Noah Okafor came on for Chukwueze and he took up a position on the right rather than his usual left-sided role. Morata then spurned an even bigger chance to open to scoring with 15 minutes left. Again it was Reijnders who provided the pass that seemed to unlock the Genoa defence, playing through to the striker who somehow rattled the crossbar from about 10 yards out with only the goalkeeper to beat. So proud of the lads. Excellent display. Scudetto, here we come!! Utter horse Sh!t! If that’s the best we have in front of all those legends, amongst all that celebration then it’s embarrassing…don’t blame Fonseca, blame the c@nts who hired him..if you put a fiat on the track don’t expect it to give you Ferrari lap times…. F@ck you RedTurd If Zlatan was the man he thinks he is, he’d resign. Yes That shot of him and Moncada at the end…f@ck them…the fans are right to be pi$$ed but be pi$$ed higher up the food chain than Fonseca. He’s an average coach doing an average job…what more do we expect? Exactly. Every time they showed the Three fng Stooges I lost it. They have the audacity to ruin Milan and can’t do the right thing afterwards. Fonseca is working with what they gave him. And what was that? Emerson fng Royal. And the right thing would be to resign. Obviously. Fonseca and I bra are two incompetent buffoons. We are 14 points behind Atalanta! I don’t understand what we are waiting to fire both of them. QUE MÁS QUERÍA!!!!! ES FONSECA EL CAMPEÓN DE Ucrania 🤡🇵🇹🤮 I think Fonzy just lost the dressing room now Disaster,this is not my club I had no idea how much Pulisic was doing for our offense.  Liberali was good, hope to see more of him.   Did Chuk get the memo there was a game today? My Kid… Pulisic moves the play forward and to the side. Stats don’t show that work. Nope, I don’t care for any more experiments, I’ll see you in the champ League run and if nothing changes about the gaffer then next season in the league. Lets take Alegri and try to stop this s*it show that started with redbird F***k you and your Allegri Nothing mine with Alegri, just the only chance to see Milan in CL next season. And yes, a lot of people are and will get f… I also will, with my homie we just doin it for the gags(Both definitions of gag) If Theo comes back into the team the jiminez needs to be our right back. Best performance from a full back all season. Also…#fonsecaout When would the the management sack Fonseca? The entire management team need to go including Ibra.  Shame on some fans as well. When they ought to gave credit to Maldini, Masera and Poili then, they were heaping praise on Ibra and Moncada. Where is the Ibra factor now? Where is the motivation speech? Cardineli and his team need to sell this team to those who have the financial capabilities. It obvious he didn’t have the financial muscle to manage team like Milan. That very true some milan fans were giving ibra the praise over pioli and maldini, i new no good was coming from sacking pioli and maldini selling tonali, even if fosenca is sack the management will hire  another average coach,but the worst thing we can do now is overhaul the squad, why because cheap alternatives will be signed by this management, e.g royal Chukuweze can play lb for all I care. Royal, can’t really say you did bad…. Think it was decent except for 2 occasions. Leao can’t do it on his own, and you could see he even lost faith in the end. What a kak performance! But we can’t be really surprised right?
Fofana looked depleted in the last minutes… we’re lucky Genoa didn’t come to attack us really. 125 celebrations? Wow… an embarrassment How long we need to wait for #fonsecaout ?? Finaly again ( like 2 weeks ago) we have a chance to go up after Fiorentina lose and Juve draw ( tomorrow is game Lazio- Inter ) .. clear way to UCL place but no , Our mastermind Fonseca play his great attacking style and we are now 8th 😀 what’s a shame … shame on you mister and go out from the club !! Who knew we’re not even a midtable team without Pulisic – just a fng relegation level bunch of losers. I’m sure all the legends REALLY enjoyed the match. Especially since all of them would have been better on the pitch than the current players. I’d take 51-year-old Pippo Inzaghi on the pitch over Abraham & Morata any day. Or Donadoni over Chukwueze. I think chuks was better than fresh leg Okafor. Milan was a ,an down when he came on I think Balotelli was so hungry to come on and score a goal to ruin the celebration 😂😂😂 I hope after this game all the legends can sit around the table with the management and discuss the issues and solutions to this Milan.  I can’t see a single drop of great Rossoneri blood in any of the senior players I think chuks was better than fresh leg Okafor. Milan was a ,an down when he came on. They hate on pioli for guarantee us top 4 with this quack management, now They are begging for top 4 finish, it hasn’t even been half a season lol, the players are not the problem, if you like do a stupid overhaul and return us to banta era The players are not the problem, Fonseca is the problem.

Follow the action with our watchalong, hosted by Stefano, as well as our live commentary.  Paulo Fonseca has decided to make some bold XI choices for this one, with youngsters Alex Jimenez and Mattia Liberali starting. For the latter, it will be the official debut with the first team and it remains to be seen how he will cope with that. The Rossoneri celebrated their 125th anniversary with a ceremony ahead of the game, but adding three points as well is of the essence. You can follow the action with our watchalong, hosted by Stefano this time out, and our live commentary as published on X.  Tweets by SempreMilanCom
 Official Milan XI (4-2-3-1): Maignan; Emerson Royal, Gabbia, Thiaw, Jimenez; Fofana, Reijnders; Chukwueze, Liberali, Leao; Abraham. Bench: Sportiello, Torriani, Calabria, Morata, Okafor, Theo Hernnadez, Tomori, Pavlovic, Bartesaghi, Terracciano, Vos, Camarda. Official Genoa XI (3-5-1-1): Leali; Vogliacco, Bani, Vasquez; Zanoli, Frendrup, Badelj, Thorsby, Martin; Miretti; Pinamonti. Bench: Sommariva, Gollini, Bohinen, Vitinha, Pereiro, Norton-Cuffy, Sabelli, Maracndalli, Ankeye, Matturro, Balotelli, Accornero, Melegoni, Masini. How is that not a penalty when Theo got given in against him for brushing the foot of a player 1. Ref sucks. Milan had at least one PK not called, if not more. 2. Chuk is doing poorly, missed a sitter and wasted other offensive actions. 3. Rafa is doing well, dangerous, energized. 4. Reijnders also doing well. 5. Liberali, mixed bag. Some good actions, some others that show he is young and inexperienced. 6. Jimenez, frankly, is playing better than Theo had been playing. 7. Emerson not bad, tonight, 8. Generally, the team is moving well, playing well, and deserves to be leading; unfortunately due to the ref and to some unlucky bounces, plus some missed opportunities, we’re not leading yet. Eveeeeeery time we are complaining about the ref ffs. Small team mentality. It was a 50/50 moment. Get over it and move on If we are relying on penalty against Genoa, let’s go to Serie B rather The fact that we should be leading regardless of the ref doesn’t mean we can’t talk about mistakes made by the ref. I don’t single out the refs when they don’t make mistakes.  There was a clear PK on Rafa when he was pushed and shoved into the ground. There is nothing 50/50 about it. It was a PK, period, full stop. By the way, the foul by Miretti on Liberali inside the box was also a PK, which Italian journalists are confirming. That’s 2 PKs not called for us. “Moviola: Non bene Guida; manca un rigore netto.” Embarrassing cry You’re ridiculous. What team do you actually support? AC MIlan, it isn’t, because if you can’t see when a ref doesn’t call a legitimate PK for us, you’re not a real fan. So, go away, troll. Lol, you were probably not even born when I started supporting AC Milan. I am just not the same as you who cries for penalties against teams like fooking Genoa More of a penalty than the one Liberali was meant to have committed Chuk is a really selfish player. Decent debut by Liberali. Some signs of expected naivety but some good stuff too, a great pass in the first half and should have won a penalty. I actually continue to mostly like what I see. The team is not playing badly. However, a chronic problem, finishing has been poor.  Morata had a golden opportunity and instead of shooting, he passed. Bad decision. We SHOULD be leading but we’re sloppy in finishing. And I miss the time when Pulisic was healthy and playing right wing which is his best position. We probably would be leading if we had Puli there instead of Chuk. It’s the same story for years, have a lot of possession but not do anything clinical. We lack intensity, Fofana is the only one who seems to have it…. And another sitter missed by Morata 🙄 Now what can you say bout Okafor coming on for chuks Couldn’t finish his f@cking dinner…….. Signature move from Morata.
Misses a tap in and cries to the referee for a Bluetooth fault Morata has always been a crier and not a fighter… wish Pato was wearing the 7 Jersey this night I am very impressed with Jimenez….
Very fast, slick with his dribbles, provides good crosses. Few more games and he will gain more experience and confidence. It’s hard to say but he reminds me of Di Marco from parasite Inter Utter sh!te this performance Wonderful game for our anniversary 😂 The sooner we fire this clueless ‘coach’ and replace him with someone competent, the better our chances of salvaging the season are. Please, finally show some guts and ambition and let him go! Unambitious board cannot and will not sign ambitious coach. This is the rule of football and our life in general. I don’t want to be a smartazz, just saying what is on my mind They failed to score in the greatest kits in front of the greatest players, against a poor opponent.
SAD We are disaster.Morata cant play at this club. Everything is bad. This club is lost this season. This is the final confirmation we need… Milan isn’t playing in Europe next season; not even in the conference League. If we can’t beat Genoa in San Siro, then the team is as useless as they come. Sadly, and very annoyingly, Ibra will come to the mics and day something stupid along the lines of “we trust the coach”. This is nothing but self inflicted implosion. Hard to believe we won the Scudetto just 3 seasons ago…😔 Okafor  is the most useless plater on the field tonight.  I can categorically said Fonseca was right bout the team lack of mentality and grit. Jimenez was the best player on the field tonight. And I think Fonseca could have brought in Thoe and push jimenez to the right wing when he sub Chukwueze. Secondly Fonseca should have pair one of Zeroli or Vos with Fofana and push Tijani to play behind the striker. For me Emerson has always been nothing to right home about. He doesn’t even know how to move his feet….  A win to celebrate the 125th Anniversary would have been so beautiful  But the team without soul even seeing all the past legends that gave glorious to our beloved Milan..   Looking at Pato in the stand and seeing the number 7 on Morata with those missed scoring chances. Put a whole lot of smiles to my face and only wish Pato could wear the 7 Jersey one more time tonight.  ForzaMilan🔴⚫ I hope after this game all the legends can sit around the table with the management and discuss the issues and solutions to this Milan.  I can’t see a single drop of great Rossoneri blood in any of the senior players Is not Fonseca fault the issues is that Acmilan fans should have patience the team will blend is a matter of time Acmilan is on point ok imagine Juventus draw with Venezia and we drew against Genoa. Acmilan should focus on pressing with the ball before we knew Acmilan will start doing better at least liberali did superb with Jimenez now we also need Chaka Traore too.

The headlines in the build-up to the game have been dominated by the fact Fonseca was very forthright after Wednesday’s win, raising concerns about the attitude of the team. It had led to suggestions that he would shake up the team, and he has done exactly that by benching the vice-captain Theo Hernandez in place of Alex Jimenez. Mattia Liberali will also get the nod as one of four alterations from the Red Star game, something the absences of Christian Pulisic, Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Yunus Musah have also contributed to. Ibrahimovic spoke to DAZN about 30 minutes before kick-off in the game against Genoa, and his comments were relayed by MilanNews. Today we celebrate the legends of Milan, will we see players from your Milan as legends in the future? “Let’s hope so, that’s what we’re looking for and what we want. That is, to make history.”

  What did you think of Fonseca’s words after the match against Red Star? “The coach is looking for a reaction, especially after a match like this. What he said in public he also said in private. If I were a footballer I would react, because if the coach is not happy you have to do more. We agree with him, the team has to do more and we have to push for them to do more.” Theo Hernandez has been left out… “The same situation with Rafa a few weeks ago. Theo is one of the best left-backs in the world, we want him to be at his best but he will definitely return. The coach makes his choices that everyone respects and when they return to the pitch they have to make the difference.” Alex Jimenez and Mattia Liberali meanwhile will start… “It depends on them, too. You have to seize the opportunity. It’s a great opportunity for them, we’re very curious. We have faith in our talents who have to stay when they come in. “These talents of Milan Futuro train almost every day with the first team: the opportunity arrives, but when it arrives you have to take it.” Your email address will not be published.

Playing from the first minute, the winger must show his qualities.  It has been a season of ups and downs for Chukwueze, just like Milan overall, and he has not been able to get consistent playing time on the right. With Christian Pulisic currently injured, however, he now has the opportunity to show Paulo Fonseca what he can do. Before the special game against Genoa, as transcribed by MilanNews, Chukwueze spoke to DAZN and shared his thoughts on what is needed to win. Given the special occasion, with the club celebrating its 125th anniversary, a strong performance is needed. On the game… “It’s important to win today, we have to focus. The coach was satisfied with the last few days, we have to keep the legendary history of this club alive.” On his role… “I think it’s really important to play in this role. The coach believes in me. For us, it’s important to attack well but also to defend well.” The Nigerian will be playing in the attacking trio along with Mattia Liberali and Rafael Leao, so it will certainly be interesting to see how they will get on together. Seeing as Liberali isn’t the most physical player, Chukwueze might have to help out more in defence. Chuk has to start using his right leg if he wants to stay in the league Your email address will not be published.

The headlines in the build-up to the game have been dominated by the fact Fonseca went on a bit of a rant about the attitude of the team after the narrow win over Red Star at home. It led to reports stating that he was going to mix up the team a bit, something that the absences of Christian Pulisic, Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Yunus Musah have also contributed to. The four-man defence is Emerson Royal, Matteo Gabbia, Malick Thiaw and Alex Jimenez ahead of Mike Maignan, with Theo Hernandez therefore dropping to the bench. Tijjani Reijnders and Youssouf Fofana are in the midfield double pivot once again, with Samuel Chukwueze, Mattia Liberali and Rafael Leao the attacking trident behind Tammy Abraham. It is a big opportunity for Jimenez and Liberali, who have spent pretty much the entire season with Milan Futuro to this point. Alvaro Morata and Noah Okafor are on the bench having recovered. Official Milan XI (4-2-3-1): Maignan; Emerson Royal, Gabbia, Thiaw, Jimenez; Fofana, Reijnders; Chukwueze, Liberali, Leao; Abraham. Bench: Sportiello, Torriani, Calabria, Morata, Okafor, Theo Hernnadez, Tomori, Pavlovic, Bartesaghi, Terracciano, Vos, Camarda. Official Genoa XI (3-5-1-1): Leali; Vogliacco, Bani, Vasquez; Zanoli, Frendrup, Badelj, Thorsby, Martin; Miretti; Pinamonti. Bench: Sommariva, Gollini, Bohinen, Vitinha, Pereiro, Norton-Cuffy, Sabelli, Maracndalli, Ankeye, Matturro, Balotelli, Accornero, Melegoni, Masini. No bench players @Oliver Fisher? Would love to see the futuro perform well.  Forza Milan, let’s get the 3 points Mario Baloteli at Genoa ??? Yup, I had noticed that previously but he joined them in late October so he hasn’t played much for them yet. Why does fonsesca love thiaw so much I wish the young lads the best and hopefully they do well. However this seems more like Fonseca venting his anger than giving youth a chance.
These young players should be nurtured, start by giving them minutes at the end of games. Throwing them in on a night like tonight and expecting them to perform is unfair.
Thats very poor player management. Also Jimenez is a right back! Can’t understand why the coach doesn’t play Pavlovic at LB, it would do him good. After that Bartesaghi is more ready and a natural LB. Vos is the only midfield alternative on the bench  This may be Fonsecas night that makes or breaks him This guy’s a genius 🤣 Man said to play pavlovic at lb😭🙏. Might as well have no lb rather than play pavlovic Pavlovic is a senior pro not a youth player for starters.
He has played on the left of a back 3 many times and has the pace to break forward.
He needs opportunities to improve his game and at left back he is less of a liability than CB. It seems a very logical solution. Thanks for the feedback, i look forward to reading your insights i dont know what they’re smoking
but playing pavlovic as lb actually makes sense
he’s fast despite his size
just like stam used to play as rb too
it probably will hinder the attack from left side but the defense will also probably more solid hopefully liberali and jiminez shine It will probably be Mike, due to seniority, but I hope Gabbia gets the armband. Since bologna won fiora and leapfrog us this is a must win game now. It was a must win before but now it’s very must win.
Ultra must win. It should be an interesting match to watch with the youngsters included. Hopefully they will do well and we will get a victory. It would be nice if Vos also can get a chance today. Don’t like two futuro players as starters. One already is more than enough. An arrogant formation by Fonseca, who seems to be more interested in proving his point than winning. I hope his gamble pays off. We can’t complain about this. Theo needs to get his acts together.  We are Milan and everyone playing for us must have a heart for the team. Theo feels indispensable and I think it is right for the coach to let him know he has to wake up. Liberali hopefully pulls well from what we saw at preseason. No caps, I don’t want us to lose him We lost Daniel. I really hope for a reaction in the is game and I hope that liberali will play a great game. Forza milan! 2-1 for Milan Leo and Reji to score for Milan with Liberali and Chuk assist and for Genoa Hope Balotelli’s score today 😂 3-1.
Emerson royal hattrick 0-0. These jerseys are great.
I wish they had an option to buy every jersey without the shirt sponsors. Maybe a jersey with allegri for you Ha ha 😂.
Struck a nerve i see.
I would never walk around with another person name on my back. But will get you one with Benitez on the back. Funny how days after reports that Liberali might leave he’s in the starting lineup… hope he does well – it’s going to be an interesting evening… Wow, fonseca went full crazy.
Let’s hope it will still be enough… Oh Emerson, why couldn’t you cross that after a nice ball by Liberali? How is he still starting ffs?
Absolutely useless player Dude needs 3 touches to control the ball.
He’s so useless.
Worst player we have on the team by far All i want is Kalulu back. We didn’t need or ask for any money to be spent on RB. He is one of the worst football players i have ever seen.
I would play Tomori, Terraciano, Jimenez, Musah, anyone over him P. S Chucky is another car crash It was a no brainer.  Keep kalulu and play him rb. Use the cash for a midfielder.
But nope. Chuku just can’t get into rhythm.  He’s got some skillz but it’s so random when they surface.. usually he just doesn’t do anything. Emerson is so bad, he needs to retire. Is it mediocrity we are celebrating tonight?
So so ordinary and void of ideas At least Jimenez and Liberali have started reasonably well Morata to come on for Liberali. Oh, it’s for Tammy. Hmm… Idk why he did that..Abe had literally 0 traffic to work with.
Liberali on the other hand , well that was a penalty,  let’s be honest. What exactly has emerson done bad this game? People are just finding ways to hate him more. He ain’t the best rb but he’s been better than Calabria which isn’t saying much. As I write this he almost scored. You’re drunk as fvck if you think Emerson is better than Calabria. Starting to smell like a 1-0 Genoa win. The kind where we have 60% possession and like 15 shots for nothing, and then make one mistake in the 85th minute and concede a goal. SuperMario to be the culprit too. Come on camarda. Steal the show! Perhaps we could bring on Theo for Emerson, play Jimenez at RB? Might give us some cutting edge I guess Okafor is the other option to bring on, perhaps for Liberali or Chucky Feels like we shouldn’t have made this the 125 anniversary game…should’ve got Milan legends out there for a kickabout instead of sitting in the stands studying their phones and made this a regular league game. Think if you gave fonseca wc players in every position his approach still wouldn’t work. Dull, uninspiring game Can we get f-cking Emerson and Chucky off the pitch!!!!! Theo and Okafor on the bench, what are we doing!!!! This manager is f-cking blind!! And he failed his first dribble… Give him a minute, the guy gets no play time.
Chucky failed at everything as he always does Theo is not coming on dude. His benching is a statement, he’ll remain there all game, or else the manager loses what he was hoping to accomplish with that. Really, this game is just plain mediocrity. I was hoping for some real transformation, but…
Anyway, I just watched 15mins of the game and there is nothing interesting to see more. Uuggghh. Morata should have scored twice already. Waiting for that Genoa sucker punch… Is Okafor drunk? Fonseca is the drunk one. Abe off morata on.
Wtf And Thiaw.. fk it I think the whole team’s sozzled Genoa free kick. Here it comes! Pretty flat performance.
Really. Disgraceful. Well, we didn’t lose… What a f-cking embarrassed this team is to the club tonight See ya in Friday.  I’m out Positives today -Jimenez
-……………………………………. Better performance than Red Star for the last 15 mins (what I saw) but a worse result. Morata needs to stop trying to go for the top corner. Just hit it low from than range.

It has rarely been calm at Milan in the past few weeks and it has been another turbulent last few days for the club, following on from Paulo Fonseca’s decision to criticise the attitudes of certain members of the team after the win against Red Star on Wednesday. Milan are going into their 125th birthday celebrations with a feeling of being on the edge of a crisis, and not just because of the poor results in the league to this point either which have not helped the new coach’s cause. Thus, there is pressure on the Portuguese to engineer a turnaround, with the management no doubt watching the evolution of his relationship with the players closely, all with a top four finish the minimum objective. Campi spoke on the show ‘Ti Amo Calciomercato.it’ broadcast on the official YouTube channel of the website and he comments on what Fonseca’s tirade might mean. “Fonseca’s outburst makes me say that the rift between the coach and the players continues to exist . For this reason, I wouldn’t be surprised if before the end of the season, once mathematical qualification for the Champions League has been achieved, Allegri arrives, who is putting a lot of pressure on him to return to coach in Italy,” he said (via PianetaMilan).

  “I know he has had several contacts with various people at Milan. Antonio D’Ottavio left the other day and Allegri would also like to bring Federico Cherubini as sporting director. He is someone who knows how to work with the Next Gen and the Rossoneri need to work with Milan Futuro. “I saw him on TV with the Livorno coach watching a few games at the stadium, a sign that their bond and the esteem between the two is strong. It’s a combo that could be recomposed soon: if not immediately, in June at Milan. “Allegri is desperate to return, to show Juventus that he is not finished and to finish ahead of the Bianconeri. It will be a very personal challenge for him against Cristiano Giuntoli.” Rather have Bonera coach us than this guy… fifa boy IncelTurtle… :)) I would rather electrocute my balls with a car battery than either coach AC Milan. obviously, lmao… out of all the coaches we can get Sergio Conceicao is the only replacement that I would take… Sarri too rigid with younger players and the rest of the coaches we have been targeted with aren’t that good… Conceicao a decent shout, worth the risk and available. Agreed with most of the sentiment here, Fonseca is unimpressive but if he goes, Allegri is just another sideways (or backwards) step. We need someone better. 😀
I wouldn’t mind him either but same goes for Xavi if he is still available. I wouldn’t mind Sarri either but simply can see us hiring him. In the end if we were to sack Fonseca I expect us to sign someone off most people radar so doubt anyone of the before mentioned would arrive. Xabi Alonso ain’t coming to Milan, not in a million years.  He’s almost certainly going to go to Real Madrid when he makes a move.   Bayern would love to get him, but I think he’s only going to go back to Spain and Real can outbid anybody for him.
He’s Basque, so it’s not out of the question for Barcelona to try for him, even though he played for Real.
The guy is a superstar in the coaching world.
Gerry Cardinale doesn’t get into the bidding for superstars Not Xabi Alonso even though that would be pretty damn great but Xavi who coached Barcelona last season but to my knowledge currently not in a job. If we’re talking coaches that are currently available AND realistic, I’d give van Bommel and Niko Kovac a hard look as well. I’m making a screenshot of your comment if and only if either comes in, you are finished…. 😊🤣😂 hahaha
I think you sorta misread my comment as I didn’t say i would electrocute my balls if they arrived I said id rather elctrocute my balls than them getting hired as our coach. Quite the difference 😀 Don’t like his style of football but from the coaches available , the squad Milan has and the defensive issues they have, he would be the coach i want Milan to hire.
Juventus is great defensively even this season thanks to his principles. Motta has brought nothing new at Juventus. Great defensively, awful offensively.
Most juve fans sh!t on him and worship Motta but Juventus plays the same way this season with worse results even after over 200 m spent.
Through 16 games under Allegri with way weaker squad last season 37 points, 24:10 goal difference and 11 wins.
Through 16 games and 200+m spent under Motta 28 points, 26:12 goal difference, 10 draws.
BTW Atalanta leads serie A with 37 points this season.
His football isn’t pretty, but gets results and it’s not like Pioli’s or Fonseca’s football were/are pretty either. anyone but lord allegri.. you must be insane to chose him over all other available  coaches.
i’d take de rosi or juric over this turd in a hearbeat Right, because De Rossi and Juric did such a great job at Roma, compared to the coach who has won 2nd most Scudetti (6) in serie A history and took a team to 2 UCL finals. Ancient history.  If you wanna coach who won something a million years ago, benitez is much better than allegri.
He actually won CL Let’s talk about allegri of the second juve stin. That’s the guy you wanna hire. Not the guy who dominated serie a with no competition With an awful squad, club turmoil and off the pitch distractions he finished 4th, 3rd, 3rd in his 2nd stint at Juventus.
Rafa Benitez hasn’t done anything worthy in over a decade while Allegri had his greatest success in these past 10 years.
At Bayern, Napoli and Everton Carlo Ancelotti was considered a failure and done as a coach and then Real Madrid resurrected his career.
Rafa Benitez, De Rossi, Juric, ha ha ha That juve sqaud wasn’t awful at all.
Napoli had a worse sqaud and managed to win.
Don Carlo was never considered a failure.  Wtf are you smoking?
Don’t even mention allegri and anceloti in a same comment. Don Carlo was a failure at Bayern. They fired him a month into his 2nd season.
Failure at Napoli. Fired him 3 months into his 2nd season.
Failure at Everton.
52 and 46 winning percentage at Napoli and Everton.
Not a failure? Ok.
You were talking about Allegri 2nd stint at Juventus. Carlo Ancelotti went through a 4 year coaching period where he was a failure after a failure, worse winning percentage than Allegri’s 54 in his 2nd stint at Juventus.
Juventus finished 3rd in the year where Napoli won the scudetto, ahead of inter and Milan with weaker squad. If you remember, Allegri Juve notch a lot of 1-0 win in the first half and dropped off horribly. So I fair comparison with this year’s new Juve. The bottom line is anyone but him. Although allegri has won lots of trophies and titles he doesn’t fit our formation and he’s playing style is out of date and could never keep us with the likes of inzaghi, gasparini or conte, and Luis Enrique is rumored to be the next manager it’s not likely, I think the best options are sarri and conceicao I prefer conceicao because he a proven winner. But honestly we should go for Gasperini although he looks very comfortable at Atalanta he’s even come out and stated to the public that he wouldn’t mind joking us and he’s a very consistent strong minded manager
(Overall conciecao and Gasperini are the best options, and should be our top priority) When will people realize that Fonseca is not going anywhere and we are stuck with him until the end of the season??? If we don’t make top 4 (or top 5 if Serie A earns again a 5th Champions League spot) then and only then he will be fired. Not before. The managers don’t understand football. They only understand money. Only if Fonseca fails to qualify for the UCL, which will affect the money, he will be fired. Not winning the league has no bearing whatsoever on his tenure, as far as how the managers see it. Remember, for them, “winning is boring.” Now, if Fonseca does lose money for the club, then and only then, he’s gone. Enough with all this speculation about new coaches. Half way into the season, Fonseca is not leaving, period, full stop. Sure, having spent over €200 million, the owners concerns over the coach are purely financial. Stop making a show of yourself. If he’s prepared, (I mean Allegri) then he should probably give Milan a promise to collect the treble,(i.e Champions League, Coppa Italia and the Serie A) then he will be remembered for as the best coach that broke a worthwhile record with Milan I’d rather sink with Fonseca than die a slow painful death with Allegri. This man is definition of anti-football. I don’t want allegri either but he has pedigree and has won. Could be a figure that the players listen to and respect. Would rather stick it out with Fonseca at this point. Look at Roma don’t want that mess to happen to us. This was the problem with getting rid of Pioli and now Fonseca….who are this management going to bring in to replace them because it’s highly unlikely to be Conceição or anyone the fans actually want. Capello football was no different than Allegri. Both they both have something in common. Their teams are defensively solid and they win trophies.  If Allegri is given the right quality players then Milan can win titles with him. Love him or hate Allegri is a winner and a safer bet than Sarri or Conceição.  Personally, I would love to Allegri as Milan new coach but only under 2 conditions: 1. We need a proper sporting director not a scout and 2. We need to invest in strengthening the squad.  Our team has a good foundation to build on. A foundation that is better than Juventus who’s squad is far from a complete project and better than Inter who has an aging squad.  Reinjders, Fofana, Pulisic, Leao, Abraham, Maignan, Gabbia, Thiaw, and Morata should be confirmed next season. But there is still some investment needed to bring this team back up to challenge for the scudetto. The only problem is Capello was a coach nearly 2 decades ago and Allegri was using it today and lost against Israeli club in CL. We are kinda stuck with Fonseca until the league stage of CL is finished. A lot of money is at stake, and with luck we can even go one or two steps further. Replacing the coach midseason is anyways always a gamble. But if our situation in the league continues to deteriorate, there will be no other option but to send the drama queen that is Fonseca to wherever he came from. First, I personally don’t prefer Allegri as a coach..
But he’s a great choice for management(who has no football knowledge) this season. Allegri can handle the current situation with players, and lose less games. He’s Yes-man guy. He won’t go far… The twisted part is that this team doesn’t score much after just a brief time. He plays totally different football than what the owner wants, kinda contradict.. After this season, he will be the one that makes management feel annoyed, while he’s having good relationship with players. Emerson would be sold asap due to defense. It’d net a big lost from what they paid. Wasn’t he throwing stones at as when he was at Juve?
Now wants to come back? This is a definition of a ‘man’ without any dignity. If he is the last coach on the planet, let’s play without a coach Please tell me this is a joke?
There are actually very good options out there right now If this idiot come i will not watch any game this season. Allegri isn’t going to take a short term contract. Management want Klopp, who’ll be available at the end of the season. Your email address will not be published.

Calciomercato.com report that it is an ‘unhappy period for Theo Hernandez’. During this first part of the season, the French full-back has had a series of questionable performances below the expectations of the coach, the management and the fans. Everyone expects the vice-captain (who wears the armband basically every game due to Davide Calabria being mostly out of the team) to take on greater responsibility than what he has shown in this first third of the season. It is normal that some questions could be raised about his future, especially amid the possibility that he will not take to the field in the 125th anniversary game against Genoa tonight. In the meantime his deal runs out in 2026, meaning summer puts him a year from expiry. Negotiations between the parties to extend it and review his salary of €4.5m net per year plus bonuses have not yet begun. Contacts to find a solution to the contract renewal have not been so frequent in recent times, so things need to take a turn one way or another.

SM Exclusive: Fonseca makes Colombo request to Milan management – the situation
22 July 2024, 9:00




  A January sale is not totally off the table even if Milan intend to pocket at least €50m from a potential sale. Theo has many admirers around Europe starting with Manchester United, who are looking to replace Luke Shaw. Real Madrid and Bayern Munich are keen too, and it revolves around the future of Alphonso Davies who could either renew or join Los Blancos. Whoever doesn’t secure Davies’ services could turn to Theo, as could Paris Saint-Germain where he would go to rejoin his brother Lucas. Keeping any off-field issues to the side, Theo situation is a mixed bag of d*cks. Fonseca won’t let him attack. He’s not as good defending and in my opinion falls down looking for calls too much – something I never liked about him. So what would drive him to stay?  On the other hand, even what limited defensive form he possesses has been on a decline for a while now. While he may not agree with Fonseca he’s being paid money to do whats asked of him and perform and not compromise the defense of the team. He needs to work on himself and elevate his form. Shape Up or Ship Out. Most of these reports are based on CM writers trying to connect dots than reporting based on actual interest from clubs.
PSG has Nuno Mendes who is Theo-like full back, 5 years younger and is about to extend his contract. But because Theo’s brother is playing there let’s just throw in PSG as a team to watch out because Theo would like to play there even though PSG doesn’t need or want him.
Real Madrid got rid of Theo for attitude and behavior issues, but they are going to come and sign him again even though 6 year later he still has those same issues or maybe worse. Not to mention that they just extended Mendy, the LB they signed for 50 m in the same summer when they sold Theo for 20m and won 2 UCL’s with him.
Bayern looks like they will resign Davies, or if they don’t they want to go for Leipzig and Germany LB David Raum.
What the football world thought of Theo showed this past summer when he publicly opened the door for leaving Milan and no one knocked and made a serious offer for Theo.
His behavior and effort this season surely makes teams trip over each other to offer more money to sign him.
He should get his head out of his arse and lower his unreasonable salary demands, resign with Milan, start acting like a professional because the special treatment and pampering he has been getting at Milan he won’t get anywhere else. Yep, Theo’s attitude has been unprofessional, but there is no possible fix at this point, for the various reasons I listed below in my other post in this thread. Nope, he won’t stay and fix his attitude. He’s gone. His agent will be able to make a point to other clubs that Theo’s decline was a reaction to the environment at Milan rather than a lack of skills. Clubs with good scouts and good sporting directors will likely listen to this argument. Theo is still very young, up to recently was rightly considered to be one of the best left backs in the world, so, he is likely to recover his form once the environment pleases him. At his likely devalued price point, scouts and sporting directors would have to be idiots to not want a player of his level, for a likely bargain. I’m quite sure he will find takers, once he and his agent clearly state that he does not want to stay and will not be staying with Milan. Could see him playing wing back somewhere that uses that formation. Too expensive for Xabi Alonso’s Leverkusen but what about United under Amorim? I think he’d be perfect. Sure they’re not a UCL team but they pay the big bucks. I could see this happening in summer, 40-50mn fee and he gets his 9m net/season wages. Now if only we’d retained Kerkez ….. Great freaking post. Theo is all but gone. His poor performances are not out of a lack of skills. He can’t have unlearned to play football in such a short period; thinking of a decline of skills while he is young and in his prime years, is completely absurd. It’s not skills, it’s his state of mind, and the fault is the managers’ and the coach’s. Sure, one can say that Theo’s attitude is unprofessional. Maybe so. But he’s human. What happened is that he is unhappy with the coach who doesn’t want him to run up and support the offense (which has always been his strongest skill; he’s a lousy defender but compensated for that by roaming up – while the defense was protected by Kessié; he can no longer do it), he’s unmotivated due to the lack of ambition that the team owner and managers express (a player of his level craves trophies and Theo won’t be get any with the current Milan), and he isn’t happy that his mentor and idol Paolo Maldini was kicked out of the team in a disrespectful manner.  Theo is self-sabotaging his career at Milan, is clearly unhappy and unmotivated, and therefore I bet he won’t be staying. Which, all things considered, is a shame. We don’t even have a deputy for him; much less, a worthy replacement.  Sure, his staying in his current state of mind won’t do any good to the team and to himself. He’s so unmotivated that he has turned into a liability rather than an asset, so partying ways is likely to be better for both Milan and Theo. I’m prepared to bet that once Theo leaves for greener pastures, he will recover his form and will play at a high level again. The current owner, managers, and head coach have torpedoed Theo’s career at Milan, and we are seeing the consequences of the mismanagement: from being a huge contributor to our victories, he became a contributor to our losses and a very poor example for his teammates. At this point, I understand that Theo and Milan are no longer a marriage made in heaven; I wish Theo good luck in his next endeavor. And I hope that soon enough, the idiot we have as the owner, the clowns we have as managers, and the loser we have as head coach will leave the team – unfortunately, not before worsening even more the already striking damage they have inflicted on the club. Would you all stop this management is the devil “that makes or causes every issues with the players doing their job wrongly”  their fault.  You said it yourself that his form is his own doing, and he is self sabotaging his career at Milan. How’s that the management fault?  My question to you is ” Is Theo AC Milan or is AC Milan Theo?  Musah is asked from Stef to Fonseca to play out of position and he does it with a good attitude. Even the futuro are asked the same thing to but why can’t Theo do the same?  I still don’t buy that defense point you guys give that he is no good at defending. That in itself is a big lie. Recall when Stef asked him to play CB, we all marvel that he could defend well, so how much more now that he is asked to put or step up his defense game in his own position? Is it not ironic that we demand our RB to be good defensively and offensively? So why can’t we demand that from our LB? While under Stef, we complained about the players attitude and we are still doing the same today. How’s that the management fault. Let’s call a spade a spade when it’s required. For this leave the management out, when it’s their turn we would come for them, but not today. True words! Nope. Since the good days of Theo with Milan, it’s the managers that changed. Theo is still Theo. Therefore, yes, it’s the managers’ fault. Like I said, they sacked his idol and mentor, they showed little ambition to win trophies which a player of his level can’t fail to get frustrated about, and they hired a loser of a head coach who doesn’t understand Theo’s strengths. While I never failed to also say that Theo has been unprofessional and has sabotaged himself, I still think that it’s mostly the manager’s fault. And no, you don’t get to tell me to stop saying what I think. Who do you think you are to try to control what I think and say? Mind your own business. Say what you think, but don’t try to control and censor what others think and say. Firstly Luigi, you did not answer my question.  Secondly, let’s start from it’s the managers that has changed. Theo was brought in by his mentor as you say with the likes of rafa, bennecer. He has played under 3 managers so far, 1st giampaolo whom played 7 games or so before he was sacked, then Stef, and now Fonseca, so if you say it’s the managers fault that’s delusion in your side.  Thirdly, you keep saying they sacked his mentor been part of his self sabotage is laughable. His mentor played under how many managers and is still regarded as one of the best AC MILAN PLAYER TO EVER DON ON OUR JERSEY because he had an attitude of I bled for this badge, I bled for this club that’s why he is a legend, but his protege is the opposite. A change of manager and he is this lackluster to do his job professionally. And that is on the manager? Nah bro, it’s on him not the club and neither the manager.  Fourthly, And no, you don’t get to tell me to mind my business. Who do you think you are to try to control what I think and say? Say what you think but please be constructive about it. Lol Managers. I’m not saying head coach. I said managers as in the club officials that manage the club. You are talking about a bunch of head coaches, I’m taking about ownership/managers.  Oh how funny you are… YOU aggressively address what I said, and when I react you think I’m doing the same thing that you were doing. YOU started it, buddy, Now, get lost. I won’t be replying to your ridiculous posts any longer. The guy needs a bit of rest here and there, that’s basically it. Theo is one of our top players, and still one of the best LB in the world. Fonseca needs to utilize him better, and not create drama as he does week day and week out. Your email address will not be published.

In the 58th minute the home side took the lead after Milan had missed chances earlier in the game to go ahead, but Daniele Bonera’s side were rightly furious about the first goal. Lapo Nava went down after taking a knock to the head and instead of the referee Gangi blowing play dead as he should have done, the game went on and Okoro scored. With 13 minutes left the Rossoneri got themselves level through Samuele Longo. Diego Sia met a cross from the left and headed towards goal, but it fell to Longo who deflected it in. However, parity would last for just 10 minutes as Vis Pesaro scored a winner through Cannavo. It was a brilliant curling right-footed shot that went in off the far post. After the win against Gubbio one week ago there was hope that the Futuro would be able to build into a good run of form, but sadly they have taken another step backwards and remain in a relegation battle. I don’t think the results have been good from the futuro team. We are losing both left and  right. What’s d matter ??? This management needs to go ! Clearly there is something they are not doing right . please fire Bonera… he done enough… Send Bonera to f’ing Valhalla. what a bust that we hired him instead of promoting Abate to the Futuro.

According to what is being reported by La Gazzetta dello Sport (via PianetaMilan), the game between Lecce and Monza will not just be a relegation battle but also a showcase for a couple of talents, namely Patrick Dorgu and Bondo. Antonio Conte’s Napoli are pursuing Dorgu strongly and seem willing to pay up to €30m to get him as early as the January window. However, Lecce’s technical director Pantaleo Corvino has already made it known that he will not move for less than €40m. Bondo, on the other hand, is especially liked by Milan, who already followed him during his time in France and tried to sign him. Atalanta are also keen on signing him though, so there is competition from a team that at the moment are comfortably higher in the table. Even if a big offer were to arrive, Monza’s CEO Adriano Galliani will not let him leave before June. There is even less chance given that they are struggling under Alessandro Nesta and are currently second-last in the Serie A table. I’m more confident about a successful deal here (if we are truly interested in him that is) not necessarily because I believe in our management but because Uncle Fester is at the helm at Monza. Say what you will, but the Man is and will and will always be a Milanista through and through so I realty don’t fear any competition from Atalanta or anyone else for a Player at Monza we want. This unfortunately says more about who we have holding our reins than anything else to be honest.  In other news, anyone else genuinely worried about the fact that we might f*ck up and lose a game on our 125th Anniversary and after all the elaborate celebrations/in the process have our current crop sour the moment for our legends in attendance tonight? I swear; supporting Ac Milan is nothing short of pure drama! Lol Thing is if genoa gets a draw that’s a good result for them. For us only victory will do.
So they really are coming here with nothing to lose meanwhile the pressure is on our team. And they sùck under pressure in “smoll” games. Your email address will not be published.

There is no doubting that Pulisic has established himself as one of the most important players at Milan since arriving from Chelsea in the summer 2023 window, racking up 23 goals and 17 assists in 70 games. It is understandable, therefore, that clubs are starting to take note and a recent report suggested that he has ended up in Liverpool’s sights to replace Mo Salah, in the event of the Egyptian’s farewell at the end of the season (his contract expires at the end of the season). According to what is being reported by Matteo Moretto of Relevo, there is an ‘agreement in the process of being defined’ between Milan and Pulisic for a contract extension. The new deadline should be 2028 with an option for an extra year, or until 2029 with no option. The American’s salary will be raised as a result, going to around €4-5m net per season. Pulisic currently has a contract with the Rossoneri until 2027, with an option to renew for another year, and everything suggests that he is happy at the club that has helped him rediscover his best form. €5M a year seems like a bargain compared to his impact not only on the field but also tv ratings and jersey sales. His puma contract estimated to be less than $10m a year.  Not feeling badly for him but mid tier NBA players make $20m+ a year days. American sports teams in the top 3 leagues (NFL, NBA and MLB) average much higher revenues than the vast majority of European football clubs, thanks to overcommercialization and profit sharing. I doubt Europeans would be OK paying 20 euro for a watery beer or over 100 euro for a seat in the nosebleeds even when it’s not a marquee matchup. Those leagues also have zero competition for their audiences, so they max out their TV distribution rights and for the same reasons advertising income is exponential. A baseball player just signed a 3/4 billion dollar contract over 10 years. That’s 75m per year to hit a ball with a stick. It’s only a matter of time (within the next 5 years) that we’ll see the first 1bn contract. This seems a no-brainer, really for both sides. Pulisic thrives in Milan and that’s good for everybody. I don’t think he should go back to the Prem. Yes, he has much more lower body strength now, but it’s a brutal league and I think he’d be injured more there than in Serie A. I could see him going to Madrid or Barca, since he grew up idolizing those teams, but I can’t see him wanting to leave for anywhere else unless a manager with a new philosophy came in and did not play him. And that’s really only going to happen if you get a manager who wants wingbacks and a more physically imposing attacking midfield. But Leao fits that vision even worse than Pulisic. Please keep in mind that, especially with a favorable compensation package for any acquiring team, the added length of a new agreement also will allow Milan to command a larger transfer fee.  Puli thrives with Milan, and it would be wonderful to see him grow into a club legend. I thought Pulisic was already making €5M a year, which was less than he was making at Chelsea.

As Calciomercato.com write, Mattia Liberali and Alex Jimenez are expected to start tonight while Davide Bartesaghi, Silvano Vos and Francesco Camarda have also been summoned Fonseca, with the hopes that the Futuro project is doing them well. Then there is Stalmach, who was already a protagonist in the Polish top flight when he was just 16. Milan signed him from Gornik Zabzre and after an excellent start with the Rossoneri Primavera – especially in the UEFA Youth League – he had lost his way a bit. The Pole was not initially part of the Milan Futuro squad and thus remained in the Primavera but with a different spirit. He began to be more decisive, to take on responsibilities and to make a difference together with his close friend Maximilian Ibrahimovic. Stalmach’s growth was immediately rewarded by Daniele Bonera who decided to bring him back into the fold, and he repaid this faith with a goal in the recent away match against Campobasso. Now, Fonseca is also studying him for the First team because he has all the credentials to play for Milan. He is a dynamic midfielder who has quality and works hard, he is most natural as a mezzala in a three-man midfield and he makes good attacking runs into the box. In terms of characteristics, there are those who have ‘compared him to Sandro Tonali’. High praise, even if there is plenty of work to do. Stalmach and Milan will go one step at a time because everyone develops at their own rate, but Liberali and Jimenez starting tonight would show that age is irrelevant if the talent is there. Mattia Liberali, Alex Jimenez, Davide Bartesaghi, Stalmach, Zeroli, Sia, Hozdic and Francesco Camarda Fifa simp IncelTurtle… :)) Oh yeah just like Tonali, a life long Milan fan and Italian. Any good Primavera players just need to look at Simic.
Scored on his 1st game. Played well without any big mistakes in all his 1st team games, star of the Primavera, who reached European final. Sold for 3m The Futuro project is a joke. These top young guys DO NOT want to play in Serie C!!! The project started not even 6 months ago and it’s already a joke in this instant gratification time.
Fagioli, Miretti, Soule, Illang Junior, Huijsen, Yildiz all played in serie C for Juventus Next Gen before they were introduced with the 1st team or SOLD for profit. Juventus started their Next Gen “joke” project 6 years ago not 6 months ago.
But, but but Jan Carlo Simic thought because of 1 good game he should be a starter for the first team and was too good to play few games in serie C. Is that why they keep losing in Serie C? Too easy for them? Or is it Bonera? Is Stalmach considered Milan-Trained?
If so, then he’ll be immensely useful even after he turns 21 and beyond. Tonali? A benchwarmer in midtable PL club? No thanks. /s Your email address will not be published.

During his pre-match presser, Paulo Fonseca stated that his harsh words after the Red Star were needed, so now the pressure is on the team to provide a response. ➤ Milan have lost just one of their last 13 league matches against Genoa (W9 D3); the Rossoblu’s only success in this period was in March 2020 (2-1), with goals scored by Goran Pandev and Francesco Cassata (Zlatan Ibrahimovic for the Rossoneri). ➤ Genoa drew their last away match at San Siro against Milan in Serie A (3-3), after having lost five of their previous seven (W1 D1); the last time the Rossoblu drew two or more consecutive away games against the Rossoneri in the Italian top-flight dates back to 1981 (three draws in a row on that occasion).

  ➤ Milan have scored at least two goals in eight of their last 10 league games against Genoa, as many times as in the previous 36. ➤ Genoa are unbeaten in their last five league matches (W2 D3), keeping three clean sheets in the period; the last time they played more games in a row without losing in the Italian top-flight was between December 2023 and February 2024 (eight). ➤ Milan have kept a clean sheet in five of their seven home Serie A matches this season; the last time the Rossoneri recorded more clean sheets after the first eight home games played in the Italian top flight was in 2002/03 (seven on that occasion). ➤ Genoa won each of their last two Serie A away games without conceding any goal; the last time they found three successes in a row away from home in the competition was in November 2014, while the last time they recorded three consecutive away clean sheets was in February 2021. ➤ All of Milan’s last 12 Serie A goals have been scored from open play, the last time the Rossoneri recorded a longer run of goals in the competition without scoring one from a set piece was between October 2022 and January 2023 (14). ➤ Since Patrick Vieira started managing Genoa, they record an average of 447 passes, 13 shots taken and 10.3 shots conceded per game – all better averages than in the first 12 games of the current tournament under the management of Alberto Gilardino (326, 10.9 and 14.3 respectively). ➤ Genoa are, alongside Udinese, one of the two teams that Milan’s Rafael Leão has faced at least five times in Serie A without being involved in more than one goal (only one goal for him against this opponent); the Portuguese player has been involved in three goals in his last four league appearances (all played as starter), just one less than he did in his first nine games played in the current tournament. ➤ Mario Balotelli could return to play at San Siro in Serie A more than eight years after the last time (14 May 2016, Milan-Roma); the Genoa player did not score in the three matches against Milan in the Italian top-flight (all as a substitute) and in this tournament he is one of the six forwards with at least five appearances without having a shot on target (along with Gabrielloni, Vignato, Maric, Arnautovic and Felici).

Earlier in the week, a report from La Gazzetta dello Sport suggested that Tonali is feeling a bit unhappy with his situation at Newcastle and is already thinking about coming back to Serie A, with Milan naturally mentioned as a potential destination. However, Eddie Howe replied to the reports in a press conference this week and stated that there was no intention of letting the midfielder leave, at least not yet. “It’s not in our plans to do without Sandro. These are rumours that make me laugh. Sandro is a vital part of what we are doing, we have made a long-term investment in him and personally, I am really happy with him, we have built a solid relationship,” he said. Now, Matteo Moretto has given an update on Tonali during a column for Relevo, denying any possibility that the Italian is pushing to go back to his home country. “Keep an eye on the situation of an Italian player, Sandro Tonali. The Newcastle midfielder has been at the centre of several transfer rumours in the last week, and I would like to say what I know: there are no plans for a transfer before January,” he said. “Tonali is currently only thinking about Newcastle and is not considering returning to Italy. The tangible proof is the performance that Tonali offered yesterday in the match against Leicester, an immediate response to the rumours with a top performance.” Maybe in 2027. Doubt they’ll sell him before that unless he becomes real bad. And if he plays real bad would we even want him back? Yeah I agree I could see that 2027 could be the year for a possible return with one year on his contract. Highly unlikely to happen before that if ever.
He doesnt play badly from what I’ve seen but if the team keeps struiggling maybe they could be forced to sell some of their players at some point so who knows what might happen.¨
Anywho I would welcome him back. Tonali has become best pair with Bruno.
Tonali is solving the problems that the current team facing with defensive teams and dmf problem to play Bruno more in the attack. All players admit he’s very good and he control the rhythem of the match. No way he is leaving or Newcastle want to sell him. these are perfect rumours Your email address will not be published.

It has been yet another turbulent last few days for Milan, following on from Paulo Fonseca’s decision to criticise the attitudes of certain members of the team after the win against Red Star on Wednesday. That generated enough headlines on its own, as did the decision from the directors to not make their presence felt at Milanello the next day, which some perceived to be leaving the coach alone. What it means is that Milan are going into their birthday celebrations with a dark cloud overhanging, and not just because of the poor results in the league to this point either. Longoni spoke in his weekly column for MilanNews published on the day of the 125th anniversary celebration game against Genoa, and he picked apart why the current management are failing. “It will be a party tonight, but it will certainly not be celebrated in a historical period to be framed, on the contrary. It will come at the end of a hectic week, yet another. This time for the sensational outburst from Fonseca after the Red Star game,” he began. “A few months have passed since the start of the season, but it seems like a year for everything that has happened. Cooling break deserted, gestures to silence the crowd, anarchy on penalties, punitive benches, anger towards a substitution: everything and more, seasoned with too many defeats and too few points won. “In the background, a management that is too often absent and detached from what should be the real focus, that is, the pitch. The absence from Milanello the day after the coach’s harsh public attack on the team, cries out for vengeance. “Justifying it by explaining that they did not want to delegitimise the coach is even worse. Fonseca was delegitimised when Ibra met with the team in the dressing room without him, or when he himself put him in a corner in a press conference (“I decide when the market ends”), or when Saelemaekers was sold, whose confirmation had been loudly requested by the coach. “An intervention on Thursday at Milanello would have been a must to reinforce his thinking, but instead the management opted out, which also happened in the famous episode of the cooling break, defined by Furlani as a ‘non-event’. “The players are to blame, the coach is to blame, but the main problem is upstream. Almost worse than Fassone and Mirabelli: they had inherited a disastrous Milan, unlike the current management… It will be a celebration, but many protagonists will be missing, among the most important. “Some weren’t even invited: a lack of style and respect for the history of these colours. Not inviting Rivera is something that is neither here nor there, despite the dispute over image rights. Not inviting Boban, equally. “Just like having the invitation delivered to Maldini not from the upper levels, like any warehouse worker (with the utmost respect). It will be a party, but a great piece of the great Milan will be missing. A party where the birthday boy is almost gone…” Scathing, true and sad. And unfortunately there seems to be no end in sight as none of these managers are going anywhere. Oh but they will go! The main worry now becomes “WHEN”, and “IN WHAT STATE” will Milan be when they do Continued mismanagement always translates into loss of revenue and fall of the market value of any business. A time comes and the ‘managers’ responsible for the mismanagement have to cut their losses.  The current owners are in even a worse scenario, seeing they have a debt owed to the previous owners to pay. Ability to pay it is directly determined how successfully they run the club, otherwise they will soon throw in the towel. I don’t think it’s simply a coincidence that since RedBird took over and started looking for new investment partners, no major partnership has been named!! Ear-to-the-ground kind of sign. Exactly! I’ve been saying the same. A newspaper article has recently expressed the rumor (collected from the United States which makes it more credible, not from Italy) that Gerry Cardinale is already thinking of cutting his losses and allowing Milan to be repossessed by Elliott, as soon as in February 2025, because he won’t be able to pay the vendor’s loan before the deadline. He looked for investors or share buyers to be able to pay back the loan, but could find neither, because of how he thoroughly destroyed the Milan brand.  The “winning is boring” man never understood that without results on the pitch, no investors or buyers would want a club in frank decline who is not even likely to make the next UCL, which means that revenues for the club would be kept at a minimum.  Congratulations, Gerry! You thought that hiring a cheap coach, putting a low cap on money for each new signing of not more than about 20M, and keeping a low cap for players salaries at about 7M, would balance your books and get your property to be more desirable for investors.  Yep, the books have been balanced all right, but you forgot that by doing that, Milan would fall (and has fallen) into being a mid-table team with no European competition, which pretty much cancels investor interest.  A European football team is not just a financial sheet; it relies on victories and trophies to thrive financially, and to get into lucrative competitions, attract new fans, and sell merchandise. Often fans have several options to root for, with more than one major teams for each market and also national followers of teams even when they are not residents of that market. Lose consistently, and you lose those fans. What Gerry hasn’t understood is that Italian and European football don’t have the same structure of American leagues like the NFL and MLB, where even franchises that are doing very poorly on the field are still very profitable. A recent example: even the lowly NFL team Carolina Panthers, one of the worst NFL teams that hasn’t achieved any seasonal success in years, and hasn’t qualified for the league playoffs in years, is still one of the most profitable sports clubs in the world, according to a recent survey by Forbes magazine. The Carolinas (North and South) don’t have any other football team, so if fans are unhappy with how the Panthers perform on the field, they will still remain with the team for lack of other options. The American leagues have a draft system that delivers to the worst teams, the best recruits for the next season, so that the league remains relatively balanced, and losing consistently can actually make you improve your roster for the following season so that you can win again. Losing teams keep their fans, who know that and wait for better times in relatively short time frames. The last placed league team is not relegated; instead, they qualify for hiring the top prospect in the draft. They are actually rewarded for being bad. Well, there is no such system in European football. If you lose consistently, you fall down the drains and you don’t recover as easily (see the banter years). Then, you can’t hire the best players because they have no interest in playing for a team that is not in the Champions League, and you also see your best players asking to leave, in these circumstances (which is rarely the case in American leagues). So, Gerry thought that winning wasn’t important and his club would still be profitable. Well, not really, Gerry. Unlike the NFL where there is no promotion or relegation and year after year even the horrible teams continue to compete at that same level, which is the highest level because there is no supra-national competition, in European football you need to qualify for the UCL or at least the Europa League to remain profitable, and for this, yep, winning is not boring or optional; winning is essential. The thing is, if Gerry Cardinale was that unfamiliar with how European football works, he should have hired competent managers who are experienced with football, know the environment, and know what they are doing, Instead, he named a bunch of clowns to manage the team, and we are seeing the disastrous result. Good riddance, Gerry. Don’t let the door hit you on your way out. Your email address will not be published.

Atalanta top the standings on 34 points, two ahead of Antonio Conte's Napoli, with Inter and Fiorentina both one point further back on 31. Reeling from Tuesday's 1-0 loss at Bayer Leverkusen, Simone Inzaghi's side remain without injured defensive pillars Francesco Acerbi and Benjamin Pavard ahead of Monday's visit to his former club. Inter's 573-minute run without conceding a goal in the Champions League ended when Nordi Mukiele scored for Leverkusen in the 90th minute on Tuesday. That capped a miserable trip to Germany for Inter, who failed to record a single shot on target in a Champions League game for the first time since February 2022 (versus Liverpool), and for the first time on record (since 2003-04) in the competition's first round.  Lazio, meanwhile, have racked up consecutive victories over Napoli in league and cup, with the Biancocelesti facing Ajax in the Europa League on Thursday before returning to Serie A action. Inter could be six points off the top by the time they take to the field for that headline fixture, with Atalanta targeting a piece of history at Cagliari on Saturday. Gian Piero Gasperini's Dea side have won nine straight Serie A games to equal their club record, having also won nine in a row between February and July 2020. Another victory would make this their best-ever winning run in the competition. This is only the second time that Atalanta have topped the table at the end of a Serie A matchday since the competition returned to 20 teams in 2004-05, having only managed to do so after the fifth matchday in 2022-23. Until now, Atalanta had never led the top-flight table as many as 15 matches into a campaign. They are big favourites to maintain their winning streak against 15th-placed Cagliari, with Gasperini having no new injury concerns. Giorgio Scalvini is out, having sustained a shoulder injury ahead of Tuesday's Champions League 3-2 loss to Real Madrid, while Gianluca Scamacca and Juan Cuadrado are longer-term absentees. While both Inter and Atalanta were beaten in Europe this week, Juventus claimed a huge result by beating Manchester City 2-0, courtesy of goals from Dusan Vlahovic and Weston McKennie. The Bianconeri's triumph came despite them only having 31% of possession – only once previously on record (since 2003-04) have they won a Champions League game while having a lower share of possession (27% versus Chelsea in September 2021).  In Serie A, however, it has been a case of possession without purpose for Juventus, who remain unbeaten but have drawn nine of their 15 matches, including each of their last three, to sit sixth. ""Nothing bothers me. I perfectly accept all honest judgements, but I won't enter this story,"" Juve coach Thiago Motta said, when asked about criticism of their domestic form. ""I am only focused on my work: improving the team and helping my players. The rest doesn’t count much."" With last-placed Venezia travelling to Turin on Saturday, Motta should be confident of maintaining the feel-good factor built in midweek.  Juventus have dominated this fixture historically, winning 10 of their last 12 Serie A matches against the newly promoted side. Surprise package Fiorentina, meanwhile, are riding high on an eight-match winning streak in Serie A, and they could make history when they travel to Bologna – led by former Viola boss Vincenzo Italiano – on Sunday.

Real won 3-2, thanks to two important goals in the second half from Vinicius Junior and Jude Bellingham. Ademola Lookman had pulled one back to make it 3-2 but he created a vital chance in the 94th minute of the game, but Matteo Retegui somehow missed from point blank range. In the first half, Kylian Mbappe’s goal was cancelled out by Charles de Ketelaere’s penalty in stoppage time. After the game, Gian Piero Gasperini spoke to Sky about the loss and he was happy about the showing. He said, as relayed by TMW: “Both teams wanted to play, trying to win with their strength. For us there is a bit of disappointment, but we learn something from these games. We still lack something, but it is also a reason to improve and work. We come out defeated, even if maybe not in numbers and this will help us to take a small step forward.” Speaking of where La Dea could have done better, the Italian said:  “We were moving a little too slowly, these teams close down well. We held the game well, but we could have been more dangerous because we could have been. A game that will be a great lesson, we are sorry to have lost but we will bounce back from these games.” Atalanta are ninth in the Champions League table and have every chance of going through to the next round. They are also top of the Serie A.           Kaustubh Pandey I GIFN @2024 - All Rights Reserved. Get Football Group",

However, he hasn’t had any room with the first team during the regular season, and he has struggled to find his footing with the Futuro squad in Serie C too. According to Calciomercato, the Rossoneri are mulling the future of the starlet, whose contract runs out in 2026. It’s not so certain it’ll be with them, as he would like to be given a real shot. Atalanta and Fiorentina have shown interest and would be ready to pounce if he became available. Milan will have to make the call about Liberali next summer given the expiration date of his deal. The extension talks haven’t gone far due to his challenging season. He was named among the 60 most promising youngsters in the world by The Guardian. The 17-year-old hasn’t received consistent minutes in the Daniele Bonera-led team. He last appeared on October 30th and hasn’t been called up in the past month. He’s been sent back to the Primavera side, where he’s starring domestically and in the Youth League. The youngster has scored once in each competition. He also hit the net in his first match in the Coppa Italia Serie C but didn’t produce in seven appearances in the third division. Paulo Fonseca selected him twice without fielding him. His contract is more of a factor than his displays, as he’s super young and has all the time in the world to improve. Still, it’d be quite ludicrous if he didn’t resume playing regularly with the Futuro team. Your email address will not be published.

Charles De Ketelaere is in exceptional form having registered 12 direct goal contributions in his last eight games (all comps) including a goal in the 2-1 win over former club AC Milan that sent Atalanta top of Serie A.

Juan Cuadrado, Gianluca Scamacca and Davide Zappacosta will all be unavailable for Atalanta’s home match against Real Madrid on Tuesday. Otherwise, Gasperini has a fully fit squad to choose from. Retegui could come back into the lineup after starting the win over AC Milan on the bench, although Mario Pašalić could keep his place after impressing. Vinícius could make a return from injury, but David Alaba, Eduardo Camavinga, Dani Carvajal, Ferland Mendy and Éder Militão remain unavailable for Real Madrid.

Plenty is at stake, considering both teams desperately need three points to consolidate their hopes of securing automatic knockout qualification Atalanta head into proceedings in a buoyant mood after leapfrogging Napoli at the Serie A table’s summit over the weekend. Friday’s 2-1 home triumph against Milan saw Gian Piero Gasperini’s side open up a two-point gap at the top while extending their winning streak in all competitions to an eye-catching nine matches. Keen to build on last season’s UEFA Europa League success, Atalanta boast an impressive five-game unbeaten start to the newly formatted league phase (W3, D2). Despite commencing this round in fifth, the Italians can’t afford to rest on their laurels, with ninth-placed Aston Villa only one point adrift.  Visiting Real Madrid would gladly trade places with Atalanta after back-to-back defeats to Milan and Liverpool significantly derailed their chances of securing automatic qualification. Carlo Ancelotti’s charges, stuck in 24th in the 36-team table, trail eighth-placed Monaco by four points, meaning there’s virtually no margin for error in Bergamo.  Los Blancos regained lost confidence in the build-up to this trip with a landslide 3-0 victory at Girona on Saturday, whittling down the gap on La Liga leaders Barcelona to only two points. More importantly, out-of-sorts superstar Kylian Mbappe returned to the scoresheet after missing consecutive penalties against Athletic Bilbao and Liverpool. Atalanta Poised to avenge a 2-0 defeat in August’s UEFA Super Cup, Atalanta will be out to seize the momentum and potentially land a knockout blow on Real Madrid’s quest to secure automatic qualification. However, that task is nothing short of Herculean, with La Dea losing both previous Champions League meetings against the reigning European champions, including a narrow 1-0 loss on this ground. Atalanta’s overall home record against Spanish opposition can’t inspire much confidence either (W1, L2). On top of that, both their home matches in this season’s league phase have ended scoreless, even though Gasperini’s team generated a promising 1.75 xG or better on both occasions. However, Arsenal and Celtic stood firm at the Gewiss Stadium. Young Boys couldn’t follow in their footsteps as Charles De Ketelaere’s incredible performance inspired Atalanta to a thumping 6-1 triumph in Bern. Indeed, the Belgian forward contributed to five goals against the Swiss side, forming part of Atalanta’s sterling run of scoring 2+ goals in their last nine competitive outings. Real Madrid Real Madrid’s chances of avoiding a knockout phase playoff place look slim after Ancelotti’s men suffered three defeats across the opening five matchdays (W2). Los Merengues find themselves in uncharted territory ahead of the kick-off. Two-goal margin reverses to Milan and Liverpool put them at risk of losing three consecutive games in the same Champions League season for the first time in club history.  Oddly enough for a team of their stature, Real Madrid’s last five competitive fixtures have fluctuated between victories (3) and defeats (2), with four of those five results yielding a 2+ goal margin and seeing the winner on the day keeping a clean sheet. Therefore, breaking the deadlock could be a match-defining moment.  Topically, Real Madrid had conceded first in back-to-back away defeats before putting Girona to the sword at the weekend. However, it’s worth noting that they’ve lost both Champions League games on the road this season without scoring, which paints a bleak picture for Ancelotti’s underperforming crop of superstars.  In addition to long-term absentee Gianluca Scamacca, Atalanta boss Gasperini can’t call upon the services of experienced wingbacks Juan Cuadrado and Davide Zappacosta. All eyes will be on Mateo Retegui, Ademola Lookman, and De Ketealere as Gasperini’s formidable trio continues to tear opposition defenses at will. As for Real Madrid, Ancelotti faces a selection nightmare, lacking several significant defensive pieces. Davide Alaba, Dani Carvajal, Eder Militao, and Ferland Mendy are unavailable for Tuesday’s trip. Furthermore, Eduardo Camavinga is on the sidelines with a thigh injury. Atalanta (3-4-2-1): Carnesecchi; Djimsiti, Hien, Kolasinac; Bellanova, De Roon, Ederson, Ruggeri; De Ketelaere, Retegui, Lookman. Real Madrid (4-3-3): Courtois; Vazquez, Tchouameni, Rudiger, F Garcia; Valverde, Bellingham, Modric; Rodrygo, Mbappe, Vinicius. As one of the most in-form teams in Europe, Atalanta can realistically hope to topple the record-time European champions. Though Real Madrid are in a dire situation and can ill-afford a slip-up, we expect Gasperini’s free-firing squad to pour more misery on Ancelotti’s star-studded line-up.

Perhaps it was meant to be, as the Belgian helped his side beat Milan and helped La Dea go to the top of the table until Napoli play later in the week. The player had struggled at Milan but has thrived at Atalanta under Gian Piero Gasperini since last season and after the game, he was asked by Sky Italia as to what is the difference between his usage at Bergamo and how Stefano Pioli used him to at Milan. He said, as relayed by MilanNews: “There are several things. Everyone thinks it’s just one but it’s not like that. The first is because I had been in Italy for a year longer but also the way I play: I stand taller and play more freely, I feel more important during the match.” Speaking specifically about his usage against Milan yesterday, the versatile forward said: “The tactic depends a bit on the opponent: today I played against Thiaw but I had to go a bit wide to create space. I feel good when I can go a bit outside.” He has contributed to eight league goals this season, scoring three times and picking up five assists. Last season, De Ketelaere had scored ten goals and had racked up eight assists.         Kaustubh Pandey I GIFN @2024 - All Rights Reserved. Get Football Group",

Despite holding up his end of the bargain, the Spaniard couldn’t help the Rossoneri avoid defeat at the Gewiss Stadium. “We knew that Atalanta were a great team, but we were defending well and conceded two goals from dead-ball situations, which usually isn’t a weakness for us,” Morata told Sky Sport after the game, as reported by MilanNews. “We can only correct our errors and keep going.  “We have many objectives and competitions, including the Supercoppa Italiana coming up soon.“ Milan have been notoriously inconsistent under Paulo Fonseca this season. That’s one of the reasons they’re out of the Scudetto picture already in December, as Morata tried to explain Rossoneri’s collapse in Bergamo.  “Because we are always playing against top-level opponents. If you don’t keep totally focused in every situation, you risk defeat,” the Milan ace continued. “We conceded two goals from set plays, and if you are not paying enough attention, then it all becomes more complicated.  “At the end of the day, there’s always something that doesn’t work as it should. Sometimes we do well in certain areas, then are penalized in different ones. We just need to work on all the different areas that involve football.

However, he couldn’t help but hail Atalanta fans for their raucous support during last night’s game. “It has never happened before that fans sang such a chant. We have never been at the top of the table after so many matches; let them sing.“ Charles De Ketelaere maintained his red-hot form with an early opener, scoring against his former club to set the tone for a precious victory.

Another disappointing result leaves the Rossoneri a whopping ten points adrift of table-topping Napoli, who will take on Lazio on Sunday. Christian Pulisic could’ve fired Milan in front only a few seconds into the game, but Marco Carnesecchi thwarted his close-range effort. Buoyed by their goalkeeper’s early heroics, Atalanta grabbed the lead in the 12th minute through former Rossoneri flop Charles De Ketelaere.  It took Milan ten minutes to equal the score as Rafael Leao breezed past Raoul Bellanova before serving Alvaro Morata on a platter. The Spaniard tapped home from a couple of yards out to secure parity at the halftime interval.  Following an enthralling first half, both sides took their feet off the pedal in the second half, resulting in a chess game for most of the second 45 minutes. However, Paulo Fonseca’s decision to settle for a draw backfired on Milan as Ademola Lookman scored a late winner for Atalanta. Milan paid the ultimate price for an incomprehensible second-half approach as we look at our player ratings.  Mike Maignan – 6.5 De Ketelaere’s close-range header left the French goalkeeper powerless, but he made several vital saves to help Milan avoid a more devastating loss in Bergamo. Theo Hernandez – 5 It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say this was one of his least impressive performances in the Milan shirt. In addition to being outjumped by the Belgian forward, he was quiet in attack, especially in the second half. Malick Thiaw – 6.5 Despite his see-saw form since returning from injury, the German talent held his ground against Serie A’s top-scorer Mateo Retegui.  Matteo Gabbia – 7 Particularly dominant in the air, the homegrown Rossoneri defender enjoyed a near-flawless game, even though Milan conceded twice.  Emerson Royal – 5.5 When it looked like the Brazilian was finding his feat, he returned to old habits of being completely useless in attack while losing sight of Lookman for Atalanta’s second. Youssouf Fofana – 6 The Frenchman’s commendable defensive effort wasn’t insufficient to atone for a near-anonymous offensive role. He needs to take more responsibility in the build-up! Tijjani Reijnders – 5.5 It was a rare night off from the free-firing midfielder. The most creative Milan player was nowhere to be found at the Gewiss Stadium. Yunus Musah – 6 Fonseca’s conservative approach with the USMNT star as a winger didn’t pay off this time, as Musah couldn’t do anything noteworthy in the final third. Christian Pulisic – 6.5 Although he failed to score from a promising position in the first half, his withdrawal toward the end of the first half showed how significant he is to Milan’s attack. They did nothing without their talismanic forward. Rafael Leao – 6 Except for a blistering run before setting up Morata for the goal, the Portuguese winger struggled to impact the game, especially after the break.  Alvaro Morata – 6.5 Scored one and had another one disallowed for offside, the Euro 2024 winner did his part tonight, but his teammates let him down, denying him proper service in the box.  Ruben Loftus-Cheek – 6 Tammy Abraham – 5 Samuel Chukwueze – N/A Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked * Comment *  Name *  Email *  Website

The Brianzoli, which are already thin in the midfield, have earmarked Cesare Casadei as a potential replacement. According to Tuttomercatoweb, the Rossoneri have done a lot of homework on the youngster. They had already tracked him when he was at Rennes in 2021. There were some contacts to bring him in, but he elected to go to a smaller team in his first Serie A stop. CEO Adriano Galliani scooped him up on a free transfer. Milan could target Bondo in January already, while Atalanta and Inter are more interested for the summer. La Dea is starting to look for a potential heir to Ederson, whose sale would fetch a major figure. Moreover, they could use a Marten de Roon deputy, as Ibrahima Sulemana hasn’t convinced Gian Piero Gasperini so far. Monza won’t give the talent away but are open for business in case of a proper offer. Per Nicolò Schira, they are keen on Casadei. They have lost Matteo Pessina and Roberto Gagliardini to long-term thigh injuries. They’ll inquire with Chelsea about a potential loan. He’s a little sloppy with the ball in some matches, but he’s young and already fairly experienced, and he has a high ceiling. He’d be a swell choice as a Youssouf Fofana backup, and his price tag probably isn’t too lofty. He’d be a nice toy in Gian Piero Gasperini’s hands as he can still be molded. Monza need a new midfielder regardless. Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked * Comment *  Name *  Email *  Website

Unable to gather momentum since Paulo Fonseca’s arrival in the summer, last season’s runners-up head to the Gewiss Stadium, hoping to derail high-flying La Dea’s Scudetto hopes.  While Milan have been the epitome of inconsistency under Fonseca, Gian Piero Gasperini may have finally laid the groundwork for Atalanta’s first-ever title in Serie A. Seemingly buoyed by last season’s remarkable UEFA Europa League triumph, Gasperini’s charges are firing on all cylinders, raining down terror in all competitions.  Atalanta consolidated their title credentials with a well-deserved 2-0 triumph at Roma on Monday. In doing so, La Dea ramped up the pressure on pacesetters Napoli, re-establishing a one-point deficit pre-round. That also means that a win against Milan would see them ascend the Serie A throne, even if just for 48 hours. However, the Rossoneri will take the field in high spirits after stringing together three consecutive multi-goal margin victories across all competitions. Last weekend’s 3-0 home win against Empoli helped Fonseca’s team stay within striking distance of the European spots, trailing sixth-placed Juventus by four points. With a game in hand on most of the teams above them in the standings, Milan can still interfere in the UEFA Champions League race. But Fonseca’s dream of inspiring the San Siro outfit to a landmark 20th Scudetto looks like a pipe dream, with table-topping Napoli boasting a significant ten-point lead. Atalanta Atalanta could be the most in-form team in Europe’s top-five leagues alongside runaway Premier League leaders Liverpool. Gasperini’s men come into proceedings unbeaten in 13 matches across all competitions (W11, D2), including eight consecutive wins in the build-up to this heavyweight showdown.  Formidable goalscoring form has been the main ingredient behind Atalanta’s genuine Scudetto challenge this season. They have tallied a league-high 36 goals, netting at least two in 11 of their 14 Serie A outings thus far, including all six at the Gewiss Stadim. Given Milan’s defensive woes, Charles De Ketelaere and Ademola Lookman could have a field day. After a torrid spell at Milan, De Ketealere has gone from strength to strength at Atalanta, becoming one of Serie A’s deadliest forwards. Gasperini will need his Belgian talisman at his best to help La Dea defy an underwhelming run of just one win from their last four home league meetings with the Rossoneri (D1, L2).  Milan Stefano Pioli found a winning formula against Atalanta, but it took him a while. However, time is a luxury Fonseca cannot afford. He needs results, and he needs them now. Ominously for the Portuguese tactician, he failed to beat La Dea in all four matches as Roma boss (D1, L3).  Perhaps with Milan, he could turn his fortunes around. Fonseca’s side obliterated second-tier Sassuolo 6-1 in a one-sided Coppa Italia tie on Tuesday, setting themselves up nicely for this trip. It was the third consecutive game in all competitions to see Milan score 3+ goals.  Finding the net hasn’t been an issue for the Rossoneri, especially away from home. They’ve yet to draw a blank on the road, scoring on all six Serie A travels. It’s too bad their backline couldn’t keep up with the pace, conceding at least twice in four of those six games, hence a troubled away league record this season (W2, D2, L2).   Fonseca’s lads have developed a habit of packing a punch on this ground. They’ve bagged multiple goals on three of their last four top-flight visits to Bergamo, suggesting another impactful performance could be on the cards.  In addition to long-term absentee Gianluca Scamacca, Atalanta cannot call upon the services of veteran Juan Cuadrado, who slumped to a muscle problem against Roma. Wingback Davide Zapaccosta is on the verge of returning from injury, but Raoul Bellanova should be Gasperini’s first option on the right wing. On the other hand, Milan will hit the road without Alessandro Florenzi, Ismael Bennacer, and Luka Jovic. Ruben Loftus-Cheek sustained a minor fitness issue against Sassuolo and should move to the bench. The same goes for Tammy Abraham, who will likely surrender his place in attack to Alvaro Morata. Atalanta (3-4-2-1): Carnesecchi; Djimsiti, Hien, Kolasinac; Bellanova, Ederson, De Roon, Ruggeri; De Ketelaere, Lookman; Retegui.  Milan (4-2-3-1): Maignan; Emerson, Gabbia, Thiaw, Hernandez; Fofana, Reijnders; Chukwueze, Pulisic, Leao; Morata.  Anything other than three points would probably render Milan’s Scudetto hopes dead in the water. Therefore, all the pressure is on Fonseca’s side. Unfortunately, they couldn’t have picked a worse moment to trade tackles with Atalanta. Gasperini’s overachievers are in red-hot form and seem in far better shape than Milan. As such, we back La Dea to deliver a knockout blow on their visitors’ lofty domestic ambitions. Prediction: Atalanta to Win Your email address will not be published.

Yeah, it’s frustrating. It’s frustrating to see Juventus dropping points that they have no business dropping points to. Especially after landing their biggest win of the 2024-25 season on Wednesday against Manchester City in the Champions League.

   It really is quite mystifying when a game against the likes of Venezia goes the way it did on Saturday night. Juventus held nearly 70 percent of the possession, blocked nearly half of their opponent’s shots, and held their opponents under 85 percent pass completion. And yet, Venezia managed to take advantage of a pair of second-half lapses that saw their only two shots on target go into the goal. Juve needed a stoppage-time penalty — and a fluky one at that, thanks to Filip Stankovic’s parry of a shot by Francisco Conceição into his own teammate’s outstretched arm — in order to even claim the 2-2 draw that they escaped the Allianz Stadium with. But frustration ought not to breed panic. At least not yet. Given the crazy injury situation the club has been enduring the last month and a half, this is a team that is only just coming out of survival mode. It’s also one of the youngest teams in Serie A, and sometimes a lack of experience can cause some unsavory effects. Having expended what I imagine was quite a bit of mental and emotional capital against Man City, the team doesn’t have the experience to adjust for that in their next match — yet. I said early in the season that patience was necessary this season as a new Juventus took form to have patience. That’s true now even more now. But yeah, it’s still frustrating in the extreme. Thiago Motta was suspended for the game after being sent off last week against Bologna, so his top assistant Alexandre Hugeux filled in in the dugout. Nico Gonzalez returned to the bench for the first time since early October, but Andrea Cambiaso, Arkadiusz Milik, and Jonas Rouhi all missed out. The team stayed in its standard 4-2-3-1 formation, with Michele Di Gregorio propping it up. Nicolò Savona, Federico Gatti, Pierre Kalulu, and Danilo were arrayed in defense. Khephren Thuram was joined by Weston McKennie in the double pivot. Timothy Weah, Teun Koopmeiners, and Kenan Yildiz supported Dusan Vlahovic in attack. Venezia coach Eusebio Di Francesco was not only trying to get off the bottom of the league table, but also gain ground on the safe zone. He employed a 3-4-2-1 setup. Stankovic stood behind the back three of Michael Svoboda, Marin Sverko, and Jay Idzes. Francesco Zampano and Mikael Elertsson were the wing-backs, while Magnus Andersen partnered with old friend Hans Nicolussi Caviglia in midfield. Gianluca Busio and Gaetano Oristanio played in the hole behind Joel Pohjanpalo. Both teams jumped out of the starting gate, each one seeing a winger get to the byline and cross within the first 60 seconds of play. But despite that quick start, the opening moments of the game overall were cagey. Juve’s passing in the early phases looked a little crisper and more refined than it had for much of the season, although the quickness of the passes sometimes led to someone losing control and failing to continue the move. It was perhaps unsurprising in that context that Juve took the lead off a set piece. A near-post delivery by Koopmeiners found Thuram at the near post, who flicked it across goal to a waiting Gatti, who had brushed off Idzes and was completely open at the back stick to bury a poacher’s finish and give the home side the lead. They really ought to have had a second five minutes later when a mistake in Venezia’s defense let Vlahovic loose with the ball to charge at the goal. His shooting lane was perhaps cut off, but his attempt to put Yildiz in the clear on his left was a little bit behind him, forcing him to hold up and letting the defense get itself set. That was the story of the half for Juve — getting themselves into advantageous positions but unable to make any of them count. The best news was that Venezia were doing next to nothing with the ball, despite a large run of possession after Juve took the lead. The closest they came was when Andersen loaded up after a pull-back and hit a screamer from the top of the box, skimming it off the top of the bar. They thought they’d stretched their lead to something more comfortable within minutes of the restart. It was almost a carbon copy of the first goal. Thuram flicked on a corner and Yildiz got up to beat Nicolussi and headed it in under the bar. The jubilation, however, was short lived, as the VAR called down to referee Antonio Giua to inform him that the ball had hit Yildiz’s hand along the way, invalidating the score. Thuram fired just over from 25 yards, and Yildiz looked to get on the scoresheet permanently when he dribbled into position and tried to surprise Stankovic by pulling a shot to the near post, but the keeper got down to deny him. Juve had been controlling the pace of the action in the second half, which made the equalizer all the more jarring. Venezia’s first real chance of the half came when Zampano put a ball across and his fellow wing-back Ellertsson dashed in to meet it, taking advantage of an uncharacteristically timid defensive effort by Savona and bouncing a header through the outstretched hand of Di Gregorio and into the net. Vlahovic nearly put Juve back into the lead quite quickly, receiving a lofted pass from Douglas Luiz and firing from an acute angle. The shot took deflection from Idzes, forcing Stankovic to readjust as he threw his hand up to divert it over the bar. Juve were again the team that looked to be in nominal control, but with seven minutes left Venezia took the lead after Douglas Luiz gave away a rather needless free kick on the left flank. Nicolussi sent the ball into the box, and Idzes beat Gatti to it by the barest of margins, flicking it across goal and just past the hand of a flying Di Gregorio. Gonzalez was sent in along with Manuel Locatelli as a last-ditch throw of the dice to salvage the match, and Luiz very nearly did so spectacularly with a bicycle kick that flew just past the goalpost. There were less than 90 seconds of stoppage time left when Juve’s lifeline arrived when Conceição cut inside and fired for the far post. Stankovic met it with a flying save, but his parry flew into the arm of Antonio Candela as he tried to keep Luiz away from the rebound. Giua took a moment to make his decision but eventually pointed to the spot, subsequently getting mobbed by angry Venezia players. Then they spent another minute or so trying to ice Vlahovic by forcing the referee to continually move them out of the penalty area. But when things were finally ready, the striker made no mistake, using his stuttering run-up to make Stankovic twitch before calmly slotting it in the other direction to tie the score and salvage something from a game that had turned miserable. MICHELE DI GREGORIO - 5.5. He really should have done better on Ellertsson’s goal. Getting beat at the post you’re closest to is never a good look. Had less to be responsible for on the second goal. NICOLO SAVONA - 5. He’s been so good this season but he was due for a dud at some point. He was uncharacteristically timid in defending Ellertsson on Venezia’s equalizer, and wasn’t a huge factor going forward either. He’ll learn from this. FEDERICO GATTI - 6. His goal is actually a little more impressive than you realize when you see the replay and realize the ball came off his shin, which even at that range can cause some bizarre things to happen. He blocked a pair of shots and completed 94.9 percent of his passes. Just beaten to the punch on Venezia’s goal but he didn’t play it badly, Idzes just had a fraction of an inch to get to the ball. PIERRE KALULU - 6. Accurate with 96.4 percent of his passes, including five of six long balls. Tied for the team lead in clearances and also had a pair of interceptions on the defensive end. Very little got by him. DANILO - 5.5. Didn’t make any huge mistakes, but for a guy who led the team in touches (129!) and pass attempts (117!!) it didn’t feel like he was really in the game all that much. KHEPHREN THURAM - 6. Made a pair of key passes and was active defensively, tying his countryman Kalulu for the lead in clearances (5). He came this close to a worldie in the first half when it was still 1-0. WESTON McKENNIE - 5. Looked a little off in his first start since the international break. Tied for the team lead in interceptions and had a key pass as well, but his overall pass completion was 79.6. Made a couple of runs into the box from deep but wasn’t able to make anything useful out of them. TIMOTHY WEAH - 5. Very little production out of him. Didn’t complete a cross and when he did get into a few potentially damaging positions he showed a lack of control that prevented him from doing much of anything with it. TEUN KOOPMEINERS - 5.5. Koopmeiners’ season has been odd so far, as evidenced by the fact that you can watch a game thinking he’s doing nothing and then look at the stats and realize he led (or co-led, in this case) the team in key passes. Still, you would love to see him integrate into the system enough to help the ball flow through the middle. KENAN YILDIZ - 5.5. Had a goal disallowed and had more dribbles than anyone save McKennie (who equalled him), but didn’t create a whole ton of threat for his side of the field. DUSAN VLAHOVIC - 6. Stroked home the penalty confidently and was denied a goal that would’ve made it 2-1 by a great Stankovic save. Was a willing runner the entire night. FRANCISCO CONCEIÇÃO - 5.5. Couldn’t really penetrate with his dribbling, and he only completed just over three-quarters of his passes. He did, however, let loose on the shot that eventually turned into Juve’s penalty. DOUGLAS LUIZ - 5. Douglas Luiz making dumb fouls that lead to goals is a theme that even this injury layoff couldn’t change. It came outside the box this time, but it was needless and gave Verona a set piece when they really needed it. That bicycle would’ve bumped this up a bit if it had gone in. NICOLO FAGIOLI - NR. Didn’t misplace a pass, but also didn’t make much in the way of trouble for Venezia with them. NICO GONZALEZ - NR. Only touched the ball three times in his brief cameo. MANUEL LOCATELLI - NR. Came in to add some passing range but wasn’t afforded a lot of time to impact the game. Hugeux was the one who was nominally in charge Saturday night, but in this day and age it’s fair to wonder whether or not they’re just relaying instructions from the stands. I’m likely in the minority on this, but I didn’t think Juve was the better team on the field by a good margin — excepting a 20-minute period right after they took the lead. The sequences of passes have been encouraging, which is one of the things we’ve needed to see out of this attack as it turns into what it’s supposed to be under Motta. With all that said, the problems with moving a low block continue to hold this team back. They were unable to put together big chances with any semblance of frequency, often having to employ low-percentage shots and often bypassing the midfield entirely. Still, Juve carried a lot of possession in this game, and there are signs that they’re learning how to use it. The question becomes when (or if, if you’re a pessimist) that will come full circle and have the team working on all cylinders. This is where the need for patience comes in. This is the very beginning of the project for Motta. As with most projects, one of the most important elements is time. Yes, there is frustration, but the signs are pointing in the right direction. Motta just needs the time to get there. Next on the schedule is a Tuesday clash with Cagliari in Juve’s first Coppa Italia game of the season. League fixtures against Monza (away) and Fiorentina (home) will follow — the latter of which is becoming magnified in importance given how Raffaele Palladino has them playing. Gambling Problem?

According to Calciomercato, Hancko has leapfrogged Paris Saint-Germain outcast Milan Skriniar on Bianconeri’s shopping list. Hancko is familiar with Italian football. Despite only making five league appearances for Fiorentina, he spent three years under contract at Stadio Artemio Franchi before departing the country to join Sparta Prague in 2022. He has only risen to prominence at De Kuip, becoming one of Europe’s most sought-after defensive prospects. Feyenoord turned down Atletico Madrid’s advances in the summer. However, Juventus are ready to launch an assault this winter to address a lack of numbers at the back after injuries to Gleison Bremer and Juan Cabal decimated Thiago Motta’s defensive options. Hancko will not come cheap, though. On the contrary, Feyenoord will require up to €30 million to sanction the 26-year-old’s exit. While that’s a substantial figure, Juventus would save a truckload of money on his wages. Unlike Hancko, Skriniar earns a hefty €10m net per season at the Parc des Princes. That’s not to mention he’s two years older than the Slovakia international.  In addition to Hancko, Juventus are keeping close tabs on Benfica prodigy Antonio Silva. Represented by Portuguese super-agent Jorge Mendes, the 21-year-old is ready to take his career to the next step, with Juventus lurking in the shadows. But the Feyenoord ace remains a priority for the Italian powerhouse.  Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked * Comment *  Name *  Email *  Website

During his latest interview with Sky Sport via Gianluca Di Marzio, Giuntoli denied Bianconeri’s interest in the unsettled Manchester United forward. It’s no secret that Juventus are in the market for a reliable backup option for Dusan Vlahovic. Heavily linked with a summer move for Lille talisman Jonathan David, the record-time Serie A champions have cast a wide net in search of a new frontman. Zirzkee has reportedly caught their eye after struggling to adapt to life in the Premier League upon his big-money transfer from Bologna in the summer. However, Giuntoli insists Juventus will not make any approach for the Dutch youngster in the upcoming transfer window. “Zirkzee? He is a very good player, but he belongs to another team. We are waiting for Milik,” Giuntoli was adamant. “Milik is recovering; his knee isn’t giving him problems. We hope he can make a quick return.“ Arkadiusz Milik has been on the sidelines since the tail-end of last season with a long-term anterior cruciate ligament injury. In addition to missing out on EURO 2024, the Poland international has yet to feature for Juventus this term after undergoing another knee injury in September.  Hopefully, he could be at Thiago Motta’s disposal by the end of December. Meanwhile, Juventus continue to rely on Vlahovic to carry the goalscoring burden all by himself. The Serb slotted home a last-gasp penalty to spare Bianconeri’s blushes in a 2-2 home draw against Venezia last night. Your email address will not be published.

Another draw against a provincial side. In the 50th minute of Juventus’ game against Venezia on Saturday night, the Allianz Stadium was very much in a good mood. That is because Kenan Yildiz had just scored what we thought was Juve’s second goal of the night, then proceeded to do a little bit of dancing by the corner flag with Khephren Thuram. It was that at the moment, we thought, that Juve’s habit of risking dropped points against teams in the bottom half of the Serie A table was going to (finally) be put on hold for a bit. The happy vibes were short lived. Yildiz’s goal was ruled out for a hand ball after his headed effort unfortunately went right into the path of where his right hand was. And it was at that moment that everything just went straight into the pishadoo. The only thing that prevented Juventus from suffering their first defeat to Serie A opposition this season was Dusan Vlahovic’s penalty kick in the 95th minute. It was about as unrewarding of a goal celebration as many of us have probably experienced this season, with Juventus dropping more points to a team they had no business doing exactly that against. And to make things even worse, if it wasn’t for Vlahovic staying perfect from the penalty spot this season, Juventus’ first domestic loss of the season would have felt totally justified and deserved despite the fact that they were playing a Venezia side with just two wins to their name entering Saturday night’s matchup at the Allianz. It’s just another draw in a season full of them. And like the Lecce draw a couple of weeks ago, it’s a draw against one of the worst teams in the league that very much feels like a loss. Maybe because it almost nearly was exactly that.  The swing from being up 2-0 for about two minutes to having the goal wiped away and Venezia tying things up shortly after really just sums up so many things about this season. Just when we thought Juventus were on their way to recording a win over Venezia on a night when they weren’t playing anywhere close to the level when they beat Manchester City a few days earlier, the same things that have haunted Thiago Motta’s side popped up again. That’s now 10 draws in the first 16 league games this season. Let me repeat: Ten in 16! That’s a whopping 62.5% of Juve’s Serie A fixtures this season have finished in draws.  As of this writing, the top four teams in the Serie A table — Atalanta, Napoli, Inter Milan and Fiorentina — have 11 draws ... combined. So it goes. This is a team that is consistently doing one thing this season — dropping points.  At this rate, you don’t know when it will end because just when you think they will actually do it, something like what happened against Venezia and previously Lecce pops up. I can’t help but go back to the feeling after the Vlahovic penalty was scored because I just met it with such apathy. This game was headed to a loss — and a deserved one at that — against the worst team in Serie A so far this season, and even stealing a late point didn’t feel that way. It was just ... yeah, nothing to get even remotely excited about. Call it a Champions League hangover or whatever you want, but Juventus have now recorded draws against teams who are currently 20th, 16th, 15th, 13th, 10th and eighth in the Serie A table. You turn even three or four of those draws into wins, and Juve’s basically right there alongside Atalanta and Napoli atop the Serie A table. Instead, we’re left to sit here and see Juventus nearly lose against a Venezia team that had all of two points to their name away from home this season. Now it’s three — and that’s frustrating as all hell. (At least it’s not five, I guess, so there’s that if nothing else.) Gambling Problem? Call 1-800-GAMBLER (1-800-426-2537). Hope is here.

The Birmingham-based side are ready to break the bank and re expected to establish contacts with the Bianconeri soon. Sporting director Cristiano Giuntoli has recently renewed the player with a contract till 2029, thus enabling the provision to extract a sizeable future transfer fee. Currently, Juventus value the Turkish international at €80 million and the price is set to inflate with his improving performances.  Liverpool were the first club to inquire about Yildiz but no advancements were made by the Merseyside team. Right now, Aston Villa’s interest is considered to be strong but the Old Lady do not want to be tempted by the money from the Premier League.  This winter transfer window is set to be key as Villa could make an approach to test the waters for summer.    Trambak Bhattacherjee | GIFN @2024 - All Rights Reserved.

According to Radio Kiss Kiss via TMW, Partenopei sporting director Giovanni Manna has switched his sights on Inter stalwart Stefan de Vrij. Danilo has recently emerged as a concrete transfer target for Napoli after losing his indispensable first-team status under Thiago Motta. However, long-term injuries to Gleison Bremer and Juan Cabal have thrown the Brazilian veteran a lifeline at the Allianz Stadium. Strapped for reliable options at the back, Motta has reinstated Danilo, whose deal at Juventus runs out at the end of the season. Napoli had hoped to capitalize on the 33-year-old’s contract wobble before deciding to focus on other targets.  Juventus are having second thoughts about Danilo’s future at the club. After initially deciding against renewing his expiring contract, they are now open to offering him a short-term extension. Therefore, Napoli have identified De Vrij as a new top defensive target. The 32-year-old Dutchman has been outstanding since swapping Lazio for Giuseppe Meazza in 2018. However, he’ll be out of contract in the summer of 2025, with Inter seemingly reluctant to propose fresh terms. That could change if De Vrij continues to go from strength to strength. Indeed, the rumored Napoli target has excelled in Francesco Acerbi’s absence, delivering outstanding performances in numerous high-profile matches. Despite entering the autumn of his playing career, De Vrij is still one of the most dependable center-backs in Serie A. Your email address will not be published.

According to Calciomercato, the 31-year-old midfielder has two offers on the table after severing ties with the Bianconeri. Juventus terminated Pogba’s contract last month after the European Court of Arbitration for Sport reduced his ban. The ex-Manchester United playmaker barely featured for the Turin giants in his second stint at the Allianz Stadium, with the infamous doping suspension and recurring fitness problems to only 12 appearances across two seasons. Despite his underwhelming spell at Juventus, Pogba remains a household name in world football. Therefore, he should have no problems finding a new club in January. However, whether he’ll stay in Europe remains questionable. If he does, a reunion with Adrien Rabiot could be on the cards.  Rabiot, who swapped Juventus for Marseille in the summer, has reportedly called Pogba to join him at the Stade Velodrome. Manager Roberto De Zerbi is open to giving the 2018 World Cup winner the benefit of the doubt. But Pogba’s uncertain physical condition could throw a spanner in the works.  Away from action for almost two years, Pogba faces an uphill battle to regain match fitness and prove he can still perform at the highest level. Even though his rumored switch to Marseille may fail to materialize, the former Juventus superstar could continue his career on another continent.

For the first time in a few weeks, Juventus got themselves a win on Wednesday night. It wasn’t just a win in a big game — it was simply a win, something that they hadn’t recorded in over a month after posting four straight draws coming out of the November international break.

   It was a refreshing performance for a number of reasons, but the simple fact of getting a win — and a very big and important one at that — was a change for the better. But, like so many times before, we are now shifting our focus from what Juventus did against Manchester City over to the game following a big (European) win — and you can’t help but wonder what’s next. And as much as Man City are very much not in a vintage Manchester City kind of form at the current moment, it’s pretty easy to say that the team next up on Juventus’ schedule is very much not like the team they just faced in the Champions League. Rather than the four-time defending Premier League champions with one of the best managers to ever walk the sidelines of the sport, the next team to roll into Allianz Stadium on Saturday night during Juve’s four-game homestand has all of two wins to their name so far this season. Venezia, back in Serie A after a two-year absence, sit at the very bottom of the league table, giving Juventus a potentially soft landing after a very thrilling yet physically taxing win over Manchester City just three days ago. In terms of sheer talent from the opposition, it’s quite the difference to go from one of the most valuable squads in the world to what Venezia will roll out against Juventus. And it’s safe to say that Juventus will very much not be perceived as any sort of underdog like many thought they were when they lined up against Manchester City a couple of days ago. Instead, it’s basically going to be the exact opposition against a Venezia side that has recorded all of two points in their first eight games away from home this season. For the second straight season, Eusebio Di Francesco looks like he’s in for quite the relegation fight. Although, unlike last season when he was with Frosinone, there has not been a huge fall after a red-hot start to the season. Instead, Venezia lost three out of their first four games, got their first win, lost another three of their next four, won again, and have now lost four out of their last five. So, the win-once-every-five-games trend has not continued, but Venezia did at least get a point with last weekend’s 2-2 draw against fellow relegation battlers Como the last time out. This is very much the kind of form that you would expect from a relegation battler. And with two wins to their name through the first 15 games of the 2024-25 season, this is why Venezia are very much at the bottom of the Serie A table. Coming off such an emotional and well-played victory over Manchester City, the objective is simple for Juventus as they play their third straight game at the Allianz: avoid disaster. So many of Juve’s domestic draws this season have been against clubs in which they really have no business dropping points against. Look no further than what happened a couple of weeks ago against Lecce, a team that had previously scored just six goals all season. There’s the draw against Cagliari, the draw against Parma, the draw against Empoli. These are all games in which Juventus should have won, but didn’t. For all of the good things against Manchester City that Juventus went out and did, dropping points against the worst team in Serie A through the opening 15 matchdays would be a serious letdown. Juventus are starting to get healthy, starting to give their manager options to even do a little bit of squad rotation, and they’ve got a relatively soft schedule until the final fixture of 2024 when they face red-hot Fiorentina. This is the time to get some momentum going, and using the win over Manchester City as the jumping off point seems like a very good thing to try and accomplish. Saturday may be the 22nd birthday of Juventus’ new favorite Portuguese short king, it is the player who has taken up shop on the other wing most of the time with whom we will chat about. That’s because when you’re facing the team that’s sitting dead last in the table and has the third-worst defense Serie A has to offer, it probably has your attackers thinking good thoughts. And we all know how much a certain young Turkiye attacker likes to crush the soul of opposing defenders whenever it is humanly possible. It was almost a year ago that Di Francesco, then the manager of a Frosinone side that was tumbling down the Serie A table, saw Kenan Yildiz score his first senior level goal by doing what he does best — using his incredible foot skills to split a pair of defenders in quick fashion and find the back of the net. It was, basically, Yildiz’s skillset in a nutshell, and it proved a glimpse of what he’s capable of even when it’s operating in relatively tight spaces. But here’s the thing with Yildiz’s performances of late: Since his stunning brace as a second-half substitute against Inter Milan on Oct. 27 at the San Siro, he has one goal and one assist in nine appearances in all competitions. That’s as many goals as he recorded with Turkiye during the last international break. So while we all love the skills and the tricks and the bamboozling of opposing defenders, it’s not like Yildiz is lighting things up the last six weeks when it comes to goals and assists. The hope, of course, is that facing a team that has a goal differential of minus-14 through their first 15 games of the season will be a sort of get-right game for Yildiz and the rest of the Juventus attack. And like the team as a whole, the hope is also that Yildiz can build off the good things he did against Manchester City midweek and keep the good times going when facing the worst team in the league as we head toward the middle of December.  We know that Di Francesco won’t want to see Yildiz do a repeat of what he did against the last team he managed a year ago. But that certainly would be a positive development — and for a whole host of reasons considering how Juve’s struggled to consistently score goals this season. When: Saturday, Dec. 14, 2024.

Despite the glaring contrasts between the club’s two most recent opponents — last year’s Premier League winners and Serie A’s 20th-place team — Juve managerThiago Motta insisted that it’s business as usual and emphasized that Saturday night’s opponents, despite their losing record, are worthy of respect and arduous preparation. Indeed, amid the excitement born from their win against Manchester City, Motta asserted that the game ahead is always the most important, especially considering Juventus’ unfortunate tendency this year to drop points against smaller sides.  “Wednesday’s match against Manchester City was a good game, resulting in a victory that we deserved and that we were looking for in the Champions League,” Motta said. “But that challenge is part of the past, now our attention turns to Venezia who are a tough and combative team. The team is doing well in all respects, both physically and in terms of mood. We are focused on the next game, our approach to matches is always the same, we have the same respect for all opponents. We want to go into the game and do our best, reading the game well and taking our chances efficiently.” What is more, Motta asserted that “Venezia are a team that always tries to play good football. They have caused problems for many opponents with their play but have not gotten the results. They play good football and have a very experienced coach. We have to be very careful as always and put our game plan into practice. The players know what we need from them tomorrow. We have to start the match with the highest level of intensity to get a result.” Regarding the squad, Motta was asked about some of the heroes from Wednesday’s game against Manchester City, including Teun Koopmeiners and the two goal scorers, Weston McKennie and Dusan Vlahovic. According to Motta, “Koopmeiners is a key player for us. I like to watch his body language, which is fantastic, his mental approach to games is excellent. He’s a great player and it’s hard to take someone like him off the field for so many reasons. McKennie can play from the start: I am lucky to have players with different characteristics who give me different alternatives. Weston, with the qualities he has, needs to get into the box to score more, he has the technical and physical ability to break into space in the final third and finish chances. Dusan did very well on Wednesday, especially in the second half. I’m happy for him, for his performance and the goal. Tomorrow as a team we have another opportunity to put in another great performance.” Finally, Motta also provided an update on the squad’s extensive injury list. “Tomorrow there will be no (Jonas) Rouhi in addition to (Gleison) Bremer, (Juan) Cabal, (Arkadiusz) Milik and (Andrea) Cambiaso who are not yet fit to play,” Motta said. However, Nico Gonzalez, who lit up the wing at the start of the season but has been out injured since the Oct. 2 win over RB Leipzig, is “back in the squad, and we are all happy about that, he has been working hard with our staff to be available again,” Motta added.

Juventus and Inter do not want to miss out on a strong and proven centre-back as they aim to send him proposals this winter but it appears that Barcelona have emerged as the frontrunners in the race to land Tah. The Blaugranas’ sporting director Deco has contacted the 28-year-old’s entourage but is yet to accept their conditions.  As for the Italian sides, neither Juventus nor Inter can match the Tah’s demands but negotiations are set to take place even though Barcelona have the edge.    Trambak Bhattacherjee | GIFN @2024 - All Rights Reserved.

The chaos continued as both sides had goals ruled out for offside by the VAR before Monaco centre-back Wilfried Singo was dismissed just before the hour mark for two yellow cards. Soungoutou Magassa picked the perfect time to score his first goal for the club, charging on to Christian Mawissa's angled pass and drilling it low into the corner to restore Monaco's lead in the 67th minute.

The rest, as they say, is history: Grimaldo scored 27 goals and 66 assists in 303 appearances – 32 of those goal contributions coming in his final season – and won four league titles before leaving in 2023 as arguably the greatest left back in Benfica history. Grimaldo joined Bayer Leverkusen on a free transfer, a move that would have major repercussions for all parties involved: Whilst Grimaldo spurred Leverkusen to an undefeated domestic double, Benfica’s inability to find an adequate replacement doomed their attempts to retain the championship, finishing 10 points behind Sporting and failing to claim any major silverware. With neither of their summer arrivals – David Jurásek and Juan Bernat – convincing at left back, Benfica had no other choice but to head to the transfer market in January.   Exactly eight years and 19 days after Grimaldo’s arrival, Benfica attempted to repeat that formula by signing a 20-year-old, Spanish left back whose pathway to first-team football was blocked, and who had no other choice but to leave one of the biggest clubs in Europe in order to play senior football. Álvaro Carreras (also more widely known as Álvaro Fernández in the UK)  joined on loan from Manchester United with a €6 million option to buy, whilst United retained a €20m buyback clause. With Luke Shaw and Tyrell Malacia both spending more time on the treatment table than the pitch, and with Carreras taking his game to new heights this season, it may only be a matter of time before United bring Carreras back to Old Trafford as they look to solve a problem position in defence. After bouncing around from Racing de Ferrol to Deportivo de la Coruña to Real Madrid, Carreras left Spain in 2020 and joined Manchester United, where he emerged as a regular for the U23s and was named their Player of the Season, but never quite managed to make his first-team debut. He was loaned out to EFL Championship side Preston North End for the 2022/23 campaign and quickly impressed with 6 assists in 42 appearances before heading to newly promoted LaLiga side Granada for the 2023/24 season, only to be recalled in January and join Benfica. Carreras was gradually eased into the team, remaining on the bench in six of his first 11 league matches before playing 87+ minutes in five of his next six to end the campaign, enough to convince Benfica to trigger their option and sign him on a contract through 2029. Having spent the past two seasons on loan, Carreras finally has the chance to settle down and develop in the same place over a long-term period, and it’s clear to see that this stability is paying dividends. After coming on for the final half-hour of their opening day defeat at Famalicão, he replaced the injured Jan-Niklas Beste in the 20th minute vs. Casa Pia and seized the opportunity, completing 4/5 long balls, registering 3 key passes, and winning 6/10 duels. Since then, Carreras has started in each of Benfica’s last 14 matches, making him the sole outfield player to play every single minute since the appointment of Bruno Lage on September 5. Only three Benfica players have created more chances than Carreras (13), who boasts the joint-second-highest FotMob rating (7.73) in their squad after Kerem Aktürkoğlu (8.19).   “Carreras looks like a completely new player this season,” said @CurtaVermelha, one of the biggest Benfica accounts on Twitter. “Whilst Benfica use a 4-3-3 base, they attack in a 3-4-2-1 and switch between a 5-3-2 or a 4-4-2 in defence. Carreras is that piece that offers all these dynamics because he is a fast, physically imposing defender who covers space well, who’s hard to beat in duels, and who is looking far more comfortable on the ball and capable of penetrating through the middle with vertical passes.” “Last season, he pretty much lost the ball 50% of the times that he touched it, losing possession 12 times in a 45-minute cameo vs. Toulouse in February. This season, not only is he defending well, but he can build from the back and pop up in the box and the flanks. He can’t change a game by himself with his attacking quality like Grimaldo, but he’s a much more solid defender. Similarly to Riccardo Calafiori, he’s a hybrid of a centre back and a left back, a player who allows the team to be much more solid defensively and for players like Ángel Di María to be more focused on going forward.”   At 21 years old, Carreras is in the form of his life at Benfica, and the proof is in the pudding. With the exception of their 1-0 defeat at Bayern, he’s racked up one goal contribution in each of Benfica’s last four matches, ending October with an assist vs. Rio Ave and Santa Clara before equalizing in a 2-1 win vs. Farense, beating Ricardo Velho at his near post with a well-drilled effort. He was back at it again in their next league fixture, feigning to go wide before cutting inside and carving a way past yet another Portuguese international goalkeeper – Diogo Costa – with a sensational weak-footed finish. Porto equalised before halftime, but Benfica would storm back to a 4-1 victory, the first time since 1964 that they scored 4+ goals vs. Porto in a league fixture.   Benfica sit third in the table, two points behind Porto and eight behind Sporting, with a game in hand on both. They have won each of their last eight matches vs. Portuguese opponents, and they’ll be counting on Carreras – a player who has scored more goals in his last three matches (two) than in the first 85 matches (one) of his senior club career – as they look to build on their momentum and close the distance on their rivals.

Musiala’s chance was set up when Harry Kane headed Leroy Sane’s cross back across the face of goal.

However, they have fared better in the Bundesliga, sitting three points clear at the top of the table after nine games.  ""What we know is you have to win around six (of eight) games to reach the top eight,"" Kompany said.  ""You have to win three games and that should be enough for the playoffs. My goal is to reach the top eight."" Bayern last failed to reach the Champions League knockout stages in 2002-03, finishing bottom of a group that featured Deportivo La Coruna, Lens and Milan.  But despite their stuttering start in the competition so far, Kompany said the new format plays no role in the team's planning.  ""I don't want to think too far ahead because we have enough games,"" Kompany said. ""We have to win against Benfica. I don't want to spend too much time thinking about what could happen in January. ""No one knows how it will work. We only know we want to win tomorrow. We play at home. That is my only goal."" Bayern, however, have every confidence of getting their European campaign back on track, with the German outfit boasting an impressive record against Benfica.  They have played 12 major European matches against Benfica and have never lost (W9 D3).  But Bruno Lage's side will be looking to buck that trend, having beaten Atletico Madrid and Red Star Belgrade so far, but they did lose to Feyenoord last time out.  ""We have a lot of confidence going into this game. We will always adapt and take the steps that are right for the team,"" Kompany said.  ""But to say we will change everything is not serious. We just want to win again at home.  © Copyright 2024 FotMob","Bayern Munich face Benfica in the Champions League on Wednesday, a game Vincent Kompany said his side must win to achieve their ambitions."

Sanches suffered a hamstring injury in training last month and missed Benfica's last six matches, including their wins over Red Star Belgrade and Atletico Madrid in their opening two Champions League matches. ""Let's be very clear about this, because we have nothing to hide. Renato has been doing a lot of work. We had predicted that he could return a little earlier, then a little later, but I can confirm that Renato will be involved for the game against Feyenoord,"" Lage said. Sanches, who was a teenage prodigy at Benfica, has struggled for consistency since his record transfer to Bayern Munich aged 18 in 2016. He has since played for Swansea City, Lille, Paris Saint-Germain and Roma before the French giants loaned him back to Benfica this campaign. Lage said only defensive midfielder Leandro Barreiro would be missing from the Benfica lineup for the match due to a thigh injury. Benfica are on a run of six successive victories, with their 4-0 home win over Atletico earlier this month one of the surprise results of the early stages of the new-look Champions League competition. ""It is important to highlight that the work we did ahead of the Atletico match happens for every game,"" Lage said. ""First, we understand what we did well in our previous game, and we study the opponent in detail. We define the strategy, practise it and look to instil confidence in the players. That's what we do for every game, be it in the championship, in the Champions League or in the cup. ""We are confident, we've prepared very well and our confidence comes from the fact that when we transmit our ideas to the players, they feel confident that they can play a good game,"" added Lage, who returned to coach Benfica last month after Roger Schmidt was fired. Lage was Wolves manager in the Premier League in the 2021-22 season and briefly into the next campaign, before losing his job after a run of poor results. ""My time in the Premier League gave me experience that I didn't have before, but that's part of any coach's experience,"" he told reporters. ""The more experience we have, the more we will learn.

Gabriel Magalhães, Benjamin White and Riccardo Calafiori are all expected to miss the game for Arsenal, while rotation option Takehiro Tomiyasu remains sidelined and Oleksandr Zinchenko also missed the weekend’s match against Fulham. Mikel Arteta found a creative solution for that fixture as Jurriën Timber was shifted across to the left of the back line and Thomas Partey dropped to the right, so it will be interesting to see whether a more conventional option like Kieran Tierney is preferred for this relatively lower-stakes game. Arsenal drew that game at Fulham, taking their current unbeaten run to six games, in all competitions.    Monaco, on the other hand, have to deal with a couple of suspensions. Versatile defender Wilfried Singo’s red card led to their dramatic defeat against Benfica in the last round, while young Christian Mawissa received his third yellow card of the Champions League season in that game. Krépin Diatta, who has mostly been used as a right back this season, is also out injured. Despite these absences, both defences can be expected to hold firm as they have conceded the second-lowest xG tally in their respective leagues. In a potentially tight match, Arsenal may well turn to set-pieces again having scored from corners in each of their last four games. However, they might meet their match in this respect too as Monaco have conceded the fewest shots from set-pieces in Ligue 1 this season.  23-year-old USMNT striker Folarin Balogun will miss the opportunity to reunite with former club Arsenal as he too is out injured, but Monaco have a whole host of other youngsters who will be keen to impress. Chief among them will be teenage Moroccan international Eliesse Ben Seghir, who is equally capable of scoring and creating goals as his tally of four goals and three assists in Ligue 1 this season shows. Rotating between the left and central attacking positions in Monaco’s 4-2-3-1 formation, he is sure to excite whenever he gets on the ball.   Ben Seghir can rather steal the spotlight away from some of his teammates at times, especially fellow attacker Maghnes Akliouche. The French youth international has four goals and as many assists to his name for Monaco on the back of a busy summer in which he was a part of France’s silver medal-winning Olympic side. Senegalese midfielder Lamine Camara and Brazilian right back Vanderson should also be considered ones to watch, while 18-year-old striker George Ilenikhena will look to make an impact off the bench again.  Monaco have adopted a pretty intense style of play under Adi Hütter this season, but it might just prove to be their undoing against an Arsenal side who have grit and star power in equal measure.

Similarities don’t end there. Much like Erik ten Hag, Rúben Amorim took the helm at Sporting during a period of crisis. Fans were so unhappy; they broke into the training ground and physically assaulted the players back in 2018.   A first league title in 18 years back in 2020/21 and a second in 2023/24 helped smooth things over, but all of that is in the distance past now, and the Lisbon side will have to prepare for life without their talismanic manager. Amorim couldn’t have wished for a better send-off. A 4-1 home win over soon-to-be rival Pep Guardiola to plunge Man City into crisis somewhat overshadowed the fireworks and tears before the game. And that was followed by a 4-2 comeback win at Braga, where Sporting scored three goals in the last 10 minutes of the game.   Former Sporting B manager João Pereira is the man who has been given the unenviable task of filling Amorim’s beautifully tailored boots and he has a lot of work to do if he wants to build upon what he’s inherited. Since Ten Hag left, Ajax are yet to win another shield, a fate that Sporting and their new manager, Pereira, will hope to avoid now that Amorim is gone. Thankfully they have an ace in the hole, arguably the best striker in the world. With 23 goals in his first 18 games across all competitions, no striker on the planet is playing like Viktor Gyökeres, not even the big Norwegian over in Manchester can compete. His hattrick against Man City in the Champions League was his crowning moment. Yes, two of them were penalties, but his first goal showed the world exactly what he’s capable of, breaking away before slowly dinking it past Ederson.   On the pitch, the transition should be seamless for Sporting. There isn’t much of a difference between Pereira and his old boss in terms of tactics, Pereira also likes to play with three central defenders and bombing wingbacks. Like under Amorim, there will be a high defensive line and not an excessive amount of pressing, but enough to keep the opposition on their toes. His greatest challenge will come off the pitch, however. Sporting’s players loved Amorim. During the summer transfer window, Gyökeres’ agent came out and said he would have left the club if the manager hadn’t remained. Gyökeres and midfielder Morten Hjulmand were reportedly furious when they found out Amorim would be leaving. Results haven’t changed since the announcement, but if one result doesn’t go there way, all that positive feeling built up could fly out the window. Pereira isn’t off to the best of starts. He’s yet to manage a game and he’s already in trouble with Portugal’s National Association of managers, with President Jose Pereira (no relation) saying, “We cannot recognise him as Sporting’s coach as he does not have the certification required to carry out his duties.” If you’re a fan of omens, Amorim had a similar issue when he took over at Casa Pia. Although the club were deducted six points and he was suspended from all footballing activity for a year, he turned out pretty well for Sporting. Their first game of the post-Amorim era will come against Amarante FC in the Taça de Portugal, a little warm up for the real test just four days later, a Champions League tie with Mikel Arteta’s Arsenal at the Estádio José Alvalade. The Leões remain the only side in Europe’s top six leagues with a 100% record, comfortably sitting 11 points above second placed Porto at the top of the table and well on course to lift a second consecutive title for the first time since 1954.   The club’s incredible start to the season, as well as strong showings in the previous few, mean the vultures will soon come sniffing, and players like Gyökeres will likely leave for pastures new. Man United have inevitably been linked but Amorim has promised not to sign any Sporting players in the January transfer window, and it may already be too late when the summer rolls around. Gyökeres and Amorim aren’t the first to leave Sporting for bigger and (maybe) better things, and they certainly won’t be the last. Throughout its history, the club has nothing if not resourceful. The next generation will take over. Players like 17-year-old Geovany Quenda, the latest to emerge from their famed academy, already have the world at their feet. In theory, Sporting are in safe hands as they wrestle with the transition that so many club’s before them have struggled with.

Gyokeres, by comparison, has 16 goals and one assist in the Primeira Liga while, despite a dip in form, Erling Haaland has 12 goals in the Premier League this term.

""But we are not going to get hung up on finding any striker now because we are going to focus first on what Robert can do. I surely think he is happy to be here.

The Swede caught global attention in Sporting CP’s recent Champions League clash with Manchester City, producing a hat-trick to help his team to a shock 4-1 win. He accumulated an expected goals (xG) total of 2.41 in the match, accounting for most of Sporting's overall 2.87xG. ""Gyokeres is a good player. He has been scoring goals for some time in Portugal.

The 39-year-old enjoyed a wildly successful four-year spell in charge of Sporting CP, which began in March 2020, two months after the Lisbon giants sold Fernandes to United. Amorim delivered two Primeira Liga and two Taca da Liga trophies during his time at the Estadio Jose Alvalade, recording a 71% win rate through 231 matches at the helm (164 wins, 34 draws, 33 losses). In the Primeira Liga, they won 77% of their games under him (120/156), the best win ratio of any team across Europe's top 10 leagues since he took charge. Amorim's first game in charge of United will be a Premier League trip to Ipswich Town on November 24, and Fernandes has faith that he can change their fortunes. ""I hope he does the same here because you know sometimes a person can change the energy of a space, if it's the right moment,"" Fernandes told United's media channels. ""We hope this is the right moment for him to come and bring his energy, bring his qualities and his knowledge of football, because he's done something really, really special at Sporting.  ""If someone doubts that, it's about just looking at the past.

""I've seen many, many moments where players were struggling and he kept his faith in them.

Appointed on November 1 in the wake of Erik ten Hag's dismissal, Amorim had to serve out his final couple of games at Sporting CP. And what a final week in charge it was. Amorim's glittering spell with Sporting ended with a 4-2 victory at Braga on Sunday, their 11th win in as many Primeira Liga matches this campaign. That win over his former club came after a magnificent 4-1 defeat of Manchester City in the Champions League, which left Sporting sitting second in the standings with 10 points from four matches, behind only Liverpool. United, meanwhile, are certainly in a better place than they were when Ten Hag was sacked in late October, with interim boss Ruud van Nistelrooy guiding them through four games without a defeat, and capping off his temporary spell in charge with a 3-0 win over Leicester City. The Red Devils are, however, in 13th place in the Premier League, and Opta's supercomputer hands them only a 13.2% chance of securing a top-six finish, so there is certainly work to do for Amorim.  That being said, United are only four points behind Chelsea, Arsenal, Nottingham Forest and Brighton, who occupy third to sixth, and there is plenty of time left to turn the ship around. So, what does the data say about Amorim's time at Sporting, and what are the main issues he needs to fix at United? A club legend Amorim will go down as one of the greats in Sporting's history, even if some fans have been left frustrated by his mid-season exit. He leaves Sporting having taken charge of 231 games in all competitions, the most in the club's history (on record).  Amorim won 164 of those matches, losing just 33 times, with his 71% win percentage also a club record-high mark. His team scored 510 goals, averaging 2.2 per game. During Amorim's time in charge, only Man City (127) won more matches than his Sporting team (122) across Europe's top 10 leagues. That 77.2% win percentage is the best of any side in Europe's top 10 divisions. Get United's attack back on track United overperformed their expected goals in Sunday's win over Leicester, netting three times from chances worthy of only 0.76 xG. Yet that has been in stark contrast to the general trend for United this term. United have the seventh-highest xG in the league (17.52), yet they have only scored 12 goals, the fourth-lowest total in the competition. That 5.52 xG underperformance is the second-biggest negative differential between xG and goals scored in the division, with only Crystal Palace (-5.59) having a worse underperformance. The Red Devils' big chance conversion rate of 18.75% (6/32) is also the worst in the Premier League, and no team has squandered as many such opportunities (26). Amorim's first task, then, will be to get the team not only clicking going forward but converting more of the chances they do create. The omens are good based on Sporting's season so far. They have netted 39 times in 11 Primeira Liga matches in 2024-25, outperforming their league-high 30.36 xG. That 8.64 overperformance is the highest in Portugal's top flight. Only Braga (55.17%) boast a greater big-chance conversion rate than Sporting (50.94% - 27/53), who have had 257 shots, an average of 23 per match. Of course, Sporting do have Europe's in-form forward, Viktor Gyokeres, leading the charge. He has netted 16 Primeira Liga goals this term, which is the highest total of any player across Europe's top five leagues, while of players to net at least five times, the Swede has the best minutes per goal ratio (61).  In contrast, United trio Marcus Rashford, Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee have just two league goals between them this season. While he may be missing the elite-level sharpshooter that would help turn the tide quickly at United, Amorim will at least have one of Europe's best playmakers to call on. Just how Bruno Fernandes slots into Amorim's preferred 3-4-3 system remains to be seen, but ensuring the Portugal international is able to supply a consistent chain of chances is crucial. Fernandes has not had much luck in front of goal so far in 2024-25. He has had 34 shots in the league but scored only twice. Only Eberechi Eze (37) has had more shots but scored fewer goals in the top-flight this season. But creatively, you know what you are getting from Fernandes, whose tally of 45 chances created ranks behind only Barcelona's Raphinha (55) among players in Europe's big five leagues in all competitions this term, with Mohamed Salah (10) the only Premier League player to have provided more assists than Fernandes' seven. If Amorim can ensure Fernandes has the space to pick the passes, then it will be a case of fine-tuning his forwards or, perhaps, splashing the cash in January - Gyokeres has already been heavily linked. No more leaks The roof hasn't been the only thing leaking as of late at Old Trafford. Since the start of the 2022-23 season, United have recorded an expected goals against (xGA) of 137.8, which ranks as the sixth-highest total in the Premier League. United have at least overperformed, conceding 113 times, but under Ten Hag, they allowed opposing teams to have far too many chances.   In contrast, Amorim's Sporting had the lowest xGA of any ever-present Primeira Liga side during his four-and-a-half-year stint at the helm (119.7 xGA across 158 league matches). While United's per-game xGA since the start of 2022-23 stands at 1.58, Sporting's under Amorim was just 0.75. Amorim has hinted he will stick with the back three system that has served him so well during his time in Lisbon, and while getting United's attack to click into gear should be his first port of call, ensuring there is more defensive organisation is crucial. Setting the stall out A key to success for Amorim will be transferring his approach across to United. Off the ball, Sporting have looked to press high this season, with their 9.4 passes allowed per defensive action (a metric that measures the intensity of a team's press, where the lower the number, the more intense the pressing) the second-lowest in the Primeira Liga this season.  That is in contrast to United's 11.9 for 2024-25, which ranks joint 10th in the Premier League. United have forced more high turnovers (nine per game as opposed to Sporting's 8.3), though Sporting have been better at translating those situations into shots (1.6 per match, compared to United's 1.8). In possession, Sporting have had 204 sequences involving at least 10 passes this season. United, on the other hand, have had just 136, so getting the Red Devils to show more composure and patience on the ball will be a key factor for Amorim as he looks to right the wrongs of Ten Hag's tenure.

Viktor Gyokeres' hat-trick inspired the Primeira Liga leaders to a commanding victory at Estadio Jose Alvalade, where Ruben Amorim was overseeing his final home game before taking over the reins at Manchester United on November 11. Injury-hit City, who were without the likes of Rodri, Jack Grealish, Ruben Dias and John Stones, have now suffered three successive defeats in a season for the first time since April 2018. Having been knocked out of the EFL Cup by Tottenham, the Citizens also saw their 32-match unbeaten run in the Premier League ended by a 2-1 loss at Bournemouth on Saturday. And Silva knows he and his team-mates must address the slump quickly. ""At the beginning of the second half, we just gave them too many opportunities to be there and to score goals,"" the City winger said. ""[It's] disappointing because we're a bit in a dark place right now, and everything looks to be going the wrong way - even when we play well. ""Definitely, we need to look inside, check what we're not doing well and start being better very quickly. Otherwise, it will be difficult to come back from these losses. ""It's football, it's difficult to find reasons for what's happening right now to us. ""Obviously, we need to do better. Our injured players need to come back because we need them.

I am not giving up."" Bernardo Silva acknowledged Manchester City are ""in a dark place right now"" following their disappointing 4-1 defeat at Sporting CP. Viktor Gyokeres' hat-trick inspired the Primeira Liga leaders to a commanding victory at Estadio Jose Alvalade, where Ruben Amorim was overseeing his final home game before taking over the reins at Manchester United on November 11. Injury-hit City, who were without the likes of Rodri, Jack Grealish, Ruben Dias and John Stones, have now suffered three successive defeats in a season for the first time since April 2018. Having been knocked out of the EFL Cup by Tottenham, the Citizens also saw their 32-match unbeaten run in the Premier League ended by a 2-1 loss at Bournemouth on Saturday. And Silva knows he and his team-mates must address the slump quickly. ""At the beginning of the second half, we just gave them too many opportunities to be there and to score goals,"" the City winger said. ""[It's] disappointing because we're a bit in a dark place right now, and everything looks to be going the wrong way - even when we play well. ""Definitely, we need to look inside, check what we're not doing well and start being better very quickly. Otherwise, it will be difficult to come back from these losses. ""It's football, it's difficult to find reasons for what's happening right now to us. ""Obviously, we need to do better. Our injured players need to come back because we need them.

Indeed, Rúben Amorim’s team have won two of their three Champions League matches this season and will face a City team that has looked shaky in recent matches, particularly Saturday’s defeat to Bournemouth. Even as Manchester City have won games recently, opponents have been able to cause them problems in attacking transition – see Brentford, Fulham and Wolves. Against a Sporting team that has scored an incredible 35 goals in just 10 league games this season, Pep Guardiola and his players could be set for an uncomfortable evening.   This game will see two of Europe’s most potent centre forwards face each other – Viktor Gyökeres and Erling Haaland. The former has 20 goals in 14 games this season while the latter has 14 goals in 13 games. At a time when goalscoring strikers are increasingly difficult to find, Sporting and City have two Scandinavians that find the back of the net for fun. It could be argued that Gyökeres is a more rounded centre forward than Haaland. The Swede is comfortable taking the ball into his feet and linking up play. However, Gyökeres is more dangerous when attacking open space – as he did for his sensational solo goal against Estrela da Amadora last week – and there could be plenty of that behind City’s backline. By Haaland’s ridiculously high standards, a run of three goals in his last five games represents something of a lean streak. It’s also somewhat unusual that Manchester City have failed to score more than once in each of their last three games in all competitions – against Southampton, Tottenham Hotspur and Bournemouth.   Nonetheless, City have several attackers capable of producing something out of nothing with Jérémy Doku, Phil Foden, Matheus Nunes and Savinho all in contention to start on Tuesday evening. Similar could be said of Sporting CP who have Pote and Trincão to provide attacking threat in the half spaces around Gyökeres. This could be a match ultimately decided by which team can hold things together best in defensive transition. Amorim will hope that his back three formation allows Sporting to outnumber City in the attack while giving Morten Hjulmand and Hidemasa Morita the chance to control possession in midfield.  Manchester City are still figuring out a way to cope in Rodri’s absence with the Ballon d’Or set to miss the rest of the season through injury. Kevin de Bruyne, Jack Grealish, Rúben Dias, John Stones and Oscar Bobb are also currently sidelined for the Premier League champions. Meanwhile, defender Eduardo Quaresma is the only player Sporting CP have unavailable through injury, giving Amorim a full squad to choose from. Geny Catamo missed Friday’s match against Estrela da Amadora, but is expected to return at right wing back for Tuesday’s game.

Depleted by a number of injuries to key players, the Premier League champions saw a 32-game unbeaten league run ended by a loss at Bournemouth on Saturday after a midweek reverse at Tottenham in the EFL Cup fourth round, marking the first time City have lost successive matches in all competitions since September 2023. While Guardiola says he is aware of the expectations surrounding his team, he knew they were likely to suffer more defeats due to injuries and the increasing level of their opponents.  ""I know our standards, but we've lost just one game. Maybe we are going to lose again in the Premier League against Brighton and against Tottenham and against Liverpool,"" Guardiola told reporters, referring to their next three Premier League games. ""We are just two points behind Liverpool, who are a top-class team. We've started well in the Champions League, but I know people expect us to win 38 league games and win the treble every season as these are our standards.

""Sometimes, to win the treble, everything has to be on the same page with injuries, but this is not possible this time. The teams are very strong and everything is more difficult, and we have to accept that. That is the challenge."" City will be without Ballon d'Or winner Rodrigo and Oscar Bobb for most of the campaign, while John Stones, Jack Grealish and Ruben Dias remain sidelined and have not travelled to Portugal. Manuel Akanji, Nathan Ake and Kyle Walker still have problems despite being in the squad, Guardiola said, and Kevin De Bruyne and Savinho are improving, while Erling Haaland is fit. City sit third in the Champions League standings after two wins and a draw and are looking for a third consecutive European win at Portuguese champions Sporting CP, who are eighth but also have seven points and are unbeaten across all competitions this season. Guardiola's side claimed a resounding 5-0 win at Sporting when they met in the 2022 Champions League last 16, and are looking to extend their record run of unbeaten games to 27 in the competition. ""They play quite similar like we faced two seasons ago, the pattern is so clear,"" Guardiola added.

          Comment and Analysis
              @nicholaspwright
 Wednesday 27 November 2024 11:24, UK Three goals up, having limited Feyenoord to a handful of potshots, Manchester City could hardly have been more comfortable as Tuesday's game entered the final quarter of an hour. After the run of five consecutive defeats which had thrown their season into turmoil, it seemed Pep Guardiola's side were taking an invaluable step to getting back on track, just in time for their Premier League showdown with leaders Liverpool on Super Sunday. The Manchester City manager's confidence was such that he had just made a triple change, withdrawing Nathan Ake, Ilkay Gundogan and Phil Foden for some hard-earned rest and giving minutes to Kevin De Bruyne, James McAtee and Jahmai Simpson-Pusey. An uneventful conclusion beckoned. Or at least that's how it felt. Instead, a bewildering 15-minute collapse, the latest by any side with a three-goal lead in the history of the Champions League, a competition City won only last year, means they will head to Anfield on the back of their most painful result yet. And that is saying something coming three days after the heaviest home loss of Guardiola's career against Tottenham.

             It all changed in an instant. And as against Spurs on Saturday, it started with a Josko Gvardiol error. Simpson-Pusey's header, after Manuel Akanji had half cleared an attempted long pass, was awkward for the Croatia international, who had Feyenoord forwards applying pressure either side of him, but he still should have been able to deal with it. Instead, his horribly-misjudged pass-back looped agonisingly into the path of Anis Hadj-Moussa, who got there well before the stranded Ederson, to touch the ball around the goalkeeper and slide home a smart finish from an acute angle. It was the latest in a series of costly defensive errors from Gvardiol, who was at fault for Spurs' second goal as well as their opener. Soon, what looked at first like a consolation goal for the visitors came to mark the start of an epic collapse. Seven minutes later, the deficit was cut to one goal and the alarm bells were ringing loudly. City had eight defenders either in or just outside their penalty area when Igor Paixao received Hwang In-Beom's pass near the right-hand corner of the box and yet both players found ample space. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  McAtee was too late in getting the right side of the latter, while Bernardo Silva's attempt to stop the former's cross was half-hearted, giving him the freedom he needed to lift a diagonal delivery towards the far post, where City were disorganised. Gvardiol had been late to spot Quinten Timber over his shoulder, while, on the outside, Matheus Nunes failed to track Jordan Lotomba altogether, allowing the right-back, who had come on as a substitute only 10 minutes earlier, to volley the ball towards goal from near the byline. At his near post, Ederson seemed to be caught off-guard, sticking out a leg and sending the ball crashing off the upright and across goal, where a sleeping Akanji had left the unmarked Santiago Gimenez with the easy task of chesting the ball over the line. City looked shell-shocked at this point. Feyenoord, meanwhile, clearly sensed their opportunity. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Their third goal was probably the worst of the lot from a defensive perspective, coming as it did from a Hadj-Moussa ball over the top from an innocuous position, 10 yards inside his own half near the right-hand touchline. In the penultimate minute of normal time, needing to simply play it safe and see out the closing stages, City were instead pushed up towards the halfway line. Their ragged defensive line was gleefully exploited. Hadj-Moussa could have aimed his pass towards any one of four Feyenoord runners, but Paixao was the one he opted for. Ederson came steaming out of his box in an attempt to clear the danger but got nowhere near it. The winger, like Hadj-Moussa before him, had numerous targets to aim for with his subsequent cross. Hwang, Gimenez and Timber were all racing into the box untracked, with City players far too slow to get back. In the end, Paixao picked the onrushing left-back David Hancko, who had sprinted freely into the box from the opposite flank to meet his team-mate's cross with an easy headed finish, sparking jubilant Feyenoord celebrations and ensuring their stunned hosts hit a new low. Guardiola was at a loss to explain the collapse afterwards. ""The game was good for the confidence, we were playing at a good level, and then when the first thing happens, we have problems,"" he said. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  He bemoaned a lack of focus. ""It's not about not running or no commitment, but in football you have to be [switched on] in certain moments to do it."" City, once again, where found wanting in those moments and the errors continue to stack up. According to Opta, they have already made more mistakes leading to goals than in the whole of last season. They are more than halfway to matching last season's total for errors leading to shots. They remain glaringly vulnerable to quick, direct attacks but Feyenoord's three goals all came in different circumstances, underlining the scale of City's problems right now. Fail to stamp out the issues at Anfield on Sunday and this extraordinary run is likely to continue. This was a draw that felt like a loss and leaves their season at risk of imploding.

Though City ended the longest losing streak of Guardiola's managerial career on Tuesday, they are now six without a win after squandering a three-goal lead at the Etihad Stadium. It was the first time a team coached by Guardiola had failed to win a game when leading by three goals in his career, in what was his 942nd match in the dugout. City are also the first team in Champions League history to be leading by three goals as late as the 75th minute and fail to win. The result comes on the back of a humiliating 4-0 Premier League defeat to Tottenham on Saturday, and Guardiola said his players were well aware of their shortcomings. ""It was not necessary to say anything to the players, they know it perfectly,"" Guardiola said.  ""It is what it is, difficult to swallow now. We give away especially the first one and after we are not stable enough."" A brace from Erling Haaland and a goal from Ilkay Gundogan had City cruising before Anis Hadj Moussa pulled one back for Feyenoord in the 75th minute when he pounced on a terrible back pass from Josko Gvardiol. Another sloppy pass by the 22-year-old led to Santiago Gimenez making it 3-2 seven minutes later, before David Hancko equalised for the Dutch side in the 89th minute. ""He is so young, he'll learn,"" Guardiola said of Gvardiol, who looked distraught after Feyenoord's second goal.  ""I'll be so wrong if I point specific things at him. He's a fantastic player, a fantastic boy and more than ever must be helped."" At the end of the game the crowd booed City, who dropped to 15th in the 36-team standings on eight points, two points adrift of the top eight, who qualify automatically for the last 16. ""They come here not to remember the success in the past, but to see the team win,"" Guardiola said of City's supporters. ""Of course they are completely right to express what they feel. Of course (they are) disappointed."" Guardiola's side next face one of their toughest tests of the season when they visit Premier League leaders Liverpool on Sunday. A loss would leave City 11 points adrift of the Reds. Asked if he could lift his players for a mammoth challenge, Guardiola said: ""We have to, we have to. It's my job.""  Pep Guardiola refused to single out any of his Manchester City players for criticism but admitted their 3-3 Champions League draw with Feyenoord was ""difficult to swallow.""

A brace from Erling Haaland and a goal from Ilkay Gundogan had City cruising before Anis Hadj Moussa pulled one back for Feyenoord in the 75th minute when he pounced on a terrible back pass from Josko Gvardiol. Another sloppy pass by the 22-year-old led to Santiago Gimenez making it 3-2 seven minutes later, before David Hancko equalised for the Dutch side in the 89th minute. ""He is so young, he'll learn,"" Guardiola said of Gvardiol, who looked distraught after Feyenoord's second goal.  ""I'll be so wrong if I point specific things at him. He's a fantastic player, a fantastic boy and more than ever must be helped."" At the end of the game the crowd booed City, who dropped to 15th in the 36-team standings on eight points, two points adrift of the top eight, who qualify automatically for the last 16. ""They come here not to remember the success in the past, but to see the team win,"" Guardiola said of City's supporters. ""Of course they are completely right to express what they feel. Of course (they are) disappointed."" Guardiola's side next face one of their toughest tests of the season when they visit Premier League leaders Liverpool on Sunday. A loss would leave City 11 points adrift of the Reds. Asked if he could lift his players for a mammoth challenge, Guardiola said: ""We have to, we have to. It's my job.""  © Copyright 2024 FotMob","After Feyenoord fought back to draw 3-3 with Manchester City, a shell-shocked Pep Guardiola refused to criticise any of his players."

 Wednesday 27 November 2024 06:15, UK Manchester City's woes continued as they surrendered a three-goal lead to draw 3-3 with Feyenoord and make it six games without a win for Pep Guardiola's side. Guardiola, enduring his worst run as a coach, seemed on course to see his side cruise to victory in this Champions League tie when two goals from Erling Haaland either side of half-time sandwiched Ilkay Gundogan's deflected volley. But there was late drama. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Anis Hadj Moussa seized upon a defensive error by Josko Gvardiol to pull the first goal back on 75 minutes before substitute Santiago Gimenez converted from close range to set nerves jangling. David Hancko headed in the equaliser to leave City bereft. Man City: Ederson (5), Lewis (6), Akanji (5), Ake (7), Gvardiol (5), Gundogan (7), Silva (5), Nunes (7), Foden (7), Grealish (5), Haaland (7).


Subs: De Bruyne (6), Simpson-Pusey (6), McAtee (6).


Feyenoord: Wellenreuther (7), Nieuwkoop (6), Trauner (6), Hancko (7), Smal (6), Hwang (7), Milambo (6), Timber (6), Hadj Moussa (8), Carranza (6), Paixao (7).


Subs: Beelen (7), Zerrouki (7), Gimenez (7), Lotomba (7), Gonzalez (n/a).


Player of the match: Anis Hadj Moussa.
 It was an extraordinary collapse, a draw that ends their five-game losing streak but will feel like a defeat given the remarkable circumstances. City remain outside the top eight in the Champions League. More worryingly, the slump in form shows no signs of ending. It had looked likely to be a routine win, a confidence-boosting result to get City back on course after their recent malaise. This result will only add to the questions facing Guardiola, a hapless collapse that suggests this team has lost what it once had. Nobody in the stadium saw it coming, as evidenced by Guardiola's decision to bring on Jahmai Simpson-Pusey and James McAtee alongside Kevin De Bruyne when three up midway through the second half. He thought it was over, thoughts turning to Liverpool, live on Sky Sports on Sunday Feyenoord had other ideas, but they had help. Gvardiol's casual back-pass was inexplicable. Ederson was poor for all of the goals. And while there were youngsters on the pitch, there was also De Bruyne, Haaland, Bernardo Silva and Jack Grealish.

             Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola made three changes to the side thrashed by Tottenham on Saturday. John Stones was replaced by Nathan Ake, while Kyle Walker dropped to the bench, with Matheus Nunes coming in. Savinho made way for Jack Grealish. All looked shocked at the end, as if victims of circumstances they cannot explain. Doubts that were creeping in are now flooding the mind. Fifteenth in the Champions League table, they go to Anfield knowing defeat there will increase the gap to the Premier League leaders to 11 points. This is officially a crisis. Man City boss Pep Guardiola speaking in the press conference… ""It is not necessary to say anything to them [the players], they know it perfectly. Three episodes did not allow us to win. It is what it is. It is difficult to swallow right now. The game was good, scored three, could have scored more. ""We give away three, especially the first one. We were not able to control the last minutes. ""The team was so committed. But the moment something happens, the team is not strong enough. ""We are not able to win games. We were always a team that found a way. ""What can we do? Rest one or two days and prepare for Anfield."" Asked about the boos from the crowd at the final whistle… ""The last game against Tottenham, 0-4, they were there, applause. They don't come here to remember the past, they come here to see the team perform. Of course, they are completely right to express how they feel."" Feyenoord head coach Brian Priske speaking in the press conference… ""If you are from Feyenoord Rotterdam, it is an unbelievable evening, 3-0 down away from home against, for me, still the best team in the world. ""Obviously you always believe, but it was a difficult game. The first 25 minutes, they played fast football, we were not as tight as we wanted, ended up too low. ""At 3-0 down, you definitely think this is going to be long night, tough evening, but without any tactical [changes], just individual quality, moments, gave us the draw. ""The players stayed in the game, kept pushing and kept believing. I can only praise them."" Tom from Southampton became a millionaire for free with Super 6! Could you be the next jackpot winner?

 PSG were statistically handed the hardest set of eight Champions League fixtures and currently sit outside the top 24 after four games played; Conversely, Aston Villa were handed a favourable set of matches and lie in the last-16 automatic qualification spots 
@Ben_Islington
 Tuesday 26 November 2024 23:47, UK We've reached the midway point of the first installation of the new league phase in the Champions League. So what have we learned about the new format? UEFA tore up the rulebook at the start of this season, ditching the traditional eight groups of four in the group stage with a new 'Swiss-style' 36-team league format. The top eight sides in the league will qualify automatically for the last 16, while the teams finishing in ninth to 24th place will compete in a two-legged play-off against each other to join the top eight teams in that round of the competition. Several voices within Sky Sports debated the topic of whether the new format is working ahead of matchweek three - but one aspect which is now becoming more intriguing is the extent to which the current league standings is reflective of the difficulty ranking of fixtures for each of the 36 teams involved. Many onlookers have already been sold, advocating the notion of not playing the same team twice, and pointing to the surprise results - namely Sporting's win over Manchester City, Lille's victory over champions Real Madrid and Aston Villa's triumph over Bayern Munich - as evidence in favour of the new format. Paris Saint-Germain have the hardest Champions League fixtures in Pot 1 based on the average UEFA coefficient of the teams they drew.


Average coefficient:  69.625 across the eight games.


Teams drawn:  Bayern Munich, Manchester City, Atletico Madrid, and Arsenal. 


The coefficient rankings are based on points gained by clubs in the Champions League, Europa League, and Conference League over the past five seasons:


Points: Two points for a win, one point for a draw, and points are halved in the qualifying rounds.


Bonus points: Five bonus points for making the last 16 of the Champions League, and one more point for each further round.
 It has led to a scenario where Madrid - beaten at home by AC Milan last time out - face increasing jeopardy over their participation in the knockout rounds, especially if they were to be on the end of a bad result again away to Liverpool this week. Madrid were in fact handed the easiest draw among the Pot One clubs, with an average coefficient of 56.000.

             But that puts even more scrutiny on comparing just how difficult one team might have it compared to another side, who might even have been in Pot Four and not participated in a previous Champions League. So, looking back to September, who got a touch when the draw was made? Well, based on the average five-year coefficient, Feyenoord were handed the stiffest set of eight games to negotiate. The Dutch club - who finished second in last season's Eredivisie - didn't get off to the best of starts, losing 4-0 at home to Xabi Alonso's Bayer Leverkusen. Faced with an uphill struggle to even gain qualification for a play-off spot, Feyenoord have rallied to earn victories away at Girona and Benfica, before their progress was derailed by a disappointing 3-1 home defeat by RB Salzburg. The stunning comeback to draw 3-3 at Manchester City means their hopes are in the balance, with home encounters with Sparta Prague and Bayern Munich to come before finishing off at Lille. Of the top 10 teams to statistically have the toughest set of fixtures, only Inter Milan currently sit inside the top eight. Five of them are currently in the elimination spots between 25th and 36th. Conversely, if we look at the teams with - on paper - the kindest schedules, what is noticeable is that No 1 ranked Young Boys have lost all five of their games so far - but they still have away trips to Stuttgart and Celtic sandwiched in between a home tie and Red Star. In the previous format, losing your first five games would certainly mean elimination, but the Swiss side could still finish inside the top 24 teams based on having games against relatively modest opposition. The same can be said for current Austrian champions Sturm Graz, positioned one place above them but also on zero points from four games. Is this what the new format intended to create? More games that matter? Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  There are other teams who have wasted no time in taking advantage of favourable fixtures. Aston Villa won their opening three games before falling to a disappointing 1-0 defeat at Club Brugge last time out. But victories over Young Boys, a weakened Bayern Munich and Bologna have put Unai Emery's side in a strong position to reach the play-offs at the very least. Of the 10 teams to have the statistically easiest run of fixtures, three sides sat inside the coveted top eight spots heading into the matchweek - Villa, Monaco and Borussia Dortmund. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Atalanta are unbeaten and have now moved inside it, along with Arsenal. In Celtic's case, the Scottish champions have won twice as many games as in their last two group stage appearances combined. Brendan Rodgers' side will be confident of earning a play-off spot given their kind run of games - with a home tie with Club Brugge and a trip to Dinamo Zagreb next - and that's despite a 7-1 trouncing in Dortmund. Hosting Young Boys after the Christmas break almost feels like an unnecessary safety net. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The more Champions League football played this season, the more we learn about whether the new format will in time be viewed as a success. Talk of the unknown in these opening rounds has always been prefaced with a longing for a frenetic final set of games all played at the same time. Football's very own NFL RedZone. But the sceptics will always point towards the early lack of jeopardy, where weakened sides have tarnished supposed blue ribbon events. Liverpool's blistering start has made the visit of Real Madrid this week by far the least important of their priorities. No one at Arsenal - having lost title ground in the Premier League - talks now of the time they beat Paris Saint-Germain, whose struggles were expected based on having the fourth toughest set of fixtures - despite reaching last season's semi-finals. The Ligue 1 champions have been faced with an average coefficient across eight games of 69.625. The dream of lifting the Champions League trophy has never felt so far from becoming a reality under their Qatari owners, largely based on how they have performed, but partly as a result of who they have played and because three of their remaining four games are away from home. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Another discussion that will soon emerge is whether it matters if a team finishes first or eighth in the automatic qualification spots. Similarly, if finishing ninth is any different to finishing in 24th. The answer is 'yes'. To try to ensure every game matters through to the final day, UEFA has connected a club's final league placing to the knockout bracket, meaning where a club finishes affects their path. The higher you are placed, the easier the route (based on league ranking) through to the final. For instance, clubs ranked 1-8 will play the second leg of their last-16 tie at home. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  If a team finishes in ninth position, the disappointment of narrowly missing out automatically advancing to the last 16 could be softened by being drawn to face the team that finished in 23rd or 24th position. Likewise, teams who finish in first and second cannot play each other until the final; those who are third and fourth would avoid first and second until the semi-finals. At this stage, teams will solely be focused on collecting as many points as possible but given how everything is inter-linked, there could come a point where managers start to plot the best path to the final. For now, those permutations are for another day, but the opening four rounds of fixtures have certainly raised questions over whether the new format has created an unfair playing field. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  A new format brings new expectations in the Champions League this season, with clubs looking at the mathematics to see how many points they would need to qualify for the knockout rounds in the league phase structure. The Opta supercomputer believes 16 points from a possible 24 - so five wins and a draw from eight matches, or other combinations - would almost certainly be enough to finish in the top eight, which guarantees you a last-16 spot in the New Year. The data also believes 15 points - so five wins from eight games, or other combinations - could be enough to sneak into eighth place, with that points tally being enough in 73 per cent of Opta's 50,000 simulations of the league phase. Fourteen points, so four wins and two draws or other combinations, is unlikely to be enough for a top-eight finish - so the race to five wins is likely to be the target for the biggest sides. To finish in the top 24, which guarantees you a play-off spot at least, Opta believes 10 points - so three wins and a draw, or other combinations - will almost certainly guarantee you a place in that round. It means teams who win in the opening round of Champions League fixtures need just seven points from the remaining seven games to guarantee themselves a play-off spot. Nine points - so three wins from eight games, or other combinations - could be enough to finish 24th, with that points tally being enough in 69 per cent of the simulations. But just eight points - so two wins and two draws, or other combinations - runs the risk of elimination, with that points tally being sufficient in just 16 per cent of the simulations. Teams will be targeting at least three wins from eight to give them the best possible chance of reaching the Champions League knockout rounds.

City's losing streak stretched to five matches when Tottenham stunned the Premier League champions with a 4-0 win at the Etihad on Saturday, marking the first time Guardiola has lost five games in a row in his managerial career. It is also the first time the club have lost five consecutive matches in all competitions since April 2006. In fact, City are the first reigning top-flight champions to lose five games in a row in all competitions since Chelsea in March 1956. Their campaign has been hindered by a rash of injuries, with Ballon d'Or winner Rodri, Ruben Dias, Mateo Kovacic, Jeremy Doku and Oscar Bobb among those currently on the sidelines.  Guardiola, who signed a two-year contract extension at City last week, has led them to 18 major trophies, including six Premier League titles and a Champions League crown, and urged the team to stick to their philosophy. ""Look at where we've come from. It's so difficult to defend the success we have had, that's why I'm so relaxed. That is why I want the commitment, the commitment, the commitment and the commitment,"" Guardiola told reporters on Monday. ""Just being ourselves isn't enough, we have to show commitment every day. ""Just because this team won a lot, a lot, a lot for many, many, many years. I think in the situation, we have to go direct to our principles, change less more than ever. ""We create a lot of chances. We're not winning the duels. We have to run backwards because our first centre-backs are not there. Rodri is not there. ""We normally play four central defenders, but we have injuries, we had to play [Ilkay] Gundogan, our best attacking midfielder, as a defensive midfielder because of injuries ... What do we have to do? Insist. If not Tuesday, next Sunday. If not, the next game. We keep trying."" City are currently eight points adrift of leaders Liverpool, who they face on Sunday, in the Premier League, and Guardiola said his side were not, at present, ready to win the league but stressed that this phase will pass. ""We need to win one game. I want the players to perform well. In certain departments, we need more focus. It will pass. It's going to rain tomorrow, life goes on,"" he added. City are 10th in the 36-team Champions League table with seven points from four games, two points off the automatic qualification places. Feyenoord are a point behind in 21st. After drawing their opener in the competition, Guardiola's side recorded big wins over Slovan Bratislava and Sparta Prague before falling to Sporting CP in their most recent outing. Asked how he planned to turn City's form around, the Spaniard said: ""Prepare for the next game, try to beat them, which is Feyenoord. I don't know any other way.

Sanches suffered a hamstring injury in training last month and missed Benfica's last six matches, including their wins over Red Star Belgrade and Atletico Madrid in their opening two Champions League matches. ""Let's be very clear about this, because we have nothing to hide. Renato has been doing a lot of work. We had predicted that he could return a little earlier, then a little later, but I can confirm that Renato will be involved for the game against Feyenoord,"" Lage said. Sanches, who was a teenage prodigy at Benfica, has struggled for consistency since his record transfer to Bayern Munich aged 18 in 2016.

Lage said only defensive midfielder Leandro Barreiro would be missing from the Benfica lineup for the match due to a thigh injury. Benfica are on a run of six successive victories, with their 4-0 home win over Atletico earlier this month one of the surprise results of the early stages of the new-look Champions League competition. ""It is important to highlight that the work we did ahead of the Atletico match happens for every game,"" Lage said. ""First, we understand what we did well in our previous game, and we study the opponent in detail. We define the strategy, practise it and look to instil confidence in the players. That's what we do for every game, be it in the championship, in the Champions League or in the cup.

The side have made plenty in transfer sales in recent years thanks to some young talent. Ecuadorian defender Joel Ordonez looks set to be the latest to bring in large sums to West Flanders. As reported by Het Nieuwsblad, the likes of Chelsea and Liverpool have shown interest in signing the 20-year-old. However, while a winter transfer is possible, head coach Nicky Hayen would rather it was delayed a few months.  Speaking ahead of the sides clash with Sporting in the Champions League, Hayen said ‘When that transfer will happen, you can’t control that. It could be in the winter, but it could also be after this season, which we would prefer’. There are other sides outside of the two Premier League sides that are interested, with some already in contact with Club Brugge over the signing of the defender. It is likely that, if possible, the side would try and keep him in Belgium on loan if a big fee were to be agreed this winter.  Ordonez has played 18 times for the side this season, scoring once. 12 of these appearances have been in the Pro League, while a further five have come in the Champions League. The young defender joined Club Brugge as a teenager in 2022 from Ecuadorian side Independiente del Valle. He has already been capped by Ecuador at senior level.

A win would draw them level on points with the Portuguese side and cement their position in the top 24, while also giving them a chance of making it into the top eight.  Club come into the clash off the back of a late win over KV Mechelen. Despite conceding in injury time, the defending Belgian champions then rallied to get themselves back in front late on. They can ill afford such late game drama against this Sporting side. Club also need to ensure they are more efficient in European competitions. They could have easily beaten Celtic if they had taken their first half chances, while their victory over Sturm Graz could also have been more convincing for the same reason. In the striking department, the side can at least count on the return of their Swedish striker Gustaf Nilsson.  Sporting are averaging two goals per game in the competition this season, winning three of their five matches. This included a 4-1 win over Manchester City with a hat-trick from Viktor Gyökeres. The 26-year-old has already scored 17 league goals in just 13 games this season, with another five in the Champions League. However, the side did suffer a defeat last time out in the competition when they lost 5-1 to Arsenal. They have since lost 1-0 to Santa Clara and 2-1 to Moreirense.  Sporting finish their Champions League campaign against RB Leipzig and Bologna, while Club face Manchester City and Juventus.  GBeNeFN | Ben Jackson  @2023 - All Rights Reserved. Get Football Group",

Mechelen have only lost twice at home in eight games, scoring a league best 22 goals in those matches as well. However, the side have only won one of their past five matches, which came at home against struggling Beerschot. Club, on the other hand, are unbeaten in their last nine matches in all competitions.  Mechelen are coming into this clash off a disappointing week. They lost 3-1 away in Kortrijk before being dumped out of the cup on penalties by Beerschot. The side are usually a strong cup team and would have fancied having a crack at the trophy once again this season. They have done well against Club Brugge in recent times, drawing the last three matches between the two sides. Benito Raman has been in great form for the team, with four of his five goals for the side coming in his past five matches.  Club have scored 11 goals in their past two league matches and have the best away record in the league. They side have won four of their eight games, losing just two. Christos Tzolis and Andreas Skov Olsen lead the side with six goals apiece in the league, while Hans Vanaken has grabbed five goals and five assists so far this season.

The former Celtic, Manchester City and Hertha Berlin defender has been out of favour for months now, being forced to train alone and not allowed contact with the first team. Boyata explained the situation ‘They want me to change in a small room where the cleaning crew keeps their stuff. I refuse. I pick up my clothes there and just do it in the locker room. And because I’m only allowed to train in the afternoon, I can’t eat at the club anymore. That way they want to make sure that I have no contact with my teammates in any way. It’s like I have a hyper-contagious disease‘.  The experienced defender went on to say how he is not even allowed to play for the sides second team, Club NXT, who participate in the Belgian second tier. He is also not allowed to take part in friendlies. Boyata was clear in how he feels about how he has been treated, telling Sporza ‘The way I’m treated is disrespectful to me. Should I feel valued because I can still use the club’s facilities? They say they respect me, but that doesn’t show in the way they treat me’. Yet for the football team, the situation is clear. Boyata is one of the highest earners at the club and has not lived up to that on the pitch. His performances since joining from Hertha Berlin in 2022 have not been at the level many would have hoped, with him now slipping further and further down the pecking order. The side came out and said that they offered Boyata a contract termination in August, with 20% compensation of his reported €3m per year deal. However, Boyata refused that as he did not want to go abroad. The side have also stated that Boyata knew the situation all summer and that he was allowed to train with the first team and take part in pre-season friendlies to help find a move.  By September, as reported by Boyata, the club offered a compensation of 55-60%. Again, the defender refused this. His reasoning was that he would have had to go to Saudi Arabia or Turkey, while he also would not have been eligible to sign for another team until January, something he claims Club Brugge did not realise.  Now it appears that Boyata will have to see out the current situation until his contract expires in the summer. Club would clearly love to sell him, perhaps even allowing him to leave on a free in January. Whether he will be willing to take a reduction in wages to do so will certainly influence who many sympathize with in this saga.  GBeNeFN | Ben Jackson @2023 - All Rights Reserved.

We were much more courageous in the second half. ""So, so pleased with the second half. We kept going, showed determination right to the end.

Charleroi are certainly one of those sides, as they slip further into trouble. Club Brugge will hope that Union can do them a favour against Genk to close the gap at the top.  Sint Truiden v Mechelen A frustrated Sint Truiden welcome Mechelen to the Stayen on Friday evening. The side were wrongly denied an equaliser against Standard Liege last weekend as a good run of form came to an end. Mechelen rescued a point late on in their game last weekend against Union. Last season the Canaries won all four games that the sides played against each other in the regular season and the play offs.  Kortrijk v Antwerp Antwerp have been in good form against sides that are not considered to be title challengers this season. Kortrijk are certainly a side they will fancy their chances against. Despite a win over Beerschot, the side were lackluster against Anderlecht last weekend a rarely troubled Colin Coosemans in goal. The side are yet to reach double figures for goals this season, whereas their opponents already have 25.  Dender v OH Leuven Dender are struggling after a decent start to the season, with just one win in their last five. OH Leuven have also only won noe of their last five in the league. Both sides recent wins were against Charleroi, and both would have circled this one as a winnable game when the fixtures were announced. OH Leuven should have taken a point or three at home to Club Brugge last weekend, whereas Dender are also struggling to convert chances. This could be a low scoring affair.  Charleroi v Westerlo  Charleroi are in a terrible state. The side are spiralling into a relegation battle and now welcome Rik De Mil’s former side Westerlo on Saturday evening. Fans are already planning a 12 minute protest prior to the game, not entering the stadium until the 13th minute. The side have looked beyond poor in their last few games, whereas Westerlo have performed well even without getting many points, apart from lats weekend against Dender. They will fancy heaping more misery on the Zebras this weekend.  Cercle Brugge v Anderlecht Anderlecht travel to Brugge with a growing injury list. Neither Ludwig Augustinsson nor Leander Dendoncker travelled to Latvia for the Europa League clash with RFS. Both sides drew their European matches during the week, with 10 man Cercle holding out against LASK in Austria. Anderlecht looked to have secured a late win over RFS, only for a Moussa N’Diaye own goal in stoppage time seeing them leave Latvia with just a point.  Gent v Standard Liege Gent edged out Omonia Nicosia during the week thanks to goalkeeper Davy Roef. The goalkeeper might be busy against Standard, although their ability to take their chances has been lacking. Gent should, if they have any ambitions of challenging for the title, be able to beat a poor Standard side at home. However, the problems of inconsistency that have plagued the side in recent seasons appear to still be there in 2024.  Union St Gilloise v Genk Genk are looking like the team to beat this season. They have won each of their last three games 2-0 and were comfortable in all of these. Union on the other hand are struggling. They played well against Roma in the Europa League, but could not grab all three points. Goals have been hard to come by for the Brussels based side, not something that Genk have struggled with. However, in the past, this is the sort of game that Union would rise to.  Beerschot v Club Brugge Beerschot have a huge challenge on Sunday evening. Club Brugge were excellent in the week beating Aston Villa in the Champions League and will hope to coast through to victory over the basement side this weekend. Beerschot showed signs of life against Anderlecht a few weeks ago and have only lost one of their last five matches. Club, on the other hand, have won four on the bounce. Beerschot are already facing a gap of nine points to safety.  GBeNeFN | Ben Jackson – Author of The Africa Cup of Nations: The History of an Underappreciated Tournament @2023 - All Rights Reserved.

Real Madrid midfielder Eduardo Camavinga expressed his happiness at having played 100 league matches for Real Madrid after the draw with Rayo Vallecano at Vallecas.

They now have to quickly turn their attention to the Intercontinental Cup final, which will be played this week against Pachuca on Wednesday. Camavinga was asked about the game, to which he said: “The Intercontinental Cup match is important for us, we play here to be in this kind of matches. We know we have to win this title and we are going for the win.” The Frenchman was also asked what lies ahead in the season, to which he gave a positive response. He said: “We are only in the first half of the season and we have to give our all in the second.”  Check your inbox for a welcome email. Oops. Something went wrong.

Rodrygo then gave Los Blancos the lead, but Isi Palazón equalised for the home side only eight minutes later and neither side was able to find a winner on the night.  1. Would Vinícius be ready to start two games so close together? After several weeks on the sidelines, Vinícius Júnior exploded back onto the scene in Italy in midweek as he got himself on the scoresheet in the 3-2 win over Atalanta. However, with this being the first of three remaining games in a week before the winter break, there were question marks over whether the Brazilian would be risked in such close succession to the game in the Champions League. Carlo Ancelotti decided not to take any risks, instead benching Vini in order to give him a rest. The coach probably didn’t want to be forced to bring him into the action just after the hour mark, and you could see why. Vini did create one fantastic chance, and produced one late shot on target, but looked frustrated and lacking the slight edge which makes his game so unique. The yellow card, his fifth of the season in La Liga and earning him a suspension, was needless. The benefit of that suspension is that he’ll only play one more game between now and early January. A two week break after the Intercontinental Cup final against Pachuca could do him good. 2. Who would play at right-back? Lucas Vázquez has struggled since he came into the team to replace Dani Carvajal following his long-term injury earlier this season. There was talk after the game against Atalanta that Carlo Ancelotti could consider alternatives, with Fede Valverde and Raúl Asencio among those suggested, but the Italian stuck with his veteran 33-year-old. However, Vázquez did little to support his own case. All three goals conceded came down Real Madrid’s right flank, and the first two Rayo Vallecano goals directly involved Vázquez being beaten in the air as Rayo seemed to be targeting him directly with his lack of aerial presence. It was a tactic which worked for them and Real Madrid did nothing to address it. 3. Would Vallecas prove a banana skin once again? Before this game, Real Madrid hadn’t won in either of their previous two visits to the south of the Spanish capital and the Estadio Municipal de Vallecas. A 1-0 win in 2022, courtesy of an 83rd minute strike from Karim Benzema, was the only time that Real Madrid have won their since 2016. It is no surprise that heading into the cauldron that is Vallecas, one of the tightest and most compact stadiums in La Liga with one of the most raucous supports, proves to be a challenge for Real Madrid. That’s even more accurate when it’s the case that Real Madrid are fielding a number of players who may not usually be featuring in these positions. The side has looked prone to defensive mistakes of late, and the high press set up from Rayo forced not only mistakes defensively, but also to prevent Real Madrid from building up play fluidly. A third game at Vallecas without a win is an unsurprising streak of poor results from Real Madrid at one of their cursed grounds.   1. How should Carlo Ancelotti line up when his two stars aren’t available? Carlo Ancelotti seems as lost as anyone as to how to set up his team this season. Whereas the full duration of last season was played with slight variations of the same 4-3-3 system, this campaign has already seen a wide range of shapes and structures. This time, we saw perhaps the most unpredictable, with Brahim Díaz, Arda Güler, Rodrygo Goes and Jude Bellingham all taking up offensive roles. The system struggled, which may not be a surprise given that the players could not have trained with such a system more than twice during the course of the week after midweek Champions League action. In any case, the yellow card for Vinícius means that Ancelotti will have to do it again when the team take on Sevilla next weekend for the final La Liga game of 2024. It will be intriguing to see if Ancelotti sticks with the same system he used here again or if he mixes things up.  2. Did Rodrygo prove himself as capable? One of the positives of the night was the role of Rodrygo Goes, himself starting for the first time since his latest injury set-back. It was only his third start since early November, but the Brazilian seemed to step up in the absence of his usual forward line companions. He led the stats in terms of completed dribbles with four, and chances created with three. He also provided the cross for Jude Bellingham’s equalising header on the stroke of half-time and then gave Los Blancos the lead early in the second half with a wonderful individual goal, finding a yard of space on a crowded edge of the box and then placing the ball into the top corner. If Real Madrid need goals and need to find a way of scoring without Vinícius and Mbappé, Rodrygo is their next best bet and he’s living up to expectations.   3. Where would Real Madrid be without Jude Bellingham? At times this season, it has felt like Bellingham is Real Madrid’s best attacker, best midfielder, and even best defender. He has proved to be the man for the big moment time and time again and did so again at Vallecas, appearing at just the right time to equalise on the stroke of half-time with a crucial header. Bellingham looks tireless and continues to improve and seems to be gaining more and more momentum as the season goes on, but there is a story to be learned from 2023/24. Last season, he was also on fire at this stage of the season, but quickly tired as the season moved to its closing stages. Now may not be the time to rest Bellingham, given the number of offensive players already unavailable, but Ancelotti must consider how to manage the game time of such a key player to avoid running him into the ground before the business end of the season.

This came after a rousing comeback from two goals down to 3-2 up was ultimately cancelled out by Rayo’s Isi Palazón. Amongst those to have shone for Real Madrid, despite the eventual result, was the aformentioned Arda Güler. Afforded his latest starting berth at Vallecas, youngster Güler responded by laying on a pair of assists, first for Federico Valverde, and then Rodrygo. And, as alluded to above, post-match, the Turk’s influence carried over onto social media.

When all was said and done, it was the Blaugrana who emerged triumphant, by two goals to one. And, on a day which saw Xavi and Andrés Iniesta reunite on the pitch, both played leading roles in their side’s eventual victory. First, during the first-half, the former’s gorgeous back-heeled pass opened up the Real Madrid backline, allowing Ludovic Giuly to square for Javier Saviola to slot home. Then, deep into injury-time, with the scoreline locked at 1-1, it was the turn of Iniesta to prove himself decisive. After being slipped in towards the endline, midfielder Iniesta, fresh off retiring from the game at professional level, saw his clipped cross sliced into his own net by Fernando Sanz.

Reflecting on Saturday's game, in which Pachuca managed just 11 shots and 0.67 expected goals (xG) to Al Ahly's 15 shots and 1.37 xG, Almada added: ""We were a little exhausted because of the intensity we required in the game against Botafogo.  ""Fortunately, we achieved this win with a marathon penalty shoot-out, but in the end what matters is the character we showed. That is very important for us. ""We maintained defensive security and that is to be recognised, but we didn't string together passes or generate scoring options."" © Copyright 2024 FotMob","Pachuca will be Real Madrid's opponents for the final of the inaugural FIFA Intercontinental Cup, after overcoming Al Ahly on spot-kicks."

This comes owing to the Italian’s comments in the aftermath of Real Madrid’s La Liga meeting with Rayo Vallecano. Los Blancos of course marked their return to action on Saturday night, making the trip to Vallecas for a clash with the aforementioned Rayo. When all was said and done, they were forced to make do with a share of the spoils, owing to a chaotic 3-3 stalemate. One individual who did not appear to be overly disappointed with as much, though, was Real headmaster Carlo Ancelotti. In a round of post-match comments which have since not gone down at all well amongst those of a Blancos persuasion, Ancelotti admitted that he was ‘satisfied’ with the outcome on Saturday: “We’re on the right track and I’m satisfied. We competed well tonight. This draw is not as bad as the one against Las Palmas, or Mallorca. This one was better.” Conor Laird – GSFN @2023 - All Rights Reserved. Get Football Group",

This comes with the latter, for his part, fresh off keeping alive a remarkable recent stretch in front of goal last night. Afforded a starting berth in Real Madrid’s La Liga meeting with Rayo Vallecano, Bellingham notched his sixth goal in as many league appearances. And though as much did not prove enough to guide Carlo Ancelotti’s squad to an eventual victory, the youngster’s exploits have nevertheless garnered widespread praise across the Spanish football landscape. In fact, adding his name to the list of Bellingham’s many appreciators earlier today was none other than a Blancos legend. Taking to the comments section of the 21-year-old’s latest Instagram post, Toni Kroos, who of course spent last season lining out alongside Bellingham in Spain’s capital, wrote: ‘What a Player’ Toni Kroos replies to Bellingham. 🥲🤍 pic.twitter.com/WPZQX8iiIX Conor Laird – GSFN @2023 - All Rights Reserved.

Full match player ratings below: Thibaut Courtois—5: Felt positioning could have been better on the goals conceded.  Lucas Vazquez—3: Continues to struggle defensively, with poor communication between the backline and midfield on the first goal conceded.  Tchouameni—5.5: Strong in aerial duels and recovering his position in transition but can take team out of shape on occasion.   Rudiger—4: Poor game by the German’s lofty standards. Fell asleep on Rayo’s third goal.  Fran Garcia—5: Turned inside out by Jorge De Frutos on the opening goal.  Luka Modric—5: Some excellent passes out of pressure but never fully controlled the game and looked a step slow.  Fede Valverde—7: Scored a brilliant goal from outside the box, perfectly struck, to start the comeback.  Arda Guler—7: Recorded two assists and made several crucial toe poke interceptions defensively.  Jude Bellingham—8.5: Copy and paste: Real Madrid’s best player once again — came up big with a seventh consecutive goal in all competitions and was the equalizer before halftime after going 2-0 down.  Brahim—6: Some good turns when under pressure but not enough involvement the match.  Rodrygo—8.5: Up there with Jude Bellingham for man of the match on the Madrid side. Produced a perfect assist to Bellingham with an in-swinging cross and then scored one of his own with a weak footed shot past Batalla.   Substitutions: Vinicius Junior—6.5: Lost his head early and got a quick yellow, meaning he will miss the next match through suspension. Nearly scored and nearly had a headed assist in the final minutes but Rudiger failed to convert.  Eduardo Camavinga—6: First game back since the latest injury and showed some lovely footwork in the middle of midfield.  Dani Ceballos—N/A: Played the last 10 minutes as Madrid searched for a late winner.  Endrick—N/A: Late substitution with only 4 touches.   Check your inbox for a welcome email. Oops.

Winning the Intercontinental Cup would be the icing on the cake this year.” “I was nervous about the one in Mallorca, the one in Las Palmas... they had affected me a lot, this one didn’t.

We are not a tall team. Sometimes you have to suffer and we suffered in that sense. We started without many starters.

Celtic finished off Rangers in a dramatic Hampden penalty shootout where Kasper Schmeichel and Daizen Maeda were Celtic’s heroes of the hour. Celtic ‘keeper Schmeichel saved a Rangers penalty as golden Bhoy, Daizen Maeda converted his spot kick to ensure the Hoops’ 119th trophy in their history rests in the Parkhead boardroom tonight. And self-confessed Celtic fan, Stan Collymore, has sent a message to the Parkhead after their historic Hampden win.  Collymore said on X, “Congratulations to the players, staff and supporters of Celtic Football Club.

Brendan Rodgers was delighted as he said of Celtic beating Rangers, “It was an exciting game for the neutral to see. As I said, the goals at the end, but to come out the other side of it, the guys with the penalties were fantastic as well. Kasper makes the save and we pulled through in the end.” Former Celtic striker Chris Sutton instantly said of Celtic’s win, “Well played Celtic and Brendan Rodgers, absolutely relentless,” wrote Sutton. “Another moral victory maybe for Rangers though…” Finally, Rangers boss Philippe Clement had a weird take on Celtic’s victory with a bitter penalty rant, “There’s also a penalty situation on Czerny. So it’s a weird one that the referee, at least, is not been asked to go to watch the monitor because we get a free kick at the edge of the box but his foot is on the line so it’s a clear penalty. “At least it’s a discussion at least for the referee to take.” No doubt there will be even more fresh takes over Celtic’s win as the Hampden fallout continues for the rest of next week.",

It wasn’t the best of starts from Celtic as they were passive, slow and lacklustre on the ball in the first half, and it proved to be costly. A Greg Taylor mistake eventually resulted in Nedim Bajrami scoring as Brendan Rodgers watched his players go into the break 1-0 behind. Whatever was said at half-time worked because, by the hour mark, Daizen Maeda had put the Bhoys ahead with a clever run, touch and finish – all after Taylor’s deflected leveller.  But, once again, Celtic shot themselves in the foot and because Rangers were back level again, before the game tussled left and right up until extra time and penalties.  For the neutral, it might have been absorbing, breathtaking and proof why Celtic and Rangers is perhaps the greatest rivalry out there.  But, for those backing the Hoops, including club legend, Pat Bonner, it was full of mixed emotions.  Taylor played 90 minutes before on-loan Barcelona star Alex Valle was introduced into the action for extra-time.  Yes, the Scotland international played a huge role in the equaliser, but some fans were calling for him to be hooked off at half-time.  Bonner certainly wasn’t impressed with Taylor ‘giving the ball away’ and how it simply ‘shouldn’t happen’, as he told BBC Sport.  “It’s Greg Taylor giving the ball away, that square pass,” said Bonner.  “Rangers have been really cute in the way that they’ve actually dealt with that, waiting for the pass across, putting the ball at risk across your midfield cannot happen, shouldn’t happen. A lot has been made of Celtic’s squad depth and there was a huge debate as to who would start in midfield – Paulo Bernardo – who was the preferred choice – or big-money summer signing, Arne Engels. The Belgium international wasn’t on the pitch for long before he was in Bonner’s bad books and the role he played in Mohamed Diomande’s goal. Bonner stated that Engels got ‘bullied’ from a corner and offered another lifeline for the opposition, as he told BBC Sport.  “The ball’s just played in from the corner and it was Diomande, he’s just bullied Engels out of the way,” added Bonner.  “He’s got in front of him.

Brendan Rodgers secured his 10th piece of silverware as the Celtic boss after beating Rangers in a thrilling final that is likely to be talked about for years to come. Celtic’s goals from Greg Taylor equalised Bajrami’s Rangers opener as Daizen Maeda’s strike but Celtic 2-1 up right after halftime. However, Rangers drew level through Diomande in the 75th minute of the game. Nicolas Kuhn scored for Celtic to put them 3-2 up in the 87th minute and the German winger must have thought he had won the cup for the Hoops. However, Rangers equalised immediately to force the game into extra time and penalties and after Celtic hero, Kasper Schmeichel broke Rangers’ hearts, Daizen Maeda delivered the League Cup by converting his penalty to secure the Bhoys’ 119th trophy in their history. Reacting to the defeat, Rangers captain, James Tavernier, admits that the penalty loss to Celtic has given him painful Europa League flashbacks. Tavernier told Premier Sports, “Obviously, flashbacks of Seville in the Europa League final. It’s never nice to lose a game, obviously on penalties.  “But yeah, I’m also proud of the lads who stepped up and man enough to take a penalty, but obviously didn’t go our way.” “We put ourselves in a good position at halftime. Then we want to keep doing the right things. Go out as it’s 0-0 and grab our chances.” And as the Rangers captain continued his analysis of being beaten by the Parkhead club, Tavernier said the word all Celtic fans are now used to hearing after another Glasgow Derby defeat. “We’re obviously disappointed,” Tavernier continued, “With the couple of goals and the manner in how we conceded them, but obviously we put ourselves back in a great position, back in the game. “And then, you know, these games come down to small chances and clinical chances. We had a 4v1 chance in the second half, and they’re the moments where we’ve got to finish it off.  “So there’s a lot to learn from and we can obviously take a lot of out with this game and obviously push forward for next week.” Tavernier’s comments mirror those of Rangers boss, Philippe Clement’s assessment of the defeat to Celtic after the Ibrox gaffer complained about not getting a big decision in the game where he felt his team deserved a penalty. As it stands, Celtic now hold the League Cup trophy and Brendan Rodgers is well on his way to winning another treble with the Parkhead club should he maintain his lead at the top of the Scottish Premiership table and successfully defend his Scottish Cup at the end of the season.",

It was a frantic, exhausting, knackering 120 minutes of football with the added pressure and intensity of a penalty shootout at the end. Thankfully it fell on the Hoops’ side and that means another trophy in the cabinet with a Treble in sight for Brendan Rodgers and his squad. For Rodgers it was his 10th piece of silverware as manager at the club but, as a whole, there was a significant shift in the records where the club are involved in a more general sense. Just last season there was still a narrow lead for the Light Blues in terms of how many trophies they had won compared to the Hoops. A Double for Rodgers and his troops took it to an incredible 118-a-piece heading into this campaign and this evening’s enthralling finale saw Celtic edge ahead of their noisy neighbours at 119-118. It was a hugely dramatic afternoon at Hampden as Celts earned their winners’ medals from an exhilarating 120 minutes plus. Nedim Bajrami had given Rangers the lead following a poor mistake from Greg Taylor inside his own half as the inverted full-back attempted a square-ball out to the right and was caught. It took until the second-half for Celtic to rally and Taylor redeemed himself with a deflected effort. Daizen Maeda then smashed home to make it 2-1 before Mohamed Diomande levelled for the Light Blues. Nicolas Kuhn thought he had won the cup for his side after Arne Engels found him with a cut-back and he swept the ball beyond Jack Butland to make it 3-2 with just three minutes left on the clock. But it took Rangers just 20 seconds after kick-off to net thanks to a Danilo header and we were all square again. Extra-time was a snooze but penalty kicks followed and Celtic ran out 5-4 winners with Maeda and Kasper Schmeichel the heroes. The win might give Celts a lead over Gers in trophies won now but Al-Ahly of Egypt remain the most successful of all time with 124. Chris Sutton brutally mocked Rangers at full-time while their captain, James Tavernier, showed respect by insisting his teammates watch the trophy lift.",

However, for former referee Bobby Madden it was more than that as he declared that the Light Blues should have had a “100 percent penalty” instead of the set-piece they were awarded. Scales had come off the bench to replace Auston Trusty to end Celtic’s “clumsy” build-up play. But the Irishman found himself in a right old mess in extra-time with the scoreline at 3-3 in today’s pulsating Premier Sports Cup Final at Hampden Park. A post shared by Bobby Madden (@bobby_madden_) Scales gave the ball away just outside the Celtic area to Vaclav Cerny before tugging at the Czech’s jersey and hauling the attacker down. Whistler John Beaton blew for a foul and pointed to where the infringement had started which was outside the box. Though Madden, taking to his social media channels as he so often does, insisted it should have been a penalty as the holding carried on into the box – or just on the line – and he reckons it was a definite spot-kick. It is unclear whether VAR took a good look at the incident or not as was debated on Premier Sports by the pundits. Needless to say, Alan Hutton and Scott Arfield both felt it was a penalty. Colour us surprised! But Madden has now weighed in on the situation and had his say as he was adamant VAR should have intervened and corrected a mistake by Beaton. “This is (100 percent) a penalty kick,” Madden wrote on his Instagram page accompanied with a still-image of the pull. “It doesn’t matter when the holding started, when it ended or what direction the players are moving. This is clear evidence of holding within the penalty area and I’m amazed this hasn’t been identified by VAR. “Referee team had been excellent until that point. “Difficult live, but that’s why VAR is there.” We told you how Chris Sutton brutally mocked Rangers at full-time for a ‘moral victory’ despite their defeat.",

Chests were wheezing, legs cramping, hearts fluttering, rain falling. ""Carnage, just carnage"" as the Celtic defender Liam Scales said in the aftermath. The tension, the drama, the lost-soul demeanour of Ridvan Yilmaz as he walked back to the halfway line having had his penalty saved by Kasper Schmeichel. The sight of Jack Butland, the Rangers goalkeeper, then having to score against Schmeichel to keep his team alive in the shoot-out, which he did. Then the suspense as Daizen Maeda stood over that last kick, the big opportunity to finally put a gallant Rangers to sleep, which he took. Unerringly. Maeda carries himself like a man who laughs in the face of pressure, who pokes a finger in the eye of stressful situations such as this. At no point did you really get a feeling that he was going to miss.  That's not being wise after the event. This was in real time. Maeda looked like he was in his element.  He was oh so cool in the final seconds of a final that for big chunks reached epic proportions. Celtic beat Rangers on penalties after epic More Celtic reaction & have your say What are they saying in the Rangers camp? Rangers looked stunned and sickened, as well they might. Of all the blows that Celtic have inflicted on them in recent seasons, this has to be the most painful. Worse, surely, than last season's Scottish Cup final, secured at the death by Adam Idah. That had been a scrap. On that day, Rangers hadn't delivered anything like the goals and moments they came up with on Sunday. More grievous than the Scottish Cup semi-final in April 2023 won by Jota? For sure.  More sickening in its own way than the 3-0s and 4-0s visited upon them in the time of Ange Postecoglou and earlier this season? You have to think so. Those were heavy beatings with no excruciating what-might-have-beens attached. Regret was the difference.  At 1-0 at Hampden on Sunday, and with Celtic a rattled version of their usual selves, Rangers broke free and had a four-on-one. Hamza Igamane was in control of the ball with men running free outside him. Had he made the right decision, it was a one-on-one with Schmeichel from point-blank range. He didn't. He made a bad call. Sliding doors. A possible 2-0 went begging. There was more. Three minutes into the first period of extra time, Scales tugged Vaclav Cerny so microscopically close to the penalty box that Philippe Clement complained later about a lack of VAR intervention. He had a point.  Rangers folk may feel tortured by those what-if moments as much as the missed penalty much later on. As Celtic lifted the trophy, most Rangers fans had already exited, presumably having had a bellyful of disappointment for one day. Only Butland and Cyriel Dessers took it in from the touchline. Suckers for punishment, perhaps. This video can not be played Clement's phone 'overloaded with penalty' incident Rangers had a checklist of things that they had to get right to make a proper final of this and one by one they ticked them off. Score first - they did it having not done it in their previous six games against Celtic.  It was their first goal against Rodgers' team in more than four hours of football, the first time they were ahead against Celtic in more than nine hours. What else was on their must-do sheet?  Shut down the wounding influence of McGregor - they did that.  Show ruthlessness in front of goal - yes.  Silence Kyogo Furuahshi - done.  Bring the intensity and work rate and aggression and character of Thursday against Tottenham to Hampden - achieved, with bells and whistles attached. Tick, tick, tick. Character? They had it in spades.  When Greg Taylor, villain turned hero, and then Maeda transformed a 0-1 into a 2-1, it looked like Celtic had finally got hold of things. We thought we knew which way this was heading at that point, but we hadn't a clue. Nicolas Raskin and Mohamed Diomande had put in towering performances in hustling and harrying and living in the face of a Celtic midfield that has brought ruination to their door so often - and it was Diomande who levelled. With 15 minutes of normal time left, it was 2-2. With three minutes left, it was 3-2 Celtic.  Twenty one seconds after the restart it was 3-3, Danilo's header extending the final and hammering home the point that Rangers have found something of late, a bit of steel and a bit of belief. But no trophy to go with it. This video can not be played 'Most important thing is being on the podium at the end' - Rodgers Incredibly, McGregor has never lost a cup final, but ""it was mighty close today,"" he said. The captain was as relieved as he was honest.  ""The performance wasn't great, so we had to grind it out. We had to hold our nerve. Even when you're not perfect, you can still win. Dig in. Find something extra."" Pyro, predictably, reappeared and kick-off was delayed, two more fingers being raised by the ultras to their own clubs and to the footballing authorities who practically begged them to behave. More charges pending from the SPFL? Let's see. When the action began, it was toe-to-toe. Rangers were physical and uncompromising.  Amid the maelstrom, Taylor lost his head, played a square ball that was a bad idea and also poorly executed in any event and that was the catalyst for the opener. The omens were good for Rangers. Only four teams who have scored first in the last 49 League Cup finals have failed to win the trophy. But stats don't take into account Celtic's steepling self belief. They were in trouble - no space, no control, not many chances - but they found their way out of it. Celtic's mental strength is a thing of wonder. They were nowhere near their best and yet they have another title to their name. The shoot-out came and with it came memories of Rangers' in the Europa League denouement in Seville against Eintracht Frankfurt. Aaron Ramsey, then. Yilmaz now. Schmeichel did his thing. There was gamesmanship in the way he tried to put off some Rangers penalty takers. There were some mocking words in reply from Ianis Hagi after he buried his kick past the Dane.   Ultimately, this odyssey came down to Yilmaz versus Schmeichel and Maeda versus Butland. Celtic won, by a whisker or by a mile, it doesn't really matter.  A different kind of victory from before, but the same feelgood in one dressing room and presumably the same silence and despair in the other. Sporting drama at its best .

There is plenty more of where that came from, as Celtic’s new goalkeeper gets a taste of what it is like representing the greatest club in Scotland. Schmeichel replaced Joe Hart in the summer after previously working under Brendan Rodgers at Leicester City. The 38-year-old would have seen it all during his career, including helping the Foxes become Premier League champions under Claudio Ranieri in 2016. But Celtic’s League Cup final win over Rangers would have been on another scale for the shot-stopper because it had it all. An end-to-end encounter, with six goals, extra-time, and penalties, including his counterpart, Jack Butland taking a spot kick for Rangers during the shootout.  In such a pressure moment, rather than an outfield player taking a penalty, it was Butland who stepped up and put the ball into the back of the net. Butland and Schmeichel have worked together before, so they know each other well and Celtic’s number one wasn’t surprised. The Denmark international hailed Butland as a ‘very confident’ guy and someone who has a high-level technique, as he told Premier Sports.  “That was some experience,” Schmeichel. “Incredible atmosphere, two teams proper going for it. Just very glad it worked out for us in the end.  On if he was ‘surprised’ by Butland taking a penalty: “No, no, listen, I know Jack, he is a very confident guy and he has incredible technique,” added Schmeichel.  “So, his penalty was brilliant. If he can take penalties like that as the last penalty taker under pressure, then fair play to him.” Kasper Schmeichel speaks after playing a major role in @CelticFC's penalty shootout victory against Rangers 🍀""It's a very, very big worldwide followed club and I'm really proud to be here."" 🗣️#PremierSportsCup pic.twitter.com/cKOb1s2Zvi Butland might have scored his penalty, but his job is to save them, which he didn’t so, with Daizen Maeda scoring the winning spot-kick, alongside his four other teammates.  Schmeichel stopped Rıdvan Yılmaz’s penalty and that proved to be the trophy-winning moment. English reporter Henry Winter touched upon Schmeichel’s penalty record on Twitter and how he has saved ‘one in four penalties’ during his career.  “Throughout his long career, Kasper Schmeichel has faced more than 115 pens and averages one save in four,” wrote Henry Winter.  “Salah, Kane, Aguero, Modric, Lukaku & Van Persie all failed against him. Schmeichel continued that form in the Scottish League Cup final, saving from Ridvan Yilmaz.” Throughout his long career, Kasper Schmeichel has faced more than 115 pens and averages one save in four.

Daizen Maeda’s winning penalty sealed Celtic’s 119th trophy of their history to leave Rangers heartbroken after their performance at the national stadium still left Philippe Clement’s side heading home empty-handed. Despite watching his team take the lead and then battle back twice from behind, Clement and James Tavernier still had to watch Celtic stand on the winner’s podium as the Bhoys taste another Hampden triumph over Rangers. Speaking post-match, Clement was clearly gutted as he rambled on about a penalty claim, VAR and the gap between Celtic and Rangers. Clement told Premier Sports, “It’s cruel today. We were the team who got the most chances in the game. “There’s also a penalty situation on Czerny. So it’s a weird one that the referee, at least, is not been asked to go to watch the monitor because we get a free kick at the edge of the box but his foot is on the line so it’s a clear penalty. “At least it’s a discussion at least for the referee to take.” On speaking to the referee, Clement said, “We had a short talk about that and they didn’t get any contact from the VAR to watch the image. So that’s something that people from outside need to discuss and take a look at, I think, why there was no communication about that situation. “But I’m going to be focused on my team and what we need to do for the next weeks, the next months, to become better and better again.” Not satisfied about harping on about a penalty, the Rangers boss then started talking about the gap between his team and Celtic. “We know financially there’s a big gap,” continued Clement, “But the players show today that the gap on the field is not as big as people are talking about the last couple of months. “That this team is growing and getting better. And then that’s what we’re going to do we’re going to focus on that.” Celtic’s trophy count, the gap at the top of the Scottish Premiership and the financial gulf would suggest that Clement is talking more nonsense after being beaten by Celtic in another important domestic fixture. The Rangers boss is now seven games without a win against Celtic as the pressure piles on the Belgian. As for Brendan Rodgers, the Celtic boss was delighted as he watched his team pick up more Hampden silverware.",

The Celtic manager knew something had to give at the break as his side trailed a Nedim Bajrami goal from what was ultimately a poor first-45. It was Trusty who was the man to be sacrificed with Scales coming on to replace him to help aid the build-up play Rodgers wanted his squad to improve on. The move worked, in the end, despite a frantic 3-3 draw which saw Celts go 2-1 ahead thanks to Greg Taylor and Daizen Maeda before Mo Diomande levelled. Nicolas Kuhn thought he had won the tie late on but Danilo levelled just 20 seconds after the restart. Penalties came and went and it was both Maeda and goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel who were the heroes, in the end. Some had speculated that Trusty had perhaps picked up a knock in the first-half but Rodgers, speaking on Premier Sports, revealed it was a tactical tweak to give his side the edge. “I thought we had no cleanliness in our build-up at all,” Rodgers explained. “We looked so clunky and couldn’t get through the pitch. We looked a wee bit edgy. So I didn’t like that, how we cleaned the game up. Scales has been brilliant, to be fair. “He’s clean and Auston Trusty did really, really well. I just felt that he’s had the experience of playing in finals for us now, Liam. I just made that change and he came in and he was able to clean the game up.” It was Rodgers’ 10th trophy as Celtic manager to take the club beyond Rangers in silverware wins. And the manager was chuffed to see the result go his way. “It’s always nice when you come out the other end,” Rodgers added. “I suppose it’s what a final is, you don’t expect everything to go your own way. “I thought Rangers played well in the first half. We had to show a big heart to come back. I think both sets of players made it a really, really exciting game. “But the guys know you want to come out on the right end and thankfully we were able to do that. “These guys have been around it a long time and set the standards as well. So it can never be a disease success. You’ve got to keep fighting, keep working every day, and then hopefully things drop for you. “It was an exciting game for the neutral to see. As I said, the goals at the end, but to come out the other side of it, the guys with the penalties were fantastic as well. Kasper makes the save and we pulled through in the end.”",

After a six-goal thriller after extra-time, Celtic beat Rangers 5-4 on penalties to lift the League Cup at Hampden.  Daizen Maeda netted the winning spot-kick and, rightly so, the thousands of Celtic fans reacted with pure elation and relief after the final kick.  Like all great champions do, they fought, fought and fought until the end and helped produce one of the great Glasgow derby showdowns.  For the Bhoys, it’s a familiar feeling again, another victory over Rangers and another win in such a showpiece final.  Whilst Philippe Clement has only been in Glasgow for a small period to witness Celtic’s dominance, one man who has seen it all has been James Tavernier. But the Rangers skipper’s reaction post-match was rather interesting. As per, the Rangers players went up first to collect their runners-up medal, before the main event of Callum McGregor and Co. lifting their winner’s medals.  Premier Sports presenter Emma Dodds then stated that ‘some Rangers players’ proceeded to go down the tunnel. But Tavernier then stopped them in their traps and asked them to ‘stay out there and watch’ Celtic lift the trophy. “The green and white ribbons on it,” said Dodds. “Rangers lifted it last year, but they couldn’t retain it here this evening. It is Celtic who will go on to lift this trophy after Rangers have been given their runners-up medals.  “Some players staying out there to watch Celtic get the trophy. Some of the players have opted to go up the tunnel and captain James Tavernier has asked the players to stay out there and watch.” It was a touch of class from Tavernier to tell his teammates to stand and appreciate the champions because it’s a sign of respect. When the Rangers players themselves went up for their runners-up medals, they were applauded by some of the Celtic fans, as those on the other side made a quick exit.  Nobody left their seat during the 120 minutes, plus extra time, but when Maeda was wheeling away in celebration, Hampden quickly emptied on one side. ",

What a spectacle it was at Hampden as Celtic beat Rangers on penalties to lift the League Cup and win the first piece of silverware this season.   That wasn’t easy on the heart, but in the end, the Bhoys pulled through, with Daizen Maeda netting the trophy-winning penalty after a six-goal thriller.  It was a sloppy and pretty poor first-half performance from Celtic, with Rangers opening the scoring and the champions being behind at half-time.  But, whatever Brendan Rodgers said at the break worked a treat because his side were a different animal from the get-go. By the hour mark, Celtic were leading 2-1, including a brilliant goal from Maeda, but that’s when punches were thrown back and forth between the two up until extra-time. In the end, it was those in green and white who landed the knockout blow and Chris Sutton was on hand to share his thoughts. You can always count on Sutton to provide that added entertainment and he did just that when Maeda’s penalty hit the back of the net.  The former striker stated on Twitter that Celtic were ‘absolutely relentless’ as they never gave up hope of lifting that trophy. But he then rubbed salt into the wounds by mocking Rangers and how it’s a ‘moral victory’ for them.  “Well played Celtic and Brendan Rodgers, absolutely relentless,” wrote Sutton. “Another moral victory maybe for Rangers though…” Well played Celtic and Brendan Rodgers, absolutely relentless 👏👏☘️🏆 Another moral victory maybe for Rangers though… Another win over Rangers and another trophy for Callum McGregor. The Celtic skipper is just eating them up for fun. McGregor was under the cosh in the first half, but like all great players do, he fought, fought and fought, all the way to victory, including scoring his penalty kick.  After the game, McGregor told Premier Sports that Celtic played ‘nowhere near their level’, as posted by BBC Sport.  “We played nowhere near the level,” said McGregor. “It’s a cup final and there’s nerves that play a part but we didn’t really start playing until 10-15 minutes into the second half. “It was one of those cup ties where anything could happen. Credit to the players they showed so much quality under immense pressure. [I feel] unbelievable pride. It was a tough game, relieved to come through it. “When you come here it’s about winning, when you’re playing against your biggest rivals the pressure is much bigger.”",

Sunday 15 December 2024 22:24, UK Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Pep Guardiola said he is ""not good enough"" to solve Manchester City's mounting problems after two late Manchester United goals consigned them to a dramatic 2-1 derby loss. City unravelled in spectacular fashion at the Etihad Stadium as Amad Diallo struck a 90th-minute winner for the visitors just moments after Bruno Fernandes had levelled from the penalty spot. The game-changing penalty was conceded by makeshift left-back Matheus Nunes after his poor back-pass put Ederson in trouble, but Guardiola took responsibility as he reflected on an unprecedented eighth defeat in 11 games afterwards. ""I'm the boss, I'm the manager, I have to find solutions but I don't find solutions,"" he said in his press conference. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""This is a big club and when you lose eight [out of 11 games] something is wrong. You can say the schedule is tough or the injuries to players, but no. ""I'm the manager and I'm not good enough, simple as that. I have to find a way to talk to them, to train them in the way we need to play, to press the way we need to press. ""I'm not good enough. I'm not doing well. That is the truth.""

             Guardiola signed a new two-year contract in November, saying he did not feel he could leave the club at a difficult time, but the crisis has spiralled since then and he is now facing questions over how and when he can reverse their fortunes. ""I'm here,"" he said. ""I'm responsible. It would be easy for me to say we lost because of this action or this player or this situation but football is a team game. ""I'm completely convinced in what I'm saying, that I'm not good enough to find a way for them to feel peace in their bodies and their minds. I want it desperately. I'm here to try and I will try again and again but that is the reality."" Guardiola added: ""I knew it would be a tough season but I didn't expect so hard."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Speaking to Sky Sports, Guardiola said: ""This year, I would say many times this has unfortunately happened. We give away many things against Feyenoord and in games this season and at this level, it's more difficult. ""We are not, I would say, nice in the way we play. Before it was so fluid and now we struggle for different reasons - of course for a lot of defeats - but we put everything in, the game was almost closed except one chance for Bruno Fernandes. ""OK, they were a little better, more possession in the first half, but nothing special. But at the end, we give away the two goals and it's more difficult."" ""It is what it is, what can I say? It is not about this action of a player, or that, it is a tough season and it will be a tough season. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""We did not play at our best today because in some positions we are not at our best, we struggled, but it is what it is. ""Now we do not play for many things, but especially for the momentum that we have. ""We obviously need results to lift our mood, but it is getting worse and worse and the reality is it is like this. I am the manager of this club and I have to find a solution. And so far, I did not find it. This is the truth."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Manchester City midfielder Bernardo Silva pulled no punches on their performance in the closing stages, slamming their ""stupid mistakes"" and insisting they got what they deserved. ""At this level, if it's a game or two, you can say that they are being lucky,"" he told Sky Sports. ""If it's 10 games, it's not about that. ""If in the 87th minute of a derby, you are winning 1-0 with a corner for your team and the ball ends up with your 'keeper and a penalty for them, my friend… ""If you make these kinds of stupid decisions with three or four minutes to go, you deserve to pay for that. ""If you look at the game, there was only one team that could win. But in the end, we lost, and it's not one game, it's a lot of games lately. ""We have to look at ourselves. It's not about luck. It's the decisions you make. Today, in the last minutes we played like Under-15s and we paid the price."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Speaking on the Gary Neville Podcast, Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville said Guardiola is facing a rebuild and that some of his players have reached the end of the road at the club. ""This is not a time for anybody with knowledge of the game to stick the knife into Manchester City or Pep Guardiola. This is a time to recognise that these players have run a million miles together over many, many years, and they've just hit a wall. ""They've hit a wall with their manager all at once. It happened at United in a number of seasons over a 20-year period where we didn't win for one or two seasons. Pep Guardiola's only ever had one season without the title. This may be another one here. ""These are serial winners and this is one of the greatest managers of all time. They've played unbelievably consistently, been reliable, everything you'd want in a football team, and these players have delivered. They will always be winners. ""But they've all come to a point in their journey together whereby something needs to change, and they need a rest. I thought it would come last year. I thought after the treble there would be a dip. Not a dip in their will to win, you just cannot keep going. ""You need to somehow have a break. They're playing in Champions League games, they're playing in FA Cup finals, Carabao Cup finals, winning leagues. They've played for their countries every summer and they've just come to the end of that journey as a group. ""One or two of them may have to leave, three or four will have to come in, and you'll see a different Manchester City through those changes. It's not a massive rebuild, it's just getting the players fit, and getting that sort of adaptation to the squad. ""This is a time to say well done for what you've achieved over the last few years, because this is not them. They've proven that to us over a period of four, five, six seasons.""

 Sunday 15 December 2024 21:55, UK Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Manchester United staged a stunning comeback at the Etihad Stadium as Amad Diallo's last-minute goal clinched a 2-1 win over crisis-hit Manchester City. Ruben Amorim's side were trailing to Josko Gvardiol's first-half header until the 88th minute, when a tepid derby exploded into life as Matheus Nunes fouled Amad, following a poor backpass, to concede a penalty which was converted by Bruno Fernandes. Moments later, the excellent Amad was put through on goal from Lisandro Martinez's ball over the top, touching it around Ederson before steering a superb finish into the net from an acute angle to leave the home supporters in stunned silence. Man City: Ederson (6), Dias (5), Walker (5), Gvardiol (7), Nunes (4), Silva (6), De Bruyne (6), Gundogan (6), Foden (7), Doku (6), Haaland (5).

Player of the Match: Amad Diallo
 The result deepens the crisis facing Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola, whose side have only won one of their last 11 games in all competitions, continuing the club's worst run of form since 2006. For Manchester United, the victory, only their second in the Premier League under Amorim, came after two huge calls by the new boss, who left forwards Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho out of his squad, citing selection reasons. Asked about Ruben Amorim's omissions of Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho ahead of the game, Sky Sports pundit Roy Keane said: ""He has obviously seen something he doesn't like.


""But for those who have watched Manchester United recently, it's not a big surprise because both players have been poor.


""He has said 'enough is enough'. It's a big call, but I like to see it. He has put down a marker."" 


Speaking before the game, Amorim revealed Rashford and Garnacho were made to train on Sunday morning. Their absences saw Amad pushed into a more advanced role and he duly punished the out-of-sorts hosts for failing to add to Gvardiol's opener, which was headed home from Kevin De Bruyne's deflected cross from one of few chances in the first half. It appeared Guardiola's side were going to stumble over the line to victory when Fernandes dinked a one-on-one chance wide after Amad had seen a flicked header pushed around the post by Ederson in the second period, but City's latest implosion allowed United to celebrate a remarkable victory.

             The champions are left in fifth place, behind Nottingham Forest in fourth, and nine points off leaders Liverpool, who have a game in hand.

""Our conversation would be so different without the two goals but the performance would be the same. ""I think the players did a very good job. They were in the game for 90 minutes and that is really important. I think we deserved this win. It was a good day for us. ""You could feel we were near to scoring. We improved our speed when we made more runs. We controlled [Erling] Haaland and the other guys in City's offense very well.

On Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho, Amorim added: ""It was nothing special. New week, new life. If they train well, they will compete for a place in the team, if they are better than the other guys in all the situations, inside and outside the pitch. ""They are really talented and we need Garna and Rash a lot. It was not a disciplinary thing. It's just that we have to improve our standards. They will get used to this."" A distraught Mason Mount suffered another injury setback as he limped off after only 12 minutes at the Etihad Stadium.


Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim told Sky Sports: ""He stretched his leg and felt something. It was bad luck. We are going to recover him because we need him.


""He really fits our style because he’s a very good player. Also, outside the pitch he is the kind of character I want in this team."" Bruno Fernandes hailed Manchester United match-winner Amad Diallo, telling Sky Sports: ""He has been doing great things and there's a lot more to come. ""He's always active, always alive and this is why he gets the penalty and his goal. He's been brilliant but I shouldn't say much as we need to keep him going as we need him at this level. ""Like this, he is unstoppable. ""I'm pretty sure he can do this every week. We expect it. He knows the expectation when playing for Manchester United. He's getting his chance deservedly.

Hojlund took to social media to taunt Walker aftewards, writing on Instagram: ""Manchester is red, violets are blue, what a brilliant performance, but the Oscar goes to..."" Bernardo Silva did not hold back on Manchester City's collapse, telling Sky Sports: ""We totally deserved what happened. ""At this level, if it's a game or two, you can say that they are being lucky. If it's 10 games, it's not about that. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""If in the 87th minute of a derby, you are winning 1-0 with a corner for your team and the ball ends up with your 'keeper and a penalty for them, my friend… ""If you make these kinds of stupid decisions with three or four minutes to go, you deserve to pay for that. ""If you look at the game, there was only one team that could win. But in the end, we lost, and it's not one game, it's a lot of games lately. ""We have to look at ourselves. It's not about luck. It's the decisions you make. Today, in the last minutes we played like under-15s and we paid the price."" Man City boss Pep Guardiola told Sky Sports: ""This year it happens many times unfortunately. We gave away many things. We are not nice in the way we played. Before it was so fluid, now we're struggling for different reasons. A lot of defeats. ""We put everything in and the game was almost closed. They had more possession first half but nothing special. We give away two goals, very difficult. ""It is what it is. What can I say? We can not blame this player or that one, it's not that. It's the season, a tough season. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""We didn't play our best. We are not our best and we struggle a bit. Now we don't play for the week. ""Previously we didn't lose that many in two seasons. Now we've done it in eight games. You have to defend. We have lost a lot of games. It's difficult. We have to move on and try to find the solution and try to win games. ""I think in nine years it wasn't the toughest defeat. Champions League defeats were harder. But at the moment, we need results to lift our mood. It's getting worse and worse. I have to find the solution. So far I didn't find it and this is the truth.""

The main news is that Joey Veerman and Jerdy Schouten will both board the plane. Schouten was reportedly ready for his comeback for PSV against Twente on Friday, yet didn’t make an appearance as Peter Bosz used up his substitutions at an early stage.  While Veerman appeared for the second half in the 6-1 thrashing of the Tukkers, the Volendammer had already turned out against Utrecht a week earlier. PSV have no suspensions, although three of their players were booked against Shakhtar – they were their first cautions of the European campaign. If he appears, it should be the final Champions League game for Hirving Lozano in PSV colours. He will leave for America and the newly formed San Diego FC during the winter break. PSV selection: Walter Benitez, Joël Drommel, Niek Schiks, Ryan Flamingo, Mauro Júnior, Olivier Boscagli, Rick Karsdorp, Matteo Dams, Fredrik Oppegård, Armando Obispo, Malik Tillman, Guus Til, Joey Veerman, Jerdy Schouten, Ismael Saibari, Richard Ledezma, Johan Bakayoko, Luuk de Jong, Noa Lang, Hirving Lozano and Ricardo Pepi.

Sem Steijn struck the first blow for the Tukkers with a superb free-kick goal just 10 minutes in, but once the Eindhoven engine was running, the team from Enschede were simply pulverized. 56 – @PSV scored 56 goals this @eredivisie campaign, the highest tally for any side after 15 matches since PSV themselves in 1987-88 (64). Overpowering. pic.twitter.com/V2VrxxbsdB As said, Twente opened the scoring, however, the hosts took just 10 minutes to react. Cutting in from the left, Noa Lang beat Michal Sadílek well before placing an effort past low and hard past Lars Unnerstall’s stand-in, Przemysław Tytoń.  On 34′, the hosts truly shifted the momentum as Malik Tillman emerged from a scrappy box to fire in a right-sided cross low off the right post. Ismael Saibari then aptly capped a flowing team move two minutes into stoppage time. Despite the interval arriving mercifully, Twente just couldn’t regroup and Saibari resumed the scoring on 54′ – firing into the bottom-left corner with aplomb after being played in by Ricardo Pepi. The latter’s USMNT colleague Richard Ledesma then made it 5-1 with a fine strike from a tough angle on the right, before Pepi himself rounded off a fine day with a stylish chip five minutes from time. ""Wat een beauty"" 😍#psvtwe PSV currently sit a-top of the Eredivisie handsomely with 14 games won out of a possible 15, forty-two points acquired and fifty-six goals scored. They are nine points clear of the chasing pack leaders Ajax in second. After they face Brest away from home in the UEFA Champions League, a visit to SC Heerenveen awaits, before the year-ending match is in a little over two weeks at home against Feyenoord. Twente remains in fifth place. Joseph Oosting’s troops play at Olympiakos on Thursday and welcome FC Groningen on Sunday. GBeNeFN | Max Bradfield  @2023 - All Rights Reserved. Get Football Group",

The attacking midfielder indicated last weekend that the ‘holy fire’ is lacking in him, which was fodder for various interpretations from opinionated pundits. These include Pierre van Hooijdonk, who noted that perhaps the midfielder should be sent away on holiday for two weeks. Opposing the outside influence, and noting the potential for things to spiral, Bosz quipped at his press conference: “On the one hand, I understand that there is speculation because he started it himself and could not get the time to explain it properly. On the other hand, I thought it was very dangerous what Pierre van Hooijdonk did, for example.” In other news, the Eindhoven coach also addressed the fitness of a couple of contentious faces in Joey Veerman and Jerdy Schouten ahead of the Friday night clash with FC Twente. Bosz provided an insight into the duo’s recovery process. “We have to continue building with Joey. I will have a chat with Jerdy and the medical staff (to see his progress).” GBeNeFN | Max Bradfield  @2023 - All Rights Reserved. Get Football Group",

On Thursday, Twente head coach Joseph Oosting revealed that three pivotal players are doubts for the big game. Lars Unnerstall, Ricky van Wolfswinkel and Anass Salah-Eddine are all unlikely to travel to the Philips Stadion. The club are set to make late fitness calls on the trio. After revealing the injury news, Oosting went on to deliver his pre-match thoughts. ‘A nice challenge awaits against a very good team. We will see if against a top team like PSV we can continue the line against Go Ahead Eagles, especially how we started in the first few minutes.’ ‘If we play with guts when in possession, we have a team that can get something against anyone.

His hat trick in last Saturday’s 5-0 thumping of FC Groningen made him the joint-top scorer in the Eredivisie for the 2024/25 season, highlighting his efficiency in front of goal. The 21-year-old is averaging a goal every 56 minutes. And yet it’s still not certain that he is PSV’s first-choice centre forward. Luuk de Jong has started all five of the club’s Champions League matches this season with the 34-year-old also starting nine league games compared to Pepi’s four. Despite the American’s incredible form, Bosz continues to rotate. “Ricardo [Pepi] did a great job, and it’s great to have two players of such high quality for this position,” said Bosz after Pepi’s impressive hat trick against FC Groningen in the Eredivisie. “But there’s no need to bring Luuk [de Jong] into question every time Pepi scores. Both are crucial for us, and who plays is my decision.”   The two strikers are very different. While de Jong is a quintessential frontman, giving PSV aerial threat and a focal point to play into and hold up the ball, Pepi is a classic penalty box operator. His game revolves around taking up good positions inside the area to find the back of the net, as he has been doing regularly of late. For club and country, Pepi is in fine form. Indeed, the 21-year-old was similarly productive for the US men’s national team in the most recent international window, scoring in back-to-back CONCACAF Nations League games against Jamaica. His finish in the second leg of the quarter-final was particularly polished, guiding the ball into the far corner after cutting inside.   It was the sort of cutting edge the USMNT has lacked from its centre forwards of late. Folarin Balogun, Josh Sargent and Brandon Vazquez have all been used in the position since the 2022 World Cup with inconsistent results. Most view Balogun as the American striker with the highest ceiling, but Pepi’s goals are reshaping the discussion. While Pepi’s goalscoring displays against Jamaica might have moved him to the top of the USMNT pecking order, they also highlighted the improvements he’s still to make. As a traditional frontman, Pepi must get better at holding up play with his back to goal. He simply has to be more involved in possession phases. To make that progression, Pepi might have to leave PSV, particularly if his form still isn’t enough to dislodge de Jong from the lineup. Liverpool and Manchester City have been linked with the American while Atlético Madrid are also believed to be monitoring Pepi’s situation. Some of Europe’s biggest clubs are seemingly interested. Of course, Pepi must be wise in picking the right club for his continued development should he make the decision to leave PSV. He needs game time to build on his natural talent and he might not get that at Anfield or the Etihad Stadium. There wouldn’t be much point in Pepi swapping one bench at PSV for another one somewhere else.   PSV are currently leading the way at the top of the Eredivisie having won 12 of their 13 games played so far. The Eindhoven-based team are well-placed to retain the title they won last season when de Jong finished as the division’s joint-top scorer with an eye-catching 29 goals in 34 games. Newcastle United fans must be confused by the veteran’s continued output. This season, however, Pepi is intent on being the one to spearhead PSV’s title challenge. At only 21, the American is still learning his trade and has come a long way from his early struggles at Augsburg following a record $20m transfer from FC Dallas. There is room for him to grow further at his current club, especially if he keeps scoring at his current rate. Whether it’s at PSV or somewhere else, Pepi is clearly ready to take the next step. His potential has been clear for a long time and that is now being realised on the pitch. The road Pepi is now on could lead to another Eredivisie title, a move to one of Europe’s biggest clubs, and a starting spot for the USA at the 2026 World Cup. It’s all in front of him.

Cooper was dismissed from his role last Sunday, with the Foxes 16th in the Premier League table. They’ve moved swiftly to appoint a new head coach, and Van Nistelrooy could be announced this week. Extensive talks have reportedly been held this week with Van Nistelrooy, with the Dutchman available after leaving his assistant role at Manchester United. The former PSV Eindhoven head coach oversaw four matches as interim manager of Manchester United, winning three and drawing one of those games after Erik ten Hag’s sacking. At PSV, the former Red Devils striker guided the club to KNVB Cup glory in 2022/23. Leicester City face Brentford, West Ham and Brighton in their next three Premier League games. They’re currently on a run of five games without a win in all competitions and are on a mission to avoid relegation this season. GBeNeFN | Jonas Fielding @2023 - All Rights Reserved.

At the press conference leading up to the match, coach Peter Bosz gave a medical update. He said that Driouech will not be in the team as, “He left the training field injured and will not be there.” PSV will have to wait and see how serious the injury is. Bosz also discussed the availability of De Jong and Lang. The duo had to watch the match against FC Groningen last weekend due to injuries. “I don’t know yet whether Luuk de Jong is available. He trained partially yesterday, perhaps the entire training today. We will decide after that. The same applies to Noa as to Luuk, we will see whether he can train with us today.” Joey Veerman was another player covered by the manager, although he won’t be ready for the Shakhtar game: “(He) is training again, which is positive, but he is not in the group for tomorrow, that match comes much too early.” GBeNeFN | Max Bradfield @2023 - All Rights Reserved.

 In this exclusive interview with Sky Sports, Sergino Dest discusses his recovery from injury at PSV, life with Lionel Messi at Barcelona and his AC Milan mistake. ""My heart was still in Barcelona and I could not really focus on the next thing,"" he reveals 
          Comment and Analysis
              @ghostgoal
 Monday 11 November 2024 16:18, UK At 23, Sergino Dest has already experienced the highs and lows of football. After the dream move from Ajax to Barcelona came the ""mistake"" in Milan. He was then flying at PSV before an anterior cruciate ligament injury brought him down to earth again. ""Unfortunately, my life path went in a different direction to what it should be going,"" he tells Sky Sports. But the message from Dest is that the journey is not over. The talent remains and as he returns to full fitness, the ambitions for the future are still sky high. There is a World Cup in the United States on the horizon. ""That is going to be special."" Before that, there is work to do in Eindhoven as PSV look to retain the Eredivisie title that Dest helped to win last season. From there, the plan is to get back to the big leagues. ""Obviously, PSV is a great club, but I have a lot of ambitions and I know what I can do. I feel that my level needs to be in the top five leagues, so I am working really hard for that. I have been in a lot of beautiful places. I want to get back to these beautiful places."" In the meantime, he is working his way back and keeping busy. ""Always busy, man."" He is speaking to Sky Sports fresh from opening a football court in his home-town of Almere, just outside Amsterdam. To the children there, his success is an inspiration. ""I had been thinking about this years ago, but I think this was the right time for me to do it. It is amazing to create your own legacy, putting my own field, my own name out there in the world. And the kids here, they love it. That it is something big and I am proud of it."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  It is an impressive sight in Almere. ""It is something new around here and I want to motivate them to go outside and play."" It is not so long ago that Dest was the young boy out there honing his skills. ""Yeah, not so long ago,"" he agrees. ""But also a long time ago.""

             There it is, that sense of a career in flux. The skills that lit up those street games in Almere took him all the way to El Clasico and to a World Cup in Qatar, following his much-discussed decision to represent the United States instead of the Netherlands. Only now, given his injury, is he coming to terms with all that he won - and all that he lost. Dest achieved the dream absurdly early. Plucked from Erik ten Hag's Ajax, he found himself thrust into Barcelona's first-team alongside Lionel Messi while still a teenager. Now, he is readjusting to life back in the Eredivisie at a time when the expectation was that his career would be on the rise. He wants to go again, talks of being eager not to waste time because he can still improve. But memories of Camp Nou linger inside him. Looking back, it impacted his loan move to AC Milan. ""Milan for me was a big mistake. Obviously, it is a beautiful club but I was not ready at that time to go there, mentally. At that moment, my heart was still in Barcelona and I could not really focus on the next thing. I think that is why it went the way it went."" Dest made only 14 appearances for Milan that season after what had been a whirlwind two years at Barca. ""Everything went really fast but I enjoyed every little minute of it. Going into that dressing room, playing against Real Madrid, winning the Copa del Rey."" He can always say that he played with Messi during the legend's last ever season at Barcelona. ""I was not really thinking about it like that at the time, but that is crazy if you think about it."" Seeing Messi and Antoine Griezmann work up close was an education. ""Watching them in training and in games, you try to improve your game by learning what that they do that make them so good."" What, exactly? ""A lot of the time, it is by delaying. They see where they need to run or pass but it is different. They see the bigger picture."" He explains: ""Sometimes if you delay the play, it looks like you are going to pass it but in the last second you change your mind, adjust your body and with one touch you pass it to the other player. That is unpredictable for the opponent and so difficult to defend."" Dest has plenty of special skills of his own. Gary Neville once said that nobody grows up dreaming of being a full-back but Dest is no ordinary full-back. He is fond of getting his best bits clipped up for his social channels and takes pride in those flicks and tricks. ""Look, even with all these wingers, I can still make highlights videos - and I am a full-back! It is possible. And I enjoy it,"" he says. ""You can make every position a nice position. You just have to make it your own. I play with flair, I give it my own style. Obviously, I need to improve on certain things. I can be better. But I feel like the way I do it is about flair but it is also about being functional. ""You see, it is not that difficult for me to bypass a man. I feel like these tricks that people say are too much are okay because they are actually functional. It makes you creative. If you can create when the game is locked, your dribble can create that two vs one."" Peter Bosz, the head coach at PSV who is doing such an impressive job, understands this. ""He just loves me as a player, man. He has a lot of confidence in me, he is patient and he trusts me. That is the best thing you can have. And he pushes me to the limits."" Those kids in Almere were shocked when he chose to join PSV. ""They could not believe it!"" But Ajax were in no shape for him to return. ""It is a bit chaotic at the club and at this moment I have had enough chaotic. I need something stable and calm,"" he explains. Even so, there are fond memories of the famous old club, and words of support for Ten Hag, particularly his man-management skills after he gave Dest time off to decide his international future. ""He was very kind to me. I thought he was a really good coach."" Dest settled on the United States, where his father was born, and remains utterly convinced it was the right move for him. ""That was the best choice of my life. I will never ever regret it. I have had so many beautiful experiences and I feel important there."" It is a recurring theme of the conversation. After the rise and the feelings of rejection, there is the need to be valued. ""PSV was there in a difficult moment. They still had faith and believed in me, so that was important and I am really thankful for that,"" he says. ""It was difficult mentally because you do not want to go back to the Eredivisie if you have played for these big clubs. My mentality was that I was going to kill it and get back up again. But then, unfortunately, came the injury. It was all sunshine until the injury. ""I have an amazing season, became a champion and could not even play the last game where we became champions. It was frustrating. Since then, it has been a lot of hours in the gym to get every muscle to a strong level again. It takes time but it is going well. ""Maybe it is good for me to be stable at one club a little longer because I kept moving every year to another club. But I also do not want to waste time. I want to get the maximum out of my career."" The message from Dest is clear. He is just getting started. ""I am glad that I had this path. I made a lot of mistakes that I will not make in the future. It is just all experience, man. I accept it. I cannot change it. This is just the path I have to follow at this moment. And better things will come. I know I am going to come back."" Tom from Southampton became a millionaire for free with Super 6! Could you be the next jackpot winner? Play for free!

Ryan Flamingo got the scoring under way after 16 minutes as he turned Malik Tillman's long throw home, despite replays showing that it should have been disallowed as Tillman's foot was over the byline before releasing the ball. Tillman got himself on the scoresheet 17 minutes later with a fine finish after he arribed into the box unopposed.  Things went from bad to worth for Girona after half-time, with Arnau Martinez receiving a red card 10 minutes into the second half for a second bookable offence.

Ismael Saibari was next to put the ball in the back of the net, although his effort was ruled out for a foul in the build-up following a VAR review. Johan Bakayoko did get PSV's third with seven minutes to go, before a Ladislav Krejci own goal wrapped up the rout in the 88th minute.

Watching Spain win the UEFA Euro 2024 title may have further motivated him to get back on La Roja’s radar. Several clubs expressed interest in Soler during the summer transfer window, but it was West Ham who secured his loan move on the final day. The 27-year-old midfielder has made 13 appearances so far for a West Ham team currently struggling in 14th place in the Premier League. In October, Claret and Hugh reported that the deal is strictly a loan, with no obligation for West Ham to buy. A senior official at London Stadium confirmed, “Soler is just here on loan with absolutely no obligation for us to buy.” Given his high wages and the significant fee PSG would demand, any deal exceeding £1 million would require board approval, making a permanent transfer unlikely. Soler won’t stay at PSG, so his future is up in the air as to where he’ll play long-term. Nonetheless, for now, he’s relishing the opportunity to play in London and for a Premier League club, but his remarks do sound like someone who wants to stay with the Hammers long-term. “I want to keep gaining confidence, playing matches and minutes, which is what I like and what makes me happy,” Soler told Diario AS. “Living in a city like London is also magnificent. Paris, imagine that, Valencia, I won’t even mention… But I am very happy here, honestly.” “In the end, I came here on loan for a year to seize the opportunity. Playing in the Premier League, which may sound cliché, but it’s true, is something I’ve wanted since I was a child, and I’m enjoying it. I’m really liking it. Beyond that, I can’t tell you anything else.” Fichajes reports that Real Sociedad are already planning for the upcoming summer transfer window, with Carlos Soler emerging as a potential target. However, the La Liga club faces a major challenge. PSG have reportedly set Soler’s price at around €20 million, which exceeds Real Sociedad’s current budget. The Spanish club’s management are hoping to negotiate a lower fee, taking advantage of Soler’s limited role in PSG’s plans. Your email address will not be published.

The Red Devils were able to do without the two talented players as they had a dramatic come-from-behind 2-1 victory over Manchester City on Sunday night in the latest Manchester Derby.  Manchester United secured a dramatic win at the Etihad Stadium with two late goals, coming from behind after Josko Gvardiol’s first-half header gave Manchester City the lead.  Bruno Fernandes equalized with a penalty in the 88th minute, and Amad Diallo netted the winner in the 90th minute, rounding Éderson to seal the victory. Following the win, Amorim was, of course, asked about his decision to leave the two talented players out of the squad. “It’s important to say why: it was not a disciplinary thing,” Amorim told a postmatch news conference (h/t ESPN). “Next week, next game, new life, they are fighting for their places. “For me it’s important, the performance in training, the performance in games, the way you dress, the way you eat, the way you engage with teammates, the way you push your teammates. “Everything is important in our context in the beginning of something when we want to change a lot of things, when people in our club are losing their jobs we have to set the standards really high and for that they have to fight for a place in the team. “Today the team proved we can leave anyone out of the squad and manage to win if you play together. If it was disciplinary, I would say that here and it will be a bigger problem but was not that.” TEAMtalk reported on Sunday that Manchester United have decided to sell Marcus Rashford during the January transfer window. The report adds that PSG are admirers of the England international, and with United now open to letting him go, other potential suitors could also enter the mix. Meanwhile, Chris Wheeler of the Daily Mail suggests Manchester United might be open to offers in the region of £40 million for the forward. Your email address will not be published.

Journalists Christian Falk and Tobi Altschäffl recently reported that Bayern Munich have stopped attempting to persuade Kimmich to take a pay cut on his €20 million annual salary. The club are aware that Kimmich is attracting interest from other top clubs, and with his contract expiring next year, it’s unlikely he would agree to a salary reduction. According to The Mirror (h/t The Manchester Evening News), Guardiola is set to have a massive £200 million budget available for the January transfer window. A portion of that amount could reportedly be allocated to pursuing Bayern Munich midfielder Joshua Kimmich, whose contract with the German club is set to expire in less than seven months. Guardiola previously worked with the 29-year-old during his time at Bayern Munich, and the report suggests the Catalan manager is eager for a reunion. Your email address will not be published.

Among the players that the Ligue 1 McDonald’s leaders are connected to is Sporting Lisbon’s Viktor Gyökeres.  Foot Mercato recently reported that Luís Campos is rethinking his partnership with Luis Enrique and has shown interest in signing Gyökeres. Campos has already reached out to the striker’s representatives, although conversations with Enrique have revealed some concerns from the coach. Meanwhile, SPORT indicates that Barcelona are considering a €70 million offer for Gyökeres, which could include loaning him back to Sporting for another season. Additionally, CaughtOffside has reported that Newcastle are prepared to make a major move for Gyökeres if Alexander Isak leaves the club. However, this transfer is unlikely to happen during the January window. Gyökeres has quickly become one of the most in-demand players in world football, thanks to his remarkable goal-scoring record for Sporting Lisbon. With an impressive 69 goals in just 74 appearances, the Swedish forward has caught the eye of many.  However, Troy Deeney isn’t entirely convinced, claiming Gyökeres is “not a natural goalscorer” and wouldn’t be the difference-maker for Arsenal or Manchester United in their quest for the Premier League title. “I genuinely think he’s a good footballer, he works really hard, all of that, but I don’t think he’s a natural finisher,” Deeney said on talkSPORT (h/t The Mirror).  “And again, everyone is going to pull up his goal record, I get that. But I don’t think he takes either of those two to winning the Premier League. That’s just my opinion, and if he did, they’d have already bought him.” I believe the many of Premier League coaches lack the finesse and nuance to get the best out of the players who are under their coaching and tutelage.
As many players who move to other European leagues excel and have honed their skills better.
Then, Premier League’s coaches covet them and try to bring them back at much inflated transfer fees.
One such player is Viktor Gyokeres who is being scouted by several clubs including Manchester United and with such intense competition, the transfer fee will skyrocket for sure. Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked * Comment  Name *  Email *

Back in October, TEAMtalk reported that Paris Saint-Germain had renewed their interest in the 27-year-old. Although the obstacles that prevented a transfer last summer remain, the Ligue 1 side could revisit their pursuit next year. The outlet also noted that PSG manager Luis Enrique believes Rashford can rediscover his best form. At the same time, Chris Wheeler of the Daily Mail suggests Manchester United might be open to offers in the region of £40 million for the forward. Ahead of the game, Sky Sports pundit Roy Keane shared that being left out of the Manchester derby would be a significant setback for Marcus Rashford. “It will be a big talking point because they have been involved in all the other games,” Keane said (h/t TEAMtalk). “He’s obviously seen something he doesn’t like and he’s had a look at it, he’s a new manager. “Obviously, a couple of issues going on—the other night in Europe, when he came off, his body language on the bench,” Keane said (h/t TEAMtalk) All these little signals. Remember, you have a new manager and new staff who have come into the club. “They will be picking up on all that stuff. Clearly, he said he’s been looking at it and he’s not happy with it. He’s the manager… big call. Quality is not enough; we have discussed this many times. “Quality in terms of picking moments in the game—which he’s not even been great at recently. It might be an end to him. Let’s not be writing him off; he’s just been left out of this squad, but it doesn’t look good for him. “I think, ultimately, there’s been talk over the last few months. I feel probably a move for Marcus definitely would suit the player—a new challenge for him. “He’s been at the club a long time, he’s done well for the club, but over the last year or two, at a big club, if your attitude is not quite right—and his certainly hasn’t been great recently—sometimes I think it is good to part ways.” TEAMtalk reported on Sunday that Manchester United have decided to sell Marcus Rashford during the January transfer window. The report adds that PSG are admirers of the England international, and with United now open to letting him go, other potential suitors could also enter the mix.

Moreover, on Sunday, the Frenchman received another sign that he’s not wanted by manager Luis Enrique. For the match against Olympique Lyonnais, the forward was left out of the squad.  Kolo Muani has faced challenges in securing a starting role as PSG’s main striker, playing only 453 minutes across all competitions. This has sparked speculation about a possible move in January. Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has indicated that Kolo Muani could leave PSG if the club receives an attractive offer. However, there is currently no concrete link to Manchester United, with no talks or negotiations taking place. Meanwhile, CaughtOffside reported that Arsenal are keeping an eye on several attacking targets, including Kolo Muani, Alexander Isak, Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo, Mateo Retegui, and Liam Delap.

One player drawing a lot of interest is Palmeiras’ rising star, Vitor Reis.  In October, Football Insider reported that Liverpool have joined the race to sign Palmeiras’ promising young defender, Vitor Reis, as part of their efforts to strengthen their central defense. The report also noted that Reis is eager to move to Europe and fulfill his dream of playing in the Champions League. However, Palmeiras appears determined to keep him for the time being. ESPN Brazil added that Manchester United, Arsenal, and Paris Saint-Germain are also keeping an eye on Reis. With the defender under contract until December 2028 and a €100 million release clause, a transfer doesn’t seem likely anytime soon. According to GOAL Brasil, Real Madrid, Arsenal, Chelsea, and Inter Milan have recently contacted Reis. The report also suggests that Real Madrid have had the longest-standing interest in the defender. 🚨 Real Madrid, Arsenal, Chelsea, and Inter Milan have approached Vitor Reis in recent days.

Additionally, he has a contract until 2028 and a release clause of €100 million, which no club is willing to pay at the moment. Inter Milan are keen on signing Reis, but his hefty price tag could be a major obstacle. As reported by Italian outlet FCInterNews, the 18-year-old is expected to cost a minimum of €40 million.

Brighton are reportedly asking for nearly £100 million to sell the forward, but they have no plans to let him go anytime soon. Pedro is under contract until 2028, giving Brighton significant leverage in any potential negotiations. This season, the Brazilian has made ten appearances, scoring four goals and providing three assists. CaughtOffside reported on Sunday, citing sources, that Liverpool and Arsenal are both preparing offers in the range of €55 million to €65 million for Pedro, with Manchester City also planning a move for the young striker.  Pep Guardiola and Mikel Arteta are among those who believe he could enhance their attacking options. Brighton have set a price tag of around €70 million (about £60 million) for Pedro, and it remains to be seen whether his suitors are willing to meet that asking price.  The report claims that Pedro is open to leaving Brighton for a club that can offer him Champions League football. Your email address will not be published.

The same outlet recently noted that PSG manager Luis Enrique is confident Rashford can rediscover his best form.  Meanwhile, Chris Wheeler from the Daily Mail reports that Manchester United might be willing to accept around £40 million for the forward. Before the news of Rashford’s benching, former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson weighed in on the 27-year-old’s future at Old Trafford, as rumors of a potential departure in 2025 remain ongoing.  The Telegraph reports that Ferguson would have loved the opportunity to work with the forward and is “convinced” he’s still the best player at the club. The former manager believes Rashford’s talents “need to be harnessed for the betterment of the team.”  However, he also acknowledges that the frequent changes in management have “prevented the forward from getting the best out of himself.” Rashford has not found the form from the 2022-23 season, which saw him 30 goals in 56 appearances across all competitions. It feels like a change of scenery could help the 27-year-old find the form again. Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked * Comment  Name *  Email *

It feels like there might be because—when was the last time we saw Marcus Reisford smile? When did you see him smile? You never, ever see him smile.  “When the transfer window comes round, buying players, if you’ve got enough money, is easy. Selling players on big money is tough.

It feels there’s something we don’t know about.” Rashford’s future at Manchester United seems uncertain, with Barcelona reportedly showing interest in signing the forward. According to Fichajes, the Catalan club are exploring the possibility of bringing Rashford on board. Meanwhile, the Red Devils are said to be open to a sale and have reportedly set his price at £40 million. Sell Rashford in January if possible.  He’s a passenger on our team and should have been sold last summer. We need players who are willing to run their heart out for this club and not anyone who wants to hang around sulking. He.is not going to improve here, he has to move on. Dido. I said the same. Rashford only plays good soccer with high playing teams. Balls behind defense and he runs at it. 1 on 1 Rashford is useless.

Five VfB goals - all of the highest quality - helped the Swabians bounce back from a 1-5 defeat in Belgrade and remain within striking distance of the UCL playoffs with two group stage match days remaining. Fabian Rieder collected a hat trick of assists in the win. German internationals Angelo Stiller, Josha Vagnoman, and Chris Führich scored their very first Champions' League goals. Yannik Keitel contributed an inspired performance off the bench. The 2023/24 Bundesliga runners up celebrated their first home UCL win in 15 years at the MHP Arena.  Hoeneß lined his team up in the manner expected. Both teams donned black armbands in solidarity with Bern's Meschak Elia. The Congo DR international's son passed away yesterday. After a moment-of-silence to observe the loss, the Swiss guests got off to a surprisingly strong start against the heavily favored hosts. Five minutes had barely been played when the capital city side took a shock lead.  After a nice one-two with Alan Virginius, Polish youth international Lukasz Lakomy fired an unstoppable laser past a helpless Alexander Nübel from about 20 meters out. There was an emotional scene after the 6th-minute 1-0 as Lakomy and his teammates held up Elia's tricot in front of the broadcast cameras. The YBB XI then immediately fell back in defense of their lead.  Stuttgart could only manage narrow pinpricks through the predicable Demirovic channel in response. The VfB lead striker popped an effort over the bar on his best opportunity in the 22nd. Three minutes later, some more courageous play from Stiller enabled the hosts to net the equalizer. The German international charged forward, picked up Vagnoman in the box, and continued his run to finish off Vagnoman's return ball.  Stiller's inaugural Champions' League goal helped the Swabians play with much more comfort and confidence over the course of the rest of the opening 45. A major chance at a second goal nevertheless didn't materialize before it was time to head into the tunnel. The hosts came out blazing after the restart, however, with Demirovic nearly netting the 2-1 just seconds after kickoff.  A controversial scene in the 53rd enabled Stuttgart to take the lead. Fabian Rieder appeared to let the ball cross the byline after stripping Joel Monteiro in the box. The linesman's flag caused several Bernese players to stop even as Reider kept playing and serviced Millot on the 2-0. A VAR review confirmed that the ball did not go out into touch. Hence, the goal counted.  Führich scored the 3-1 in the 61st with a brilliant distance effort every bit as equal to that of Lakomy's opener. Rieder collected his second assist of the night after setting Führich up off of what was a neat set-piece design put together by Hoeneß and staff. Führich then played a vital role in the 66th 4-1. A strong ball win from Führich began a sequence that ended with Vagnoman polishing off a Millot cross. Some nine minutes later, it was substitute Keitel's turn. The summer signing has barely featured at all for his new club due to the competitive situation in midfield. On for captain Atakan Karazor at the half, the 24-year-old contributed a very strong performance and was also involved in Vagnoman's goal. Keitel rolled home the 5-1 beautifully into the corner from outside the 18 central.  ",

Back home in the cozy confines of the MHP-Arena, Sebastian Hoeneß' Swabian's will also be hoping to give their home supporters something to cheer about following some now famous incidents in which they were forced to endure humiliation en-route to the last match. Hoeneß makes two changes to the XI that lined up against Union Berlin in the Bundesliga last Friday night. Fabian Rieder returns to work as the right winger while Josha Vagnoman moves back into defense to take the slot of Leonidas Stergiou. Julian Chabot also starts above Anrie Chase in central defense.    Stuttgart (4-2-3-1): Nübel – Vagnoman, Rouault, Chabot, Mittelstädt – Karazor, Stiller – Rieder, Millot, Führich – Demirović Young Boys Bern (4-2-3-1): Von Ballmoos - Athekame, M.

The heavily-capped German youth international leads die Gießböcke in scoring with eight league goals this season. Lemperle has also pocketed four league assists and scored once in the Pokal.  The heavily-capped German youth international signed his current working papers in the summer of 2023 before being loaned out to SpVgg Greuther Fürth last season. He excelled for the Middle Franconian Kleeblätter during the 2023/24 campaign, scoring six league goals and adding six assists. His current estimated market worth stands at a career high €3 million.  Germany's Kicker Magazine linked struggling TSG 1899 Hoffenheim with a January swoop for Lemperle last week. Various other sources have also thrown VfB Stuttgart into the mix; a rumor now confirmed by the cathedral city's reliable ""Geißblog"" fan-site. The Kölner site does take care to note that Lemperle might yet extend his deal in the Domstadt.  Lemperle brings with him the experience of 26 total top flight appearances. He netted two Bundesliga goals whilst working with the Köln first team during the 2021/22 campaign, including what proved to be the winning tally in a 2-1 victory over Bochum on match-day three. The 22-year-old may opt to remain with the Effzeh as - just two points off top spot - promotion back to the top flight remains a possibility for his club.  ",

German footballing journalist George Moissidis - the VfB correspondent for Kicker Magazine - links the Swabians with Nürnberg rising star Stefanos Tzimas.  The 18-year-old Greek youth international is currently serving on loan at 1. FCN from parent club PAOK Thessaloniki. He's been immensely successful during his short stint in German football, scoring seven goals and registering one assist in 12 2. Bundesliga appearances. A new loan arrangement with PAOK could be arranged. Nürnberg could also purchase Tzimas outright and quickly ""flip"" him to the top tier side.  ",

It's a very important game for us.” VfB have only collected four points from their five matches since the clubs return to the competition, and a 5-1 defeat at the hands of Red Star Belgrade did nothing to help die Schwaben in regards to potential further qualification. Regardless, this remains the aim for Hoeneß and his side.  “We obviously want to play those two additional matches and stay in the competition,” remarked the 42-year-old, who continued on to discuss opponents Young Boys, who have been a dominant force in Switzerland in recent years, securing six of the last seven league titles across the border. “They are facing a few challenges in the league this season, but that doesn't change their general approach. They play direct and get the ball forward quickly, and they are very active without the ball, too.” Hoeneß also touched upon the energy levels of his side, with Stuttgart going through an inconsistent period throughout the first half of the 24/25 campaign, saying, ""We need to combine good positioning with the corresponding energy levels. On home soil at the MHPArena, VfB will be eager to pile the pressure on their opponents from Bern, with the visitors conceding 36 goals thus far in the Champions League this season.  Hoeneß now has Ameen Al-Dakhil ready for selection once again, with the defender being part of the matchday squad for tonight's encounter. Jamie Leweling, El Bilal Toure, Deniz Undav and Dan-Axel Zagadou all remain sidelined through injury, something rather synonymous with Stuttgart's season thus far as the club grapples with an intensified schedule.",

According to the report, Struth is expected to seek a substantial salary increase for his new client, with Stiller currently earning ""just"" €2 million a year at Stuttgart. Given the interest in Stiller from other clubs, the 23-year-old Germany international should be in a strong negotiating position. Barcelona are believed to be very keen on Stiller, who has also been linked with Premier League clubs. A return to Bayern, where he came through the youth ranks, is not on the cards, according to the report. Stuttgart would prefer to keep Stiller, but a bid in the region of €40 million could force them to consider selling the central midfielder. Stiller is tied to the club until 2027.",

However, Guirassy insists that he was never approached by the Bavarians. ""I personally haven't received a phone call, but I've also heard that there was interest,"" Guirassy told Sport Bild. “I've never had an offer from Bayern Munich, so the question doesn't even arise. I realized early on that I wanted to play for BVB,” he said of his decision to sign for Dortmund rather than Bayern. Asked about reported interest from Chelsea and Arsenal, Guirassy replied: “I like Germany, I like the Bundesliga. It's been the best stage for me in the last two years. BVB is an extremely exciting project, a fantastic club. I felt very comfortable at VfB, but everything is bigger and more exciting here. The coach also played a big part in my decision to join BVB.”",

""I decided to go on loan to a club that suits me and my style of play, and where I have the feeling that they want to keep me for the long term,"" said Rieder. Stuttgart are understood to have a purchase option in the region of €10 million on Rieder, who knows it's up to him to prove to the Swabians that he's worth the investment. ""At the end of the day, it's also up to me to push myself to make it happen. The goal is to stay in the Bundesliga and stay with Stuttgart.

Millot is available for just €18-20 million this summer due to a release clause. However, Dortmund are likely to face stiff competition for his signature, with Bayer Leverkusen and Paris Saint-Germain also thought to be interested. Given the interest in Millot and his low release clause, Stuttgart are aware that he is likely to leave the club this summer. It makes sense, therefore, to look at possible replacements and, according to Sky Germany, the Swabians see Paul Wanner as a candidate. Whether they will be able to sign the 18-year-old, who is currently on loan at Heidenheim, is doubtful, however, as Bayern Munich have made it clear that they see Wanner as a player for the future.",

That defeat has left Sebastian Hoeness' men with just four points from five games, so a win would be very welcome as they host Young Boys at the MHPArena on Wednesday. The Swabians haven't lost since their defeat in Belgrade, and most recently staged a spirited comeback against Union Berlin to turn a 2-0 deficit into a 3-2 win, with substitute Nick Woltemade netting a brace. Unfortunately for Stuttgart, Woltemade isn't eligible for the Champions League, and neither is young striker Justin Diehl or defender Ramon Hendriks, adding to the pressure on an injury-hit squad. Strikers El Bilal Touré and Deniz Undav are definitely out, as are Dan-Axel Zagadou and Luca Raimund, but winger Jamie Leweling could be back in contention after a lengthy injury lay-off. Like Stuttgart, Young Boys suffered a painful defeat in their last Champions League game, which ended in a 6-1 loss to Atalanta. The Swiss side are bottom of the standings with zero points from five games, making Stuttgart strong favorites. Young Boys' 3-1 defeat to Sion at the weekend, which has left them ninth in the Swiss league table, doesn't make things look any better for the visitors, who will be without Chaiwa (ankle), Colley (muscular), Conte (knee), Janko (muscular) and Zoukrou (muscular).

Wehrle's words on the recent experience of the VfB ultras proved most disconcerting.  ""Smaller buses were pulled over and disproportionately checked,"" Wehrle said, ""Men and women were stripped naked due to the mere fact that they were football fans. Approximately 700 fans turned back at the border."" ""The remaining fan scene [allowed in the stadium] were detained [in the guest block] for over two hours after the full-time whistle,"" Wehrle continued, ""They were not allowed to go to the restrooms or purchase concessions.

Wind handed Wolfsburg a dramatic late comeback victory over Mainz. The last time even two substitutes scored braces occurred on match-day two of the 2016/17 campaign. Finnish striker Joel Pohjanpalo, then representing Leverkusen, managed a hat-trick of the bench in a 3-1 win over Hamburger SV while Mark Uth (then a Hoffenheim player) notched two goals in a 4-4 draw with Mainz.  The last time three players served as definitive ""Super Subs"" came on match-day 28 of the 1990/91 season when Stefan Kohn (Bochum), Lothar Sippel (Frankfurt), and Martin Driller (Dortmund) accomplished the feat.

FC Union Berlin in the Bundesliga's Friday round 13 curtain raiser. After narrowly missing out on the chance to be the hero against former club SV Werder Bremen last weekend, Woltemade came on at the half to lead Sebastian Hoeneß' Swabians past Bo Svensson's 1. FC Union Berlin. The youngster lighting it up for club and country has delivered once again.  Hoeneß went with six changes to the team that prevailed over Regensburg in the cup. Alexander Nübel returned to take the place of Fabian Bredlow in goal. Fullbacks Pascal Stenzel and Ramon Hendriks made way for Maximilian Mittelstädt and Leonidas Stergiou. Regulars Atakan Karazor, Josha Vagnoman, and Ermedin Demirovic also returned to reprise their roles over Yannik Keitel, Fabian Rieder, and Woltemade. Svensson made three changes to the squad that narrowly lost to Leverkusen in the league last weekend. Diogo Leite made his comeback from injury, replacing Kevin Vogt in defense. Andras Schäfer took over for Aljosha Kemlein in midfield while Robert Skov slotted in for Christopher Trimmel at right wingback. Union maintained their 3-4-3 shape.  An uneventful opening half-hour produced little beyond a wide shot from Demirovic, who was likely offside anyway, in the 22nd. Svensson's Köpenickers sat deep and remained compact, frustrating most every attempt by the Swabians to move forward. Union then surprisingly took the lead in the 37th on a Nübel gaffe. Stuttgart fell asleep off a throw in. Danilho Doekhi's headed of a Schäfer cross wasn't particularly well placed. Nübel attempted to catch a ball he likely should have punched away. The ball slipped through the VfB net-minder's fingers and caromed in off the crossbar. An attempted clearance from Anthony Rouault came too late. Rattled, Nübel punched away a Tim Skarke effort he might have caught three minutes later. Hoeneß opted for a radical change at the break, introducing Woltemade for Stergiou and re-formatting to a 4-4-2. At first, it appeared as if this would yield nothing. Union increased their lead in the 48th when a Skov cross wandered past the disorganized VfB ranks and into the back of the net.  Woltemade nevertheless would not let the 0-2 deficit stand. The youngster pulled a goal back in the 51st, latching onto a Demirovic pass and rounding Rønnow confidently before slotting home the 1-2. The tenacious 22-year-old nearly set up Chris Führich for the equalizer five minutes later. Three minutes after that, it would be Woltemade himself who netted the equalizer. Once again, Woltemade demonstrated remarkable calm in front of goal. After drawing Rønnow out with a pair of immaculate touches, the Germany U21 international flatly finished off the 2-2 in the 59th. Woltemade nearly achieved the spectacular by rounding Rønnow on the right yet again in the 66th, but couldn't finish off the hat trick from an acute angle. Rønnow's evening turned into a right nightmare when he gifted the hosts the lead in the 69th. Karazor took advantage of a botched clearance sent directly at him from only ten meters out. The Stuttgart captain easily powered in the 3-2. The Berliners didn't go down without a fight and indeed themselves nearly equalized when subbed-on FCU striker Jordan struck the crossbar in the 71st. By the final ten minutes, however, Svensson's side simply ran out of steam. A medical emergency in the stands quieted the crowd and not much happened on the pitch either.

Die Schwaben have proven tough to beat in their recent league outings have lost just one of their previous five Bundesliga matches (W2, D2). They kicked off that run of results with a 2-1 win over Holstein Kiel, before they held champions Bayer Leverkusen to a goalless draw at the BayArena.  After going on to lose to Eintracht Frankfurt, die Schwaben bounced back to record a 2-0 victory in their home meeting against struggling Bochum. They then showed great character to come from behind on two occasions in last Saturday’s 2-2 draw against Werder Bremen, which came courtesy of an Ermedin Demirović brace.  Sebastian Hoeneß’s side dispatched Jahn Regenburg via a 3-0 scoreline in the DFB-Pokal in midweek, ensuring they will head into Friday’s contest in a positive mood. The hosts can take confidence from the fact they have won three of their previous five home matches in the Bundesliga. They have also won each of their last three competitive meetings with Union, including a 2-0 win when the two sides faced off at the MHPArena in March. Hoeneß has confirmed that Jamie Leweling remains unavailable for Friday’s fixture. The Stuttgart boss is also without the services of Dan-Axel Zagadou, Nikolas Nartey, Luca Raimund, Ameen Al-Dakhil, Deniz Undav and El Bilal Touré. Union have drawn two and lost four of their last six competitive matches since beating Holstein Keil on October 20. They began that poor run of form with a satisfactory draw against Frankfurt, before they fell to away defeats against Arminia Bielefeld and Bayern Munich in the cup and league respectively. After playing out a goalless affair with Freiburg, Union went on to lose consecutive matches against Wolfsburg and Leverkusen. Jeong Woo-yeong cancelled out Jeremie Frimpong’s opener against Leverkusen, only for Patrik Schick to net a 71st-minute winner to condemn Union to a 2-1 defeat, leaving them in 11th place in the Bundesliga table. After losing at the Stadion An der Alten Försterei, Union will now head on their travels for Friday’s tricky fixture. The visitors have struggled on the road this season, having won one, drawn two and lost three of their six away league matches. They have also lost their last two away games against Stuttgart since they recorded a 1-0 away win in October 2022. The visitors are without the injured trio of Yannic Stein, Andrej Ilić and Oluwaseun Ogbemudia, while Kevin Volland will miss Friday’s away trip through illness",

The victory will come as a welcome relief for the 42-year-old head coach who has found wins difficult to come by during the course of November. It must be said, injuries have not been kind to last season's Bundesliga runners-up.  Tonight however, Stuttgart displayed their intent as early as the 7th-minute as Führich picked out Stenzel whose header was parried by Gerhardt. The host's futile resistance lasted mere minutes longer as Enzo Millot weaved inside Bittroff and Breunig to pick out the lower right corner from the edge of the box. Anrie Chase made it 2-0 after a delightful Stenzel set-piece found the Japanese centre-half unmarked at the back post.  There proved to be no let up from the visitors after the interval as the Swabian club continued to where they left off. Chris Führich went close to wrapping one inside the post before he was withdrawn for Justin Diehl and Demirović replaced Millot. The 20-year-old youngster who arrived from FC Köln in summer played a crucial role in the third goal after the hour - his pass bisected the Regensburg defence as Woltemade rounded Gerhardt to slot into an empty net. It would be scant consolation in the end, but the post came to spare Regensburg as Ermedin Demirović looked to add a fourth. Striking across his body from a difficult angle, the Bosnian forward watched his effort bobble off the aluminium and way to safety. Nonetheless, Stuttgart were more than home and hosed at this stage as Hoeneß' team saw out the final few acts to advance to the quarter-final stage. ",

The internal competition is very strong and being able to choose between two players means that the players are 100% motivated."" Austrian side Sturm Graz are third-bottom of the entire table, having lost all four matches But despite their poor run, Michel is not willing to underestimate his opposition and suggested that he did not even consider his team as favourites. ""We will try to show our idea of the game. I tried that in Paris, against PSV and at home. The word ‘favourite’ means nothing positive or negative to me at the start of matches,"" he said. ""I have to prepare for a match and there are tactical tools in defence and attack to be able to overcome the opposition. They haven't won, but you have to look at every game. ""They are a very competitive opponent and there is a lot of difficulty in one game. I see that we are capable of imposing our game style and if we do that we will be able to achieve a positive result.""

""[Liverpool had] hardly any control at all over the game, maybe the second half was a bit better, but I'm trying to be positive."" Defender Andy Robertson accepted he and his team-mates fell below their best levels, although he preferred to focus on the result, which puts Liverpool on the brink of qualification.

""But at this point, it's about winning the games and securing qualification, and I think we've done that."" Arne Slot was ""far from pleased"" with his Liverpool side even as they continued their winning start to the Champions League season at Girona. League phase leaders Liverpool have six wins from six matches after defeating Girona 1-0 on Tuesday, although they relied on a second-half Mohamed Salah to take all three points. And with returning goalkeeper Alisson kept busy in the first half, Slot did not hide his disappointment with the Reds' display. ""If you ask me about all the six games, I'm really pleased with all the results,"" said the new Liverpool boss. ""I'm really pleased with the [first] five games the way we played; I'm far from pleased about the performance tonight."" Asked to identify exactly what he was unhappy with, Slot replied: ""A lot. Especially two things. ""If you play against a team that has such a good idea about football, knows how to bring the ball out from the back, like [Manchester] City or Real Madrid, then you need to be so intense if you want to make it difficult for them. ""But if every time you are waiting a few seconds before you press, and if you do press and you are so easily outplayed, then this team can cause you a lot of problems.

""The coach gave me confidence when I needed it, and I'm happy that I can show myself again. Just the run of games, you really need it to be honest.  ""Sometimes it's really hard.

The Reds are already into the knockout phase of the competition and this puts them in a fairly unique position for their final three group stage fixtures.  Will they look to keep momentum going in a bid to return to winning ways or will the former Feyenoord boss look at this game as an opportunity to rotate?  Girona have found it difficult in Europe.  There’s no beating around the bush. Michel’s side find themselves in 30th position (of 36) in the new-look Champions League format.  The LaLiga side have lost four of their five matches in the competition. They were expected to lose to Paris Saint-Germain but defeats against Feyenoord and Sturm Graz came as a bit of a surprise. A heavy loss to PSV Eindhoven also dented their hopes of progression while their only victory arrived against Slovan Bratislava. They have scored just four goals across their five outings and have conceded on nine occasions.   Liverpool, by comparison, have been perfect in Europe.  The Reds have 15 points from 15, they’ve scored 12 goals and have conceded just once. Inter Milan are the only team to have a better defensive record having kept clean sheets in all five of their games this term.  The Spanish side haven’t been able to replicate the heroics from last season. Girona claimed an unlikely third-place finish having amassed 81 points. Right now, they find themselves in ninth position, four points behind fifth and four points ahead of 14th.  They are winless in four and have conceded six goals across these four outings across all competitions, all while scoring just two goals.  Their home form in LaLiga hasn’t been great. They have played eight, won four and lost three this term. They’ve scored 15 and conceded 13 in these games. So no home comforts for the Blanquivermells.   Their top scorer in the league is 38-year-old Cristhian Stuani. You might remember him from his stint with Middlesborough. They also boast a former Liverpool transfer target too in Arnaut Danjuma.   Liverpool dropped points in their last outing against Newcastle United. The Magpies scored a late equaliser to halt the seven match winning run the Reds had been on. Still, Slot and his side are unbeaten since their shock defeat to Nottingham Forest in September. The Merseyside club had an unexpected break over the weekend after the Merseyside derby was postponed due to Storm Darragh. It hasn’t eased their injury crisis but the players that are fit had a bit of an extended break, so should be fit and firing.  The 2019/20 Premier League champions are still without Alisson, Ibrahima Konaté, Conor Bradley, Kostas Tsimikas and Diogo Jota. Federico Chiesa was expected to play following his return to the first-team squad after a mini pre-season but he missed training on Monday with illness. He’s now a doubt for the match while Alexis Mac Allister is suspended.  Girona are expected to be without two key players in Yangel Herrera and Viktor Tsygankov. Other than that though, Michel has a full squad to pick from.  Even if the Reds opt to go with a weaker XI, they should have enough quality at their disposal to pick up the win in Spain.

""If you skip the round and still have a difficult draw we'll think about it differently but we have to wait and see.

They have won just once in Europe so far, as opposed to Tuesday's in-form opponents Liverpool, who have a perfect record in the competition and currently sit top of the standings. Girona have never faced an English side before, but Spanish teams are winless in their last seven games against such opponents in the Champions League (D3 L4), since Real Madrid's 2-0 win over Chelsea in April 2023. ""We want to see an aggressive Girona with and without the ball,"" Michel told reporters. ""They dominate the game. I prefer to have the mentality of winning the ball back as quickly as possible. We have to look forward with and without the ball. ""It's possible that at times we'll be defending spaces, but the mentality has to be very aggressive. The crowd has to be screaming for a historic moment, for the fans to lead us to an incredible day and for the players not to get tired of running."" Liverpool are the only team with a 100% record in the Champions League this season, winning all five of their games so far. In fact, the Reds have won each of their last 10 games in the group/league phase of the competition, scoring 28 goals and only conceding three. Michel said he was fully aware of the scale of the task facing Girona. ""They dominate all the concepts of the game. Their game is very dynamic, they change structure at any moment, and they have players with top intensity and pressure,"" he added. ""If you get behind them, they are capable of winning duels... If they are in a low block, they are capable of defending the area because they are strong in the air. ""We will have to run more than ever. But it can be done, of course. They dominate everything and that's why we have to think about ourselves, be ourselves and give the best version of ourselves."" Michel, who played for Rayo Vallecano, came close to facing Liverpool when the two teams both qualified for the UEFA Cup quarter-finals in 2001. The 49-year-old said it had always been his dream to face the Anfield outfit, adding: ""It means a lot to me. ""At Rayo I always sang 'next year Rayo-Liverpool' and it was a dream. After qualifying for the Champions League, they were an opponent I wanted. Playing at Anfield or here is the same. It's a dream for everyone."" Michel has urged Girona to be more aggressive and outwork Liverpool when the two teams meet in the Champions League on Tuesday.  Girona, who finished third in LaLiga last season, are on a four-game winless streak across all competitions, and currently sit 30th in the Champions League table, three points off a play-off place after five games.

We have to look forward with and without the ball. ""It's possible that at times we'll be defending spaces, but the mentality has to be very aggressive. The crowd has to be screaming for a historic moment, for the fans to lead us to an incredible day and for the players not to get tired of running."" Liverpool are the only team with a 100% record in the Champions League this season, winning all five of their games so far. In fact, the Reds have won each of their last 10 games in the group/league phase of the competition, scoring 28 goals and only conceding three. Michel said he was fully aware of the scale of the task facing Girona. ""They dominate all the concepts of the game. Their game is very dynamic, they change structure at any moment, and they have players with top intensity and pressure,"" he added. ""If you get behind them, they are capable of winning duels... If they are in a low block, they are capable of defending the area because they are strong in the air. ""We will have to run more than ever. But it can be done, of course. They dominate everything and that's why we have to think about ourselves, be ourselves and give the best version of ourselves."" Michel, who played for Rayo Vallecano, came close to facing Liverpool when the two teams both qualified for the UEFA Cup quarter-finals in 2001. The 49-year-old said it had always been his dream to face the Anfield outfit, adding: ""It means a lot to me. ""At Rayo I always sang 'next year Rayo-Liverpool' and it was a dream. After qualifying for the Champions League, they were an opponent I wanted. Playing at Anfield or here is the same. It's a dream for everyone."" © Copyright 2024 FotMob","Girona are preparing to welcome Champions League leaders Liverpool on Tuesday, with Michel hoping for a big performance at home."

Even with a tremendous campaign in 2023/24, the side who finished third were 14 points off champions Los Blancos – and Carlo Ancelotti’s side beat them by an aggregate scoreline of 7-0 across their two league meetings. Real might be stuttering, but they have certainly had Girona’s number so far.  Look at Girona’s league form and it looks half-decent: four unbeaten, up to eighth, and only four points separating them from Villarreal in fifth. European football for next season is still very much on the cards, if they can find some consistency once more.  But, that’s the problem: they haven’t, and league fixtures aren’t the only ones they play. Girona have actually gone three without a win in all competitions following a cup shootout defeat to Logrones, a fourth-tier side. It’s two wins in six and six wins in 18, going back further. Stringing results together is tough at the top for those unused to it.   Real Madrid, meanwhile, had a very consistent start – seven victories in nine to start 2024/25 – but four defeats and three wins in their last seven paints a different recent picture. Injuries have hurt them, yes, but tactically and physically they’ve been dominated by Barcelona, Milan, Liverpool and now Athletic of late.  Yangel Herrera and Viktor Tsyhankov are the two big misses for Girona, but Yáser Asprilla is also a big miss if he doesn’t recover in time. Ladislav Krejčí is back though and should play right side of the back three. Ancelotti may juggle his pack a little but options are hampered by defensive absences, with David Alaba, Éder Militão and Dani Carvajal all sidelined for the long haul. Eduardo Camavinga and Vinícius Júnior are also out with injuries.  Real Madrid are second, four points off the top and with a game in hand – but to really pressurise Barcelona they have to start winning matches more often. With Vini Jr. out and Kylian Mbappé somewhat of a shadow of himself at present, Rodrygo must step up and show his immense worth. He averages just under a shot on target per 90 (0.9) but has created 22 chances this term in LaLiga – third in the squad behind Vinícius and Luka Modrić. That creativity plus his ball carrying – 2.1 successful dribbles per 90 is fewer than Vini’s, but his 53% success rate is notably higher – makes him Madrid’s main outlet and chief creator in the final third. Given he ranks above 93% of Europe in chance creating forwards, that must come to the fore here.   An away win would get Madrid rolling once more, though perhaps not without Girona causing some concerns across the 90 minutes. Therefore, we’ll go with Girona 1 Real Madrid 3.

Flick, however, insisted he was not surprised by his side's impressive start to the campaign despite enduring a trophyless season last term.  Barca are nine points clear at the top of LaLiga and 11th in the Champions League table ahead of facing Red Star, who are without a win from their three games so far. ""Before we came here we analysed the whole team, every player. We realised that there was very good quality overall,"" Flick said. ""Another thing to point out is that we wanted to improve how we defend and did small changes in the way we play. The players liked it and they are happy working on it. ""The players play a big role, they are helping us a lot. ""The start was already good on the pre-season in North American and the players are very happy, although there are still many things to improve."" And Barca will be confident of keeping their fine form going against a side that has lost 81% of their matches in the Champions League (P21 W2 D2 L17).  This is the first European meeting between the two sides since October 1996 in the Cup Winners’ Cup, a 1-1 draw with Giovanni cancelling out a Zoran Jovicic's opener for the Serbians. © Copyright 2024 FotMob","Barcelona have won 13 of their 15 games under Hansi Flick in all competitions, though the German played down their chances of silverware."

Juventus have posed as a lacklustre outfit for their last three matches across all competitions. Two goalless draws against Milan and Aston Villa followed up with a 1-1 stalemate with Lecce have forced manager Thiago Motta to reconsider a few things. While the absence of Dusan Vlahovic played out its part in the goalscoring department, the Bianconeri have failed to execute a smooth line of gameplay during these matches. The Old Lady are still unbeaten this season in the Serie A but eight draws have sent them to secure sixth position in the league standings. A few wins could quickly shoot them up at the top of the pile.  Meanwhile, Bologna have moved within touching range of Juventus, being just five points off their hosts for this weekend. Despite their Champions League loss to Lille last month, the Rossoblu have scored seven goals over their previous two outings. A 3-0 victory over Venezia with strikes from Dan Ndoye and Riccardo Orsolini set a formidable momentum for the side as they followed that up with a 4-0 win against Monza in the Coppa Italia midweek. Sam Beukema and Lukasz Skorupski are set to return from injuries.  Here are the predicted line-ups for the match according to Sky Italia: Juventus (4-2-3-1): Di Gregorio; Danilo, Fatti, Kalulu, Cambiaso; Locatelli, Thuram; Conceicao, Koopmeiners, Weah; Vlahovic.

Currently only a point behind seventh-placed Milan, Bologna have recovered well in the campaign after a slow start and Vincenzo Italiano’s side have shown that they are playing in the way that the new manager wants them to play. During the win over Venezia, Riccardo Orsolini was on the scoresheet and with that, he took his goalscoring tally to six and he also has two assists to his name. OptaPaolo last night took note of the Italian’s situation, stating that he is the first Serie A player to score over five goals in each season in the last seven seasons. In the top five European leagues, he is the fifth player to do it and he is behind Robert Lewandowski, Harry Kane, Kylian Mbappe and Mohamed Salah. That says a lot about the player, who scored ten times last season and 12 times in the 2022/23 season.

Roma have parted company with boss Ivan Juric, the second head coach the Giallorossi have sacked already this season. Juric took charge in September, becoming their third permanent boss in the space of eight months when he succeeded Danielle De Rossi, who himself took the reigns after Jose Mourinho was fired in January. However, he failed to inspire an upturn in their fortunes, with Sunday's 3-2 defeat to Bologna at the Stadio Olimpico being their fourth in their last five league matches. That is more losses than they suffered in their previous 13 Serie A outings (four wins, six draws, three defeats). Since the start of matchday eight, only Como (one) have earned fewer points than the Giallorossi's three.

However, they then experienced a drop-off in form, taking just one point from their next four games in the top flight, before they claimed a much-need win over Holstein Kiel last weekend. Benjamin Šeško and André Silva grabbed a goal apiece to guide Marco Rose’s side to a 2-0 away victory, leaving them in fourth position at the end of matchday 13. Unfortunately for Leipzig, they were unable to take anything from Tuesday’s Champions League home clash against Aston Villa despite coming from behind on two occasions. Ross Barkley’s deflected winner condemned die Roten Bullen to a 3-2 defeat at the Red Bull Arena, leaving them in 34th place without a point to their name after six games. As a result of that dismal record, Leipzig have been eliminated from the Champions League with two matches left to play. They will have to quickly pick themselves up for their second meeting with Frankfurt this month. The hosts will take confidence from the fact they recorded a commanding 3-0 home victory when the two sides faced off in the DFB-Pokal on December 4. In fact, Leipzig have won three of their previous four home games against Frankfurt in all competitions.  The hosts are unable to call upon the injured Xavi Simons, Eljif Elmas, Assan Ouédraogo, Yussuf Poulsen, Castello Lukeba, Amadou Haidara and David Raum. Meanwhile, Arthur Vermeeren will serve a one-match suspension for an accumulation of yellow cards. Frankfurt had enjoyed a run of seven straight competitive victories before they were comfortably beaten at the Red Bull Arena earlier this month. That result proved to be the start of a three-game winless run, which includes a 2-2 draw in last Saturday’s Bundesliga home clash against Augsburg.   Dino Toppmöller’s side then experienced an unsuccessful trip to France for Thursday’s Europa League meeting with Lyon. Ansgar Knauff opened the scoring at the Groupama Stadium, before Lyon netted three goals to take the game away from Frankfurt. Omar Marmoush reduced the deficit in the 85th minute, but it ultimately proved to little too late as die Adler fell to a narrow 3-2 defeat. After losing in Europe for the first time this season, Frankfurt will be looking to produce a response in Sunday’s Bundesliga fixture. The visitors can draw inspiration from the fact they have won four of their last six away league games, including victories in their previous two Bundesliga away outings against Stuttgart and Heidenheim.

Leipzig’s 3-2 loss to Aston Villa on Tuesday confirmed their elimination from the Champions League in the new league phase format. Despite this, Rose will lead Leipzig into the winter break and will start the second half of the season in the dugout at the Red Bull Arena.  However, it cannot be ruled out that Rose will be sacked before the summer if things continue as they are. Former Bayer Leverkusen head coach Roger Schmidt is seen as a ‘shadow coach’ as he has previously been linked with the Leipzig job if Rose were to be sacked.  Reinforcements arriving in the winter transfer window cannot be ruled out as Leipzig are currently in the midst of an injury crisis. While the biggest reinforcement of them all will arrive on January 1st when Jürgen Klopp begins his role at Red Bull Group. Klopp was previously Rose’s head coach at Mainz and would be able to offer advice about tactics and methods to his former defender.  GGFN | Jack Meenan    @2023 - All Rights Reserved.

On top of this, talks between the Bundesliga side and Xavi’s parent club PSG are planned for the new year. However, the 21-year-old will not be making a decision on his future in January as the future of Rose will also play a part.  The next hurdle for Leipzig is the price tag. It has previously been quoted that the Dutch international could cost close to €80m. A fee that is close to unreachable for Leipzig, so a potential payment option for the Bundesliga side would be a €50m payment with PSG then receiving €30m of any future sale.  In addition, Xavi could demand close to €15m salary-wise which would heavily stretch Leipzig’s current salary structure.  Since returning to the Red Bull Arena in the summer, Xavi has struggled to match his levels from last season but that has mainly been due to an ankle injury which has kept him out since October.

Despite dragging themselves level twice on the night, Ross Barkley's late goal gave the English club victory and decided the Saxon club's fate. While there are still two fixtures yet to play, Die Roten Bullen can no longer advance to the knockout round with all teams ranked twenty-fifth or higher on 7 points or greater in the current standings.  As has been the case in Europe all campaign, Leipzig made the worst start imaginable as Aston Villa constructed a lead inside 3 minutes. Some quick feet from Morgan Rogers allowed Matty Cash to cross to the back post. Ollie Watkins' deft flick into the path of John McGinn made for a simple tap-in. Marco Rose's men struggled but received a bit of kind fortune on 27 minutes from which they equalised. Emi Martinez hesitated beneath Seiwald's long ball, which gave Loïs Openda time to round the stranded shot-stopper and slot into an empty net.  Unai Emery's decision to introduce Jhon Duran after the break proved to be a masterstroke. The Colombian worked a couple of nice passes with Rogers and Tielesmans before taking on Orbán and eyeing up the target. His strike from 30 yards dipped just beneath the crossbar with Gulacsi marginally off his line. Duran looked to bag his brace before the hour when he turned home a Matty Cash cross, however the Polish international was in an offside position.  Amazingly, Leipzig responded in another rare foray upfield as Openda found Baumgartner in space to cushion a beautiful, in-step volley inside the left post. Gulacsi kept Lucas Digne at bay entering the last 20 minutes, while a lapse in concentration from Pau Torres gave the visitors a scare when Openda intercepted but released a rather tame shot. Yet lady luck would restore Villa's lead when Ross Barkley's strike deflected off Klostermann and wrong-footed Gulacsi. ",

At 19 years of age, it’s only a matter of time before Antonio Nusa does the same. Born in Langhus, Norway to a Nigerian father and a Norwegian mother, Nusa joined Stabæk‘s youth academy in 2018 and ascended the ranks before eventually making his Eliteserien debut on 30 May 2021. Over the next three months, Nusa would register 3 goals in 13 appearances, including a brace on his full debut vs. Viking, before joining Club Brugge on the final day of the summer transfer window. While his first season abroad mainly took place with Club Brugge’s U19s, Nusa did play once in the Croky Cup, once in the regular season, and twice in the Jupiler Pro League Championship Play-Offs, where he opened his account in Belgium. Union Saint-Gilloise had led the table for 200 days until losing twice to Club Brugge in the playoffs, with Nusa scoring in a 2-0 victory vs. USG and leading them to their first league championship hat-trick since the 1970s. “Nusa is one of the youngsters who’s reminded me the most of Kylian Mbappé in recent years,” said Jacek Kulig of the Football Talent Scout website. “I already spotted his incredible motor skills, bravery, and verticality while watching him for Stabæk. He’s able to combine his elite motor skills with a great amount of bravery, and most importantly, his decision-making is improving so that he won’t be just a speedster in the future.”   Nusa built on this momentum by grabbing an assist in his first league match of the 2022/23 campaign before finding the back of the net on 13 September 2022 in a 4–0 away win against Porto. In doing so, Nusa became the youngest Norwegian player to feature in the UEFA Champions League and the second-youngest player to score in the Champions League behind Ansu Fati (both Lamine Yamal and George Ilenikhena have since surpassed him). Despite registering just 3 goal contributions in 31 first-team appearances, Nusa’s performances attracted the attention of Ståle Solbakken, who gave him his Norway debut on 7 September 2023: Nusa quickly repaid his trust with a goal and an assist in a friendly vs. Jordan before grabbing a brace of assists vs. Georgia and an assist vs. Cyprus in his first two competitive matches. It wasn’t long before the Premier League came calling, with Brentford preparing to launch a €33m plus €4m bid in January 2024, only to pull out due to underlying medical issues with the player’s back and knees. Although Nusa’s 2023/24 season was marred with injuries and a lack of productivity in front of goal (4 goals and 4 assists in 46 appearances), he nevertheless finished joint-third in Club Brugge’s squad for shots per 90 (2.9) and joint-first for possession won in the final third per 90 (0.9), while only Royal Antwerp’s Chidera Ejuke (4.0) completed more successful dribbles per 90 than Nusa (3.8) in the entire Belgian top-flight. It’s why RB Leipzig decided to sign Nusa to a five-year contract, paying €21 million plus €7 million for the teenager. Nusa seamlessly adjusted from Belgium to Germany with a goal contribution in each of his first three appearances, scoring on his debut – a 4-1 win vs. RW Essen in the DFB-Pokal – grabbing the winner vs. VfL Bochum within minutes of coming off the bench, and assisting Loïs Openda’s decisive goal to end Bayer Leverkusen’s 43-match domestic unbeaten run. He was back at it again in October, slicing through Heidenheim’s defense like butter and carving a through ball towards Openda, who cooly finished the sole goal of the match, whilst he also put the seal on a 4-2 victory against St. Pauli in the cup and grabbed a goal and an assist in their 4-3 loss to Hoffenheim on 23 November.   “Nusa started off as a pure No. 10 because Leipzig wanted him to provide exactly what Xavi Simons offers,” said German football consultant Adam Khan. “He’s mobile between the lines and quite athletic for a traditional central player, but Leipzig have recently recognised that his best qualities are as a true winger.” “Leipzig would potentially fear that the left-sided pairing of David Raum and Nusa could be too offensive, but with Raum out injured, they have been more comfortable playing Nusa in a true winger role. Initially, Nusa was often only coming on late in fixtures, but since Xavi Simons got hurt on October 23, he has become a talisman in attack, and he’s probably been Leipzig’s most consistent and impressive attacking weapon since the start of November.” Leipzig’s injury crisis has seen key figures like Simons, Raum, Xaver Schlager and Yussuf Poulsen miss significant periods, and it has also taken a toll on their form. After a run of five losses and a draw – the latest being a 5-1 home drubbing vs. Wolfsburg – Leipzig needed a win on Wednesday to save Marco Rose’s job. Once again, Nusa delivered the goods with a hat-trick of assists en route to a 3-0 win against Eintracht Frankfurt in the DFB-Pokal, whilst he also completed the most dribbles in Leipzig’s 2-0 victory at Holstein Kiel on Saturday. It doesn’t get any easier for Rose’s side, who will host Aston Villa and Eintracht before closing out the year with a trip to Bayern Munich, but in Nusa, they have a rising star who looks set to play not just a vital role for Leipzig, but Norway as well. Having grabbed a brace vs. Slovenia and a goal and assist vs. Kazakhstan in their final two matches of 2024, Nusa is quickly emerging as a key figure in attack for Løvene, and alongside the likes of Erling Haaland, Martin Ødegaard, and Alexander Sørloth, he may just have what it takes to spearhead Norway to their first major tournament since 2000.

By Zach Lowy   From Christopher Nkunku (Chelsea) to Dominik Szoboszlai (Liverpool) to Joško Gvardiol (Manchester City), more and more players are earning lucrative moves to the biggest clubs in Europe after impressing in Saxony. At 19 years of age, it’s only a matter of time before Antonio Nusa does the same. Born in Langhus, Norway to a Nigerian father and a Norwegian mother, Nusa joined Stabæk‘s youth academy in 2018 and ascended the ranks before eventually making his Eliteserien debut on 30 May 2021. Over the next three months, Nusa would register 3 goals in 13 appearances, including a brace on his full debut vs. Viking, before joining Club Brugge on the final day of the summer transfer window. While his first season abroad mainly took place with Club Brugge’s U19s, Nusa did play once in the Croky Cup, once in the regular season, and twice in the Jupiler Pro League Championship Play-Offs, where he opened his account in Belgium. Union Saint-Gilloise had led the table for 200 days until losing twice to Club Brugge in the playoffs, with Nusa scoring in a 2-0 victory vs. USG and leading them to their first league championship hat-trick since the 1970s. “Nusa is one of the youngsters who’s reminded me the most of Kylian Mbappé in recent years,” said Jacek Kulig of the Football Talent Scout website. “I already spotted his incredible motor skills, bravery, and verticality while watching him for Stabæk. He’s able to combine his elite motor skills with a great amount of bravery, and most importantly, his decision-making is improving so that he won’t be just a speedster in the future.”   Nusa built on this momentum by grabbing an assist in his first league match of the 2022/23 campaign before finding the back of the net on 13 September 2022 in a 4–0 away win against Porto. In doing so, Nusa became the youngest Norwegian player to feature in the UEFA Champions League and the second-youngest player to score in the Champions League behind Ansu Fati (both Lamine Yamal and George Ilenikhena have since surpassed him). Despite registering just 3 goal contributions in 31 first-team appearances, Nusa’s performances attracted the attention of Ståle Solbakken, who gave him his Norway debut on 7 September 2023: Nusa quickly repaid his trust with a goal and an assist in a friendly vs. Jordan before grabbing a brace of assists vs. Georgia and an assist vs. Cyprus in his first two competitive matches. It wasn’t long before the Premier League came calling, with Brentford preparing to launch a €33m plus €4m bid in January 2024, only to pull out due to underlying medical issues with the player’s back and knees. Although Nusa’s 2023/24 season was marred with injuries and a lack of productivity in front of goal (4 goals and 4 assists in 46 appearances), he nevertheless finished joint-third in Club Brugge’s squad for shots per 90 (2.9) and joint-first for possession won in the final third per 90 (0.9), while only Royal Antwerp’s Chidera Ejuke (4.0) completed more successful dribbles per 90 than Nusa (3.8) in the entire Belgian top-flight. It’s why RB Leipzig decided to sign Nusa to a five-year contract, paying €21 million plus €7 million for the teenager. Nusa seamlessly adjusted from Belgium to Germany with a goal contribution in each of his first three appearances, scoring on his debut – a 4-1 win vs. RW Essen in the DFB-Pokal – grabbing the winner vs. VfL Bochum within minutes of coming off the bench, and assisting Loïs Openda’s decisive goal to end Bayer Leverkusen’s 43-match domestic unbeaten run. He was back at it again in October, slicing through Heidenheim’s defense like butter and carving a through ball towards Openda, who cooly finished the sole goal of the match, whilst he also put the seal on a 4-2 victory against St. Pauli in the cup and grabbed a goal and an assist in their 4-3 loss to Hoffenheim on 23 November.   “Nusa started off as a pure No. 10 because Leipzig wanted him to provide exactly what Xavi Simons offers,” said German football consultant Adam Khan. “He’s mobile between the lines and quite athletic for a traditional central player, but Leipzig have recently recognised that his best qualities are as a true winger.” “Leipzig would potentially fear that the left-sided pairing of David Raum and Nusa could be too offensive, but with Raum out injured, they have been more comfortable playing Nusa in a true winger role. Initially, Nusa was often only coming on late in fixtures, but since Xavi Simons got hurt on October 23, he has become a talisman in attack, and he’s probably been Leipzig’s most consistent and impressive attacking weapon since the start of November.” Leipzig’s injury crisis has seen key figures like Simons, Raum, Xaver Schlager and Yussuf Poulsen miss significant periods, and it has also taken a toll on their form. After a run of five losses and a draw – the latest being a 5-1 home drubbing vs. Wolfsburg – Leipzig needed a win on Wednesday to save Marco Rose’s job. Once again, Nusa delivered the goods with a hat-trick of assists en route to a 3-0 win against Eintracht Frankfurt in the DFB-Pokal, whilst he also completed the most dribbles in Leipzig’s 2-0 victory at Holstein Kiel on Saturday. It doesn’t get any easier for Rose’s side, who will host Aston Villa and Eintracht before closing out the year with a trip to Bayern Munich, but in Nusa, they have a rising star who looks set to play not just a vital role for Leipzig, but Norway as well. Having grabbed a brace vs. Slovenia and a goal and assist vs. Kazakhstan in their final two matches of 2024, Nusa is quickly emerging as a key figure in attack for Løvene, and alongside the likes of Erling Haaland, Martin Ødegaard, and Alexander Sørloth, he may just have what it takes to spearhead Norway to their first major tournament since 2000.

Leipzig have two difficult games left in the league ahead of the winter break, first against Eintracht Frankfurt next Sunday and then Bayern Munich on Friday on the final Bundesliga matchday before the break. They also have a tough Champions League fixture against Aston Villa, where they could be knocked out at the league phase if they do not win.  There has been a change in fortunes in the past week as Leipzig beat Frankfurt 3-0 in the DFB Pokal before also seeing off Holstien Kiel at the weekend. All the while the club has undergone an injury crisis with Leipzig only having 13 fit senior players for their trip to the North of Germany on Saturday.  A meeting will take place at the Cotteweg training ground over the winter break where there will be an analysis of the first half of the season. Marco Rose’s former manager at Mainz during his playing days, Jürgen Klopp will then join the Red Bull group in January, where he can provide support for the Leipzig head coach.  GGFN | Jack Meenan  @2023 - All Rights Reserved.

The pressure was mounting on head coach Marco Rose after a 5-1 Bundesliga defeat at the hands of Wolfsburg left Leipzig without a win in six consecutive matches. However, a spirited 3-0 DFB-Pokal win over Eintracht Frankfurt and a 2-0 Bundesliga win over struggling Holstein Kiel last week have given the under-pressure Leipzig coach some breathing space. Another important step in the right direction for Leipzig would be to pick up their first Champions League win of the season against an Aston Villa side who have won their last two games against Brentford and Southampton. The Villans have a respectable 10 points in the Champions League, having conceded just once and beaten the likes of Bayern Munich so far. As Leipzig coach Marco Rose has pointed out on a number of occasions, his squad has been hampered by a lengthy injury list, and that will continue to be the case against Villa. Bitshiabu (muscle), Castello (suspended), Elmas (hamstring), Ouédraogo (thigh), Poulsen (thigh), Raum (ankle) and Xavi (ankle) are all out. Hause (knee) and Ramsey (hamstring) are sidelined for the English visitors. Click here to see our predicted RB Leipzig - Aston Villa lineups.",

Despite the high goals, many of the games were close run affairs and with them came a lot of talking points. These are your talking points and recap from matchday 13 in the Bundesliga.  Bayern Munich overcame FC Heidenheim 4-2 to extend their lead at the top of the table to six points. Though it seems like another standard Bayern victory, all is not how it sounds.  Bayern rested Jamal Musiala from their midweek duel with Bayer Leverkusen in the cup and it clearly showed that there was a creative spark missing from the first half.  After Dayot Upamecano gave Bayern the lead but then the Frenchman gifted the visitors their equaliser in the second half.  Enter Jamal Musiala. The 21-year-old made an immediate impact giving Bayern the lead. Leon Goretzka would then make it 3-1, before former Bayern player Niklas Dorsch provided a brief scare. Musiala would then make it 4-2. This result showed that no matter how strong the opponent is, Bayern struggle without Musiala. This is obviously not sustainable as shown earlier on this season when Bayern struggled against Eintracht Frankfurt, Aston Villa and Barcelona. The Friday night game between VfB Stuttgart and Union Berlin turned out to be a cracker and would set the tone for the rest of the matchday.  Union looked comfortable with two goals either side of half time to take a 0-2 lead after 50 minutes. However, a Nick Woltemade brace and a first Bundesliga goal from Atakan Karazor ensured a stunning comeback from the Swabians.  Union looked stunned following the equaliser and never really got going again. Having only conceded 11 goals prior to the game, the collapse was all the more surprising.  The winner for Stuttgart highlighted Union’s complete meltdown as goalkeeper Frederik Rønnow passed the ball to Karazor allowing him to finish with ease.  It’s a welcome win for Stuttgart and shows they still have that fighting spirit which has served them so well over the past 18 months. The win leaves them in 8th and just one point from 5th.  The Ralph Hasenhüttl renaissance is well and truly underway at VfL Wolfsburg. Their thrilling 4-3 victory over Mainz 05 sends them all the way into 5th and well within a shout for Europe next term.  With both sides on a five game unbeaten run going into this one, there was no wonder that forwards dominated the day.  Mainz went ahead early with a great move to set Paul Nebel away who finished into the far corner.  However, Wolfsburg found themselves level just six minutes later, Mohammed Amoura firing home after the keeper’s original stop. The goal was made by the brilliance of Tiago Tomás whose solo run near the touchline created the goal scoring chance in the first place.  Jonathan Burkardt then restored the visitor’s lead five minutes before the break and in doing so became the club’s joint all-time goalscorer in the Bundesliga.  Shortly after the break Amoura turned provided for Tomás whose deflected effort found its way into the net.  Back came Mainz once again with Nebel, which was his first top flight brace of his career and his third goal of the campaign.  Jonas Wind looked to at least salvage a point for Wolfsburg with seven minutes to go, but deep into stoppage time Wind went one better and headed home a freekick to ensure Wolfsburg took all three points.  Wolves unbeaten in six games now and inflict Mainz’s first away defeat since March.  RB Leipzig got back to winning ways with a comfortable 0-2 away victory at Holstein Kiel. Though the hosts had more of the ball and shots, they never really threatened Péter Gulácsi in the Saxon’s goal. The win keeps Leipzig in 4th.  Borussia Dortmund have now failed to win an away game from their opening five away fixtures having draw 1-1 in Mönchengladbach. In fact, BVB have taken just one point from a possible 15 from away fixtures so far. The only positive was that Jamie Gittens found the net again and continues to impress.  Eintracht Frankfurt were held to a 2-2 draw at home to a stubborn FC Augsburg side. A quiet day for Frankfurt’s forward despite the team dominating the ball for most of the game. Perhaps the draw is a little reminder that though Frankfurt are a fun watch, they’re the youngest team in the league and lacked experience when it comes to these types of games.  Elsewhere, there were wins for Werder Bremen at still winless Bochum (0-1), Bayer Leverkusen beat St. Pauli (2-1) and SC Freiburg played out a 1-1 draw with TSG Hoffenheim.  GGFN | Jamie Allen  @2023 - All Rights Reserved.

Timed at 92 minutes and 11 seconds, it was also the latest goal conceded in the competition by Young Boys, who have now failed to score in three successive matches for the first time. © Copyright 2024 FotMob","It looked set to be a frustrating day for Inter at Wankdorf Stadion, but Marcus Thuram stepped off the bench to snatch all three points."

The Spaniard has been enjoying an Indian Summer this season, producing seven goals and four assists in 17 appearances across all competitions. The 37-year-old is coming off a sensational display in the 3-1 victory over Ajax in Amsterdam where he provided Loum Tchaouna with a superb assist before scoring with a lovely curler. According to La Lazio Siamo Noi, Marco Baroni is looking to bank in on Pedro’s scintillating form by fielding him in a pivotal role. The former Barcelona and Chelsea man could start as an attacking midfielder behind Tijjani Noslin who will be filling in for the suspended Taty Castellanos. Boulaye Dia is the one who usually occupies this role, but the Senegalese hasn’t been at his best since his return from a slight ankle problem. He only lasted 45 minutes on Thursday before being replaced by Mattia Zaccagni. The latter will surely return to the starting lineup for the Nerazzurri clash, with Gustav Isaksen tipped to play on the right side. In previous days, Fisayo Dele-Bashiru was suggested as an option, coming in as a third midfielder alongside Nicolo Rovella and Matteo Guendouzi which could effectively change the formation from 4-2-3-1 to 4-3-3. Nevertheless, the in-form Nigerian might have to start on the bench, as Baroni appears more inclined to entrust Pedro with this delicate mission. Your email address will not be published.

The 27-year-old rose to prominence during his time at Fiorentina and was even part of Italy’s Euro 2020 winning squad. However, a series of devastating knee injuries derailed his career, so the Tuscan club decided to release him last summer. Lazio pounced on the opportunity to sign the midfielder on a free transfer, betting on the player’s undoubted talent. However, Castrovilli has yet to showcase his prowess at the Stadio Olimpico. He also missed a month or so due to a meniscus problem that required a small surgical procedure. During his time out, Fisayo Dele-Basiru proved his worth, thus leaving Castrovilli at the bottom of Marco Baroni’s midfield pecking order. So according to Il Corriere dello Sport (via La Lazio Siamo Noi), the Biancocelesti could decide to part ways with the Italian in January, either by releasing him from his contract (which will expire in June) or allowing him to sign for a new club for free. This won’t constitute a capital loss for Lazio since they had also acquired him for free. Therefore, the Roman newspaper believes the next few contests will be decisive on this front. If Castrovilli fails to earn playing and prove he can contribute to the cause, his spell in the Italian capital could be cut short. In this case, Lazio would have some room on their Serie A squad in case they decide to sign a new midfielder in January. However, it should be noted that the former Fiorentina has been omitted from the Europa League list. Your email address will not be published.

There’s nothing but goal difference to separate the teams ahead of the kick-off, with both trailing table-topping Atalanta by six points. Atalanta’s 1-0 triumph at Cagliari on Saturday has ramped up the pressure on Lazio and Inter to get into the win column. Marco Baroni’s men have frequently been there this season. A 3-1 win at Ajax in the UEFA Europa League last midweek solidified their momentum after beating Napoli in a mouth-watering doubleheader.  Last weekend’s 1-0 victory at Stadio Diego Maradona reignited Lazio’s spirits following a disappointing 3-1 defeat at newcomers Parma. Gustav Isaksen’s late winner on a rainy night in Naples restored confidence around the Biancocelesti camp amid hot pursuit of only a third Serie A title in the club’s history.  Inter will be out to hinder Lazio’s chances of returning to the throne for the first time since 1999/20, seeking redemption for a heart-wrenching defeat at Bayer Leverkusen last Tuesday. Nordi Mukiele’s 90th-minute goal denied the Nerazzurri a piece of UEFA Champions League history, knocking them down from a five-game unbeaten start (W4, D1). Simone Inzaghi’s men were minutes away from becoming the first Champions League team to go the first six matches of a new campaign without conceding. It was also Inter’s first scoring blank on the road in five games (W4, L1), heightening the pressure on Lautaro Martinez and his teammates to get a result in Rome. Lazio Despite four defeats across the opening 15 matchdays, Lazio head into proceedings as one of only three sides to have hit double digits in terms of league victories (W10, D1). Most of their good work has come on this ground, where Baroni’s charges boast a near-flawless top-flight record this season (W6, D1). As one of only four Serie A sides yet to lose a home match in 2024/25, Lazio stand out as one of the most formidable hosts in European football (W8, D2). Delivering action from the get-go, they have opened the scoring in seven of those eight wins, highlighting the potential for a quick-fire start.  Given the strength of their opposition, nothing less would do on Monday. However, Lazio won’t shy away from the challenge. They may have slumped to a 2-0 defeat in this corresponding fixture last term, but they had enjoyed a prolific home run against Inter beforehand.  Indeed, three victories from four previous duels at this venue (D1) perfectly encapsulate their ability to rise to the occasion in high-stakes encounters. Inter Inter had to swallow a bitter pill in Germany last week, relinquishing a remarkable 13-game unbeaten streak in all competitions (W11, D2). But it was nothing less than Leverkusen deserved, considering they had the Nerazzurri on the ropes all game.  Whether it was fatigue or Inzaghi’s tactical choice, Inter didn’t look like a team capable of weathering the storm against a high-intensity opponent. However, equipped with confidence from their recent domestic triumphs, the visitors return to Serie A action, searching for a tenth consecutive unbeaten league outing (W7, D2). They’ve been particularly outstanding on the road. Along with Juventus, they’re the only Serie A side yet to lose an away league game this season (W4, D2). It’s also worth noting that they’ve won on their last four top-flight travels, including a 1-0 triumph at this stadium against Roma. That result initiated a run of three successive away league wins ‘to nil,’ bookended by an outrageous 5-0 rout of Hellas Verona in which they scored all goals before the break. In addition to long-term absentee Alessio Romagnoli, Lazio will be without their leading goalscorer, Taty Castellanos, for accumulated yellow cards. On the bright side, Luca Pellegrini and Patric have passed fit for this meeting after minor fitness problems forced them to withdraw in Amsterdam. As for Inter, Francesco Acerbi and Benjamin Pavard remain on the sidelines. It means ex-Lazio star Stefan de Vrij and 24-year-old Yann Bisseck will join forces with Alessandro Bastoni at the back. After commencing on the bench against Leverkusen, Nicolo Barella and Henrikh Mkhitaryan will likely regain their places in the midfield. Lazio (4-2-3-1): Provedel; Lazzari, Gila, Romagnoli, Tavares; Guendouzi, Rovella; Isaksen, Dia, Zaccagni; Noslin. Inter (3-5-2): Sommer; Bisseck, De Vrij, Bastoni; Dumfries, Barella, Calhanoglu, Mkhitaryan, Dimarco; Martinez, Thuram. Although Lazio are perfectly capable of causing an upset, it takes a brave man to bet against Inter. Both sides enter this round in fine form, but the visitors’ strength in depth gives them a cutting edge. Yet, even without Castellanos, the hosts have the tools to topple their former manager. Therefore, our recommendation is to kick back and enjoy the contest. It promises to be a memorable affair. Your email address will not be published.

The Nigerian midfielder had a relatively slow start to life at Formello after making the summer switch from Hatayspor. Nevertheless, he has risen to the plate as of late when the team required his services. He started the last three contests against Napoli in Coppa Italia and then three days later in Serie A, and the most recent one against Ajax in Amsterdam. The young player produced formidable displays on all three occasions which all ended in victories for the Biancocelesti. So according to La Lazio Siamo Noi, Nicolo Rovella and Matteo Guendouzi will resume their partnership in the middle of the park when Lazio host Inter on Monday, but Baroni could also decide to confirm Dele-Bashiru in the lineup, effectively changing the tactical formation from 4-2-3-1 to 4-3-3. In this case, Boulaye Dia would be dropped. The Senegalese has recently made his return to action following a swift stop, but he hasn’t been at his best in his last couple of appearances. Baroni only gave him 45 minutes against Ajax before replacing him with Mattia Zaccagni. The club captain will certainly return to the lineup along with Gustav Isaksen on the wings, while Tijjani Noslin should lead the line with Taty Castellanos serving a ban.

The Biancocelesti have been enjoying a formidable start to the season under Marco Baroni. While his arrival was accompanied by major doubts with the fans being skeptical about his credentials given the lack of experience on the big stage, the tone has certainly changed by now. At the moment, many would argue that the Italian capital side hit the jackpot by appointing the 61-year-old tactician. And if you feel you can emulate Claudio Lotito’s shrewd approach and earn money at an online casino, you should definitely try your luck at olybet and check out the review and bonuses on display. But despite their sensational start to the season across all competitions (Serie A, Coppa Italia and the Europa League), Lazio remain hellbent on improving their squad in the upcoming transfer sessions. According to Il Corriere dello Sport (via La Lazio Siamo Noi), signing a new midfielder will be the first order of business. The Roman newspaper expects Lotito and his sporting director Fabio Baroni to go to work in January to bolster Baroni’s midfield department. The squad currently features five midfielders in Nicolo Rovella, Matteo Guendouzi, Matias Vecino, Fisayo Dele-Bashiru and Gaetano Castrovilli. While this might be sufficient in a 4-2-3-1 formation, the manager has been teasing a switch to 4-3-3 at times, so a sixth member would be needed, especially for a club that looks to compete on several fronts. However, the new signing must be under the age of 22, as the senior list is already saturated – that is unless the club ends up selling a player, which doesn’t seem likely at this point. The first name on Lazio’s shortlist remains Hellas Verona’s Reda Belahyane who made his Serie A debut under Baroni last season before rising to prominence this season, even though Fabiani has recently denied any interest in the young Morocco international. The alternative option is former Roma man Benjamin Tahirovic who is finding little joy at Ajax these days and is seemingly desperate to leave Amsterdam. So it would be interesting to see him returning to Rome through the gates of Lazio. As for the summer, the Aquile will reportedly go hunting for a new right-back, possibly as a replacement for Adam Marusic who is running on an expiring contract, as well as a new centre-back to inject some fresh blood in an aging department.

To find out how to watch Lazio vs Inter in your respective country, check out this verified list of international TV listings. After two disappointing results against Ludogorets and Parma, many feared Lazio had lost their early-season momentum, envisioning a steep decline in form. On the contrary, Marco Baroni’s men responded by beating Napoli twice in the space of 72 hours, and followed it up with a sensational victory in Amsterdam over Ajax to consolidate themselves as the absolute best team in the Europa League this season. In Serie A, the Italian capital side managed to put some daylight between themselves and 6th-placed Juventus. While they remain in 5th place, they are on par on points with Inter (3rd) and Fiorentina (4th) – although these two have a postponed match in hand – and only two points behind league leaders Atalanta. Inter’s recent momentum has been interrupted by a Champions League defeat at the hands of Bayer Leverkusen, but they remain among the favorites to finish in the Top 8 spots. As for the domestic league, they won four and drew one in their last five outings. While the standings show them in third place, They could have been first had they prevailed in their contest against Fiorentina which was delayed due to Edoardo Bove’s horrific fall. So although it hasn’t been smooth sailing for Simone Inzaghi’s men like last season, they’re beginning to show why they were deemed THE team to beat before a ball was kicked this term.

The 32-year-old started his career at his hometown club of Toulouse before being released in 2017. In February 2018, he was poached by Salernitana who were at the time under the ownership of Lazio president Claudio Lotito. After two years in Salerno, he signed for the Biancocelesti in the summer of 2020 and has been on the club’s books ever since. The Ivory Coast international spent two years at Formello under the guidance of Simone Inzaghi and Maurizio Sarri, but never truly carved himself a regular starting berth. Therefore, he spent the previous two campaigns on loan at Empoli and Monza. This summer, the midfielder failed to secure a move away from the Italian capital, so he’s been left on the sidelines, as Marco Baroni couldn’t find him a place on the Serie A and Europa League lists. Therefore, Akpa Akpro is expected to leave in January, and Il Corriere dello Sport (via La Lazio Siamo Noi) claims that Monza would like to bring him back to the U-Power Stadium. Alessandro Nesta’s team is currently struggling to lift themselves above the drop zone, so they could use the services of a savvy veteran. On the other hand, Tuttosalernitana.com (via La Lazio Siamo Noi) is linking the Ivorian with a return to Salernitana who currently lie in the bottom half of the Serie B table, and are facing the threat of relegation to Serie C. In both cases, Akpa Akpro would likely be released for free since his contract with Lazio is set to expire in June. Your email address will not be published.

While the Biancocelesti are wisely looking to invest their cash in a new modern stadium, perhaps you can consider a prosperous investment yourself and play for real money at sweet-bonanza-slot.net Australia where you’ll get to try your luck at the best sweet bonanza slot websites you can find online. As for Lazio, they have been working on possessing their own stadium rather than sharing the Stadio Olimpico with arch-rivals Roma, which has been the case over the past few decades. The Biancocelesti have identified the currently defunct Stadio Flaminio as the ideal solution. Club president Claudio Lotito thus attended a significant meeting at the municipality of Rome to present this project. The Lazio patron revealed after the summit with Mayor Roberto Gualtieri and Councilor Alessandro Onorato that the project was well-received, while revealing that acquiring the necessary paperwork could require another three years (via Calcio e Finanza). They appreciated the work we have done which highlights Lazio’s desire to redevelop the Flaminio stadium, safeguarding its architectural value but above all the area in which the facility is located. We are not only bulding Lazio’s ground, but the stadium of the city of Rome and which will be used by Lazio. We will also redevelop it in terms of traffic, acoustics, greenery and initiatives for the people who live the area. The total cost is circa €400 million. We will do everything to speed up the process, but it will probably take no less than three years to complete . There is a bureaucratic process to follow. For his part, Mayor Gualtieri expressed his delight with the project, noting that Lazio have well and truly done their homework. It went well. President Lotito and his team showed us the pre-feasibility study for the renovation of the Flaminio stadium project. A beautiful project , it will have to be examined in detail but we are happy that it has been announced that the proposal will be formally launched, thus triggering the administrative procedure. Now we will work to examine it in detail. It seems that Lazio has moved from intentions to will, to concrete facts . From here to a few hours we expect that what they presented to us also with video, will become an official request with all the necessary documentation. Your email address will not be published.

The 21-year-old rose to prominence last season at Salernitana. He was one of the few bright lights in an otherwise disastrous campaign in Salerno which culminated in a relegation to Serie B. Nevertheless, the Frenchman was always going to get another crack at top-flight football, so he ended up sealing a move to Lazio for €10 million. While he hasn’t yet carved himself a starting spot in Marco Baroni’s lineup, the youngster is getting significant playing time, especially in the Europa League. On Thursday, he showcased his massive talent by scoring a goal and providing Pedro with an astonishing back-heel assist in the 3-1 victory over Ajax, which has apparently earned him some admirers. According to Spanish website Fichajes.net, PSG are willing to splash €30 million for Tchaouna. This would be a massive windfall for Lazio who would earn triple for their investment shortly following his arrival. This would be a return to France for the Chad native who began his career at Stade Rennais. However, the source notes it could be a risky move on the French champions’ part. Although the winger has displayed flashes of brilliance, he has yet to truly flourish in the Italian capital. This season, he has thus far scored two goals and provided an assist in 17 appearances across all competitions. Your email address will not be published.

The Biancocelesti prevailed over the Lancers on their own turf in Amsterdam by three goals to one, thus maintaining their spot on top of the table. The Italian capital side has been firing on all cylinders since Marco Baroni’s arrival. At this point, it’s hard to bet against the Italian tactician who might as well hit the jackpot should he visit a casino. Speaking of online casino games, if you’re looking for a guide that provides you with all the latest on Sweet Bonanza Fruit Slot and many other cool features, make sure to follow the link. Despite traveling to the Netherlands without their fans who were banned by a controversial embargo imposed by the local authorities in Amsterdam, Lazio still produced a stellar display at the Johan Cruyff Arena, while Pedro emerged as the ultimate star of the show. The 37-year-old provided a fabulous assist on Loum Tchaouna’s opener, picking up the young Frenchman’s run with a clever through ball. The Spanish veteran was the one who eventually sealed the victory with a brilliant curler. Therefore, he was named the Man of the Match by the most renowned Italian newspapers. The former Barcelona man received grades between 7.5 and 8. Tchaouna wasn’t too far behind. The youngster opened the scoring and then repaid the favor to Pedro by setting up the third goal with an outrageous backheel. Fisayo Dele-Bashiru bagged the second goal as his shot went just over the line, so he also earned reputable grades (between 7 and 7.5).

Fixture: Lazio Roma 2-1 A grey, autumnal day witnessed the 97th Roman derby. It was announced as a sell-out but high ticket prices and the world oil crisis (no cars allowed in Rome today) meant the crowd was “only” about 60,000. Roma were keen to avenge the previous season’s two derby defeats but it was Lazio who had the first chances. One of last year’s derby heroes Franco Nanni shot just high and then Renzo Garlaschelli forced keeper Paolo Conti to tip the ball over the bar with a venomous curling cross come shot. Roma held their own and had periods of pressure but mainly crosses which came to nothing. It was Lazio who threatened again but “Long John” Chinaglia’s shot went wide. In the 24th minute, young Vincenzo D’Amico was elbowed by Giorgio Morini and never really recovered. He went off for several minutes and then came on again but did not seem himself. In the 34th minute however Roma took the lead with a superb goal. Piergiorgio Negrisolo picked up the ball outside the area on the right and dribbled past three Lazio players (including a groggy D’Amico) and once inside the box fired a low left-footed shot past Felice Pulici. A great solo effort, Lazio 0 Roma 1. Lazio reacted and Chinaglia freed himself in the area but his powerful shot was blocked by Alberto Batistoni. Halftime Lazio 0 Roma 1. A balanced game so far decided by a moment of brilliance by Negrisolo. For the second half D’Amico did not reappear after his first half problems and was replaced by Paolo Franzoni. The replacement took only a minute to get his name in the Lazio history books. In the 48th minute Mario Frustalupi found Garlaschelli on the right side of the area near the by-line and, despite being challenged by two defenders, he managed to square a cross into the middle where Franzoni twisted and dived, heading in Lazio’s equaliser. Lazio 1 Roma 1. From now on it was more Lazio than Roma. Chinaglia had a thundering free kick saved by Conti and then Sergio Santarini had to clear another Franzoni header off the line, following a clever Luciano Re Cecconi cross with the outside of his foot. Lazio attacked but Roma occasionally eased the pressure on the break. Francesco “Kawasaki” Rocca went on one his customary runs down the left and crossed to Domenghini on the right inside the area, the former Cagliari controlled it well but then fired over the bar. It was Lazio again who went closer. Gigi Martini, who had an excellent game, put a low through ball to Chinaglia in front of goal on the left but Conti came off his line and dived, saving Long John’s shot with his feet. Roma then had another counterattack. A good run by Renato Cappellini who jiggled through Lazio’s defence and teed up Batistoni in the heart of the area but his shot was weak and comfortably saved by Pulici. In the 68th minute Lazio’s pressure paid off. On a Re Cecconi cross from the left Chinaglia and Conti jumped up for the ball, the keeper touched it but could not hold onto it and it bounced free, Chinaglia with his back to the goal twisted and got a shot in that then bounced, deceiving both the keeper and a defender on the line. Not a pretty goal but an important one for the Biancocelesti. Lazio 2 Roma 1. There followed some controversy as the Giallorossi claimed Chinaglia had fouled Conti on the aerial challenge but there was nothing in it, as the evening TV analysis later confirmed. Roma predictably piled forward desperate to avoid a third consecutive derby loss. They went close twice. First Pierino Prati tried an acrobatic bicycle kick which went just wide of the left post and then, with only three minutes remaining, Ciccio Cordova found Domenghini unmarked in the box and his low strike hit the post, came back to him but this time he sent it over the bar. After the scare the last chance was for Franzoni. The unexpected protagonist of the derby was teed up by Chinaglia in front of Conti but on the right, he went for power over precision and hammered the ball which got stuck between the keeper’s legs. Final score Lazio 2 Roma 1. A hard fought, balanced and entertaining game had gone Lazio’s way again. Three in a row now and the Biancocelesti were keeping up with the front runners but today it was all about winning the “Stracittadina” , always a huge satisfaction in Rome against the bitter rivals known as “i cugini” (the cousins).

This showdown will undoubtedly serve as the headliner for Serie A Matchday 16, so Calcio fanatics will be looking to cast their predictions by placing wagers at online casinos on who they think will come out on top. OnlineCasino.si – reviews, opinions and guides will have you covered on this front. But before you play games at the best casinos and the two sides lock horns on the pitch, let’s take a look at some of the key insights and direct duels before giving away our own predictions. As you would expect, the more decorated Inter have a historical advantage. The Nerazzurri prevailed in 68 of their previous 162 league meetings, while the Biancocelesti only emerged victorious in 39 cases. Meanwhile, 55 matches ended in draws. The Beneamata’s advantage is also reflected by the two clubs’ most recent encounters. The last time they met, they shared the spoils in a 1-1 draw that meant little to Inter who had already clinched the Scudetto several weeks prior to that contest, and were more occupied with their post-match trophy ceremony. However, Inter had beaten Lazio on the three previous occasions. This includes the semi-final of last season’s Italian Super Cup by three unanswered goals. Curiously, the two sides also clashed heads at the Olimpico on Matchday 16, with the hosts securing a 2-0 win thanks to their golden attacking duo, Lautaro Martinez and Marcus Thuram. So Lazio will be hoping this doesn’t prove to be a bad omen ahead of Monday’s encounter. In any case, Lazio’s most recent victory over the reigning Italian champions dates back to the third round of the 2022/23 campaign. Maurizio Sarri’s men triumphed by three goals to one, with Ciro Immobile, Luis Alberto and Felipe Anderson all on target. With Francesco Acerbi injured and Taty Castellanos banned, an interesting Dutch duel between Tijjani Noslin and Stefan de Vrij could grab the headlines. The Lazio striker is riding high on confidence, especially following his hat-trick against Napoli. On the other hand, the experienced defender has encountered some difficulties in his most recent outings. Moreover, this contest should witness a clash between Hakan Calhanoglu, who is arguably the best deep-lying in Serie A at the moment, and Nicolo Rovella who is a future contender for the throne. Meanwhile, Matteo Guendouzi and Nicolo Barella will battle it out in a duel between two of the most energetic stars in the league. The two teams are currently embroiled in a five-horse battle for the top spots. While Inter have often had the upper hand over Lazio, the capital side is difficult to beat at the moment, especially at home. And if Noslin can build on his recent momentum, they Biancocelesti could well extend their superb record at the Olimpico Lazio 2-1 Inter Your email address will not be published.

The Biancocelesti had a night to remember in Amsterdam, extending their superb Europa League run by beating the Lancers by three goals to one. Nevertheless, there were some fears over the two defenders who left the pitch while seemingly carrying knocks. But in his post-match press conference (via La Lazio Siamo Noi), Baroni discharged all concerns. The manager revealed that the two players were simply feeling the effects of slight physical problems. Pellegrini and Patric asked me to replace them because they were both recovering from a small problem. The lads are fine, no one has suffered any injury. Moreover, the 61-year-old is expecting to regain the services of another two Lazio players in the shape of Matias Vecino and Alessio Romagnoli ahead of Monday’s major Serie A contest against Inter. I am very confident that I can also recover Vecino and Romagnoli. The Uruguayan veteran has been out of action for several weeks with a muscle injury, while the Italian defender left the pitch in the second half of last Sunday’s Serie A showdown against Napoli after suffering a slight knock. Welcome back to the team lads, you are precious 💙 I don’t believe they will both be fit to start though. Rovella and Guondozi will both play so Dele Bashiru can be a sub for the ACM role and Vecino to cover the two powerhouses in the dm. Again, I expect the same like in Amsterdam: win, draw or lose is irrelevant, leave EVERYTHING you got on the pitch and we will applaud you! Dajeeeee Your email address will not be published.

The Italian has overseen a chaotic period at Lazio rather calmly and after a 1-0 win over Napoli at the weekend, they beat Ajax 3-1 to go the top of the Europa League table. Loum Tchaouna scored the first goal but Bertrand Traore equalised. The second half saw Fisayo Dele-Bashiru and Pedro score to seal all three points. Baroni spoke to Lazio Style Channel after the game and he isn’t surprised by the team. He said, as relayed by LaLazioSiamoNoi: “The team doesn’t surprise me, they know very well what they have to do on the pitch, we were going to concede goals here, in fact in my opinion we missed the ball three or four times to close the game even at 1-0, we could have been more lucid in the transition.” Speaking further about the team’s performances in recent weeks, the Biancocelesti boss said: “Today a good step forward, it’s not a decisive step yet but we’re happy.  “As I said these are great matches, the boys have earned them and we want to raise the level of performance in matches like this. Congratulations to the team, I liked how they interpreted the match. From this evening we have to recover and then we have a few days to prepare for the next match.” Baroni’s appointment at the club was very quick and Igor Tudor was sacked after a tumultous period during the transfer window. There was talk of internal squabble as well but the Italian has managed the situation very calmly in Rome.       Kaustubh Pandey I GIFN   @2024 - All Rights Reserved. Get Football Group",

Marco Baroni adopted his tried-and-tested 4-2-3-1 formation spearheaded by Taty Castellanos with Loum Tchaouna, Boulaye Dia and Pedro as the supporting crew. Nicolo Rovella and Fisayo Dele-Bashiru operated in the double pivot, while Manuel Lazzari, Patric, Samuel Gigot and Luca Pellegrini started in front for Christos Mandas. The Biancocelesti took an early lead with a swift play kickstarted by Dia who outmuscled Kenneth Taylor off the ball. Rovella then picked up Pedro in the hole and the latter fed Tchaouna with a clever through ball. The young Frenchman’s shot was too central, but the power saw it go through the legs of the experienced Remko Pasveer. The Lancers went close to finding an equalizer on several occasions in the first half, but Brian Brobbey sent a couple of headers off target from promising positions, so Lazio maintained their slim lead ahead of the interval. Nevertheless, Ajax were quick to draw level after the break. Pellegrini produced a goal-line clearance while defending a freekick, but Bertrand Traoré was in the right place to smash a powerful shot to the top corner, while Mandas had a poor view. But while the Dutch giants were looking to complete the turnaround, Lazio managed to restore their lead thanks to lovely play from Mattia Zaccagni who entered after the interval. The Biancocelesti captain sent a square ball to the mouth of the goal, but it somehow evaded the crowd to reach Dele-Bashiru who went for power. Pasveer made the save, but the goal had already crossed the line as confirmed by the referee’s device. Both sides had several chances in what an exciting contest as predicted by Baroni, but Pedro eventually sealed the win with a mesmerizing curler following a darting run from Nuno Tavares and a dashing backheel assist from Tchaouna. Therefore, Lazio won the contest by three goals to one to regain their top spot in the 36-team Europa League group stage table. Goals: 11′ Tchaouna (L), 47′ Traorè (A), 51′ Dele-Bashiru (L), 77′ Pedro (L).

Atalanta top the standings on 34 points, two ahead of Antonio Conte's Napoli, with Inter and Fiorentina both one point further back on 31. Reeling from Tuesday's 1-0 loss at Bayer Leverkusen, Simone Inzaghi's side remain without injured defensive pillars Francesco Acerbi and Benjamin Pavard ahead of Monday's visit to his former club. Inter's 573-minute run without conceding a goal in the Champions League ended when Nordi Mukiele scored for Leverkusen in the 90th minute on Tuesday. That capped a miserable trip to Germany for Inter, who failed to record a single shot on target in a Champions League game for the first time since February 2022 (versus Liverpool), and for the first time on record (since 2003-04) in the competition's first round.  Lazio, meanwhile, have racked up consecutive victories over Napoli in league and cup, with the Biancocelesti facing Ajax in the Europa League on Thursday before returning to Serie A action. Inter could be six points off the top by the time they take to the field for that headline fixture, with Atalanta targeting a piece of history at Cagliari on Saturday. Gian Piero Gasperini's Dea side have won nine straight Serie A games to equal their club record, having also won nine in a row between February and July 2020. Another victory would make this their best-ever winning run in the competition. This is only the second time that Atalanta have topped the table at the end of a Serie A matchday since the competition returned to 20 teams in 2004-05, having only managed to do so after the fifth matchday in 2022-23. Until now, Atalanta had never led the top-flight table as many as 15 matches into a campaign. They are big favourites to maintain their winning streak against 15th-placed Cagliari, with Gasperini having no new injury concerns. Giorgio Scalvini is out, having sustained a shoulder injury ahead of Tuesday's Champions League 3-2 loss to Real Madrid, while Gianluca Scamacca and Juan Cuadrado are longer-term absentees. While both Inter and Atalanta were beaten in Europe this week, Juventus claimed a huge result by beating Manchester City 2-0, courtesy of goals from Dusan Vlahovic and Weston McKennie. The Bianconeri's triumph came despite them only having 31% of possession – only once previously on record (since 2003-04) have they won a Champions League game while having a lower share of possession (27% versus Chelsea in September 2021).  In Serie A, however, it has been a case of possession without purpose for Juventus, who remain unbeaten but have drawn nine of their 15 matches, including each of their last three, to sit sixth. ""Nothing bothers me. I perfectly accept all honest judgements, but I won't enter this story,"" Juve coach Thiago Motta said, when asked about criticism of their domestic form. ""I am only focused on my work: improving the team and helping my players. The rest doesn’t count much."" With last-placed Venezia travelling to Turin on Saturday, Motta should be confident of maintaining the feel-good factor built in midweek.  Juventus have dominated this fixture historically, winning 10 of their last 12 Serie A matches against the newly promoted side. Surprise package Fiorentina, meanwhile, are riding high on an eight-match winning streak in Serie A, and they could make history when they travel to Bologna – led by former Viola boss Vincenzo Italiano – on Sunday. Victory for Raffaele Palladino's visitors would set a new club record for successive victories in Serie A, overhauling their long-standing mark from 1960.

Lazio will be eager to retain their place in the top eight to ensure they don’t add any unnecessary fixtures to their already packed schedule. However, with just three points covering the top ten teams and another three sides just a one point adrift of that group, the Serie A giants cannot relax. Their reaming league phase fixtures are fraught with danger, with each of their three opponents still in contention to finish inside the top eight. Lazio’s next fixture is a trip to the Netherlands to face Ajax, who are one of the teams with ten points after their first five games in the competition. The Eredivisie outfit were defeated 2-0 at Real Sociedad in their last outing, but they have looked a fearsome side in their two home matches this season. They scored nine goals without reply against Besiktas and Maccabi Tel Aviv, and Lazio would be well-advised not to underestimate the threat they pose. A home game against Sociedad follows on the agenda and they have the ability to be troublesome if they produce their best form at the Stadio Olimpico. Their victory over Ajax was a statement of intent following a sticky start to the competition and they will fancy their chances of making life difficult for Lazio. The Serie A side will undoubtedly be keen to head into their final game at Braga with their place in the top eight already assured. The Portuguese side moved themselves into contention with an impressive 3-0 victory over Hoffenheim in their last game and are generally tough to beat on their own patch. A minimum five-point haul from the remaining league phase games should be enough to keep Lazio in the top eight and send them straight through to the last-16. Winning the competition is not beyond Lazio given the form they have shown this season, although several other clubs have the ability to scupper their hopes. They include Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester United, who currently top the outright betting for the Europa League with most leading bookmakers. Athletic Bilbao and Sociedad have also been well-backed, while Eintracht Frankfurt and Porto are other teams who could make a deep run in the competition. Frankfurt have been going well in the Bundesliga this term and could be the main threat to Lazio’s hopes of lifting the prestigious trophy. Your email address will not be published.

The 23-year-old had only recently rejoined Juventus following a successful loan stint at Monza, but was still finding difficulties in carving himself a place in Max Allegri’s packed midfield department. So as he revealed in his interview with DAZN (via La Lazio Siamo Noi), Rovella immediately jumped on the opportunity to sign for Lazio. I remember when I was still at Juve in pre-season, Sarri called me and asked me to come to Lazio. I knew there was something and I pushed to come here. When I received the call, I said I wanted to go to Rome. When I arrived I had an injury in pre-season, so I didn’t do much preparation, I was a bit behind physically. So the first month and a half was about adjusting physically, also to understand what Sarri wanted, because tactically he is good, he has clear ideas, but understanding them is not easy straight away. When I adapted, I started playing. Sarri is a master, when he asked me to come to Lazio it was a great honor. I said “Okay, I’ll pack my bags right away”. It took me maybe 10 minutes. After heaping praise on his former Lazio manager, Rovella explained how Marco Baroni is an excellent communicator. Baroni is a good and intelligent person. He asks us a lot, even what we think, he is open to dialogue and this helps us young people to grow and understand mistakes more easily. It is stimulating to form a bond with the coach. He is also good at keeping us with our feet on the ground and taking it one step at a time. Rovella also reveals a friendly rivalry between the Italian and French contingents in the Lazio locker room. When you play football the best thing is having fun. This season, we are having fun and I think it shows. We are a strong group, we are very good friends in the locker room. We have a good relationship with the new players and this is the strength of this Lazio. There are many French and Italians, the two factions. Since Guendouzi has been there it has been a constant battle since we both arrived . The Italian international named Real Madrid midfielder Luka Modric as his role model, and Monza’s Daniel Maldini as his best friend in football. I absolutely adore Modric. Everyone has an idol as a child and he has always been mine. I have always tried to imitate him even if it is impossible. He is an extraordinary player, the thing I like about him is mainly the tranquility he has with the ball at his feet. In the world of football, my best friend is Daniel Maldini, because we grew up together in Milano and we try to see each other often. Then there is also [Luca] Pellegrini who is here in Rome with me and is one of my best friends in the world of football. Finally, Rovella insisted he never wants to leave Rome, and dreams of winning a trophy at Lazio I love Rome, I love it. Obviously for the historical aspect, but also for the way of life. I also met my girlfriend here in Rome and that helped me. The truth is that I would never want to leave here. Seeing the Olimpico on my way back home is beautiful and then I love the historical center, especially at night. I love walking around Rome in the evening when I have the day off. My dream, or rather my goal, is to lift a trophy with Lazio. If not this season, then in the next one. Rome loves you back young lad, impressive future lays ahead 💙 Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked * Comment  Name *  Email *

According to Sky Sport via Calciomercato, Marco Baroni’s men are contemplating a winter bid for the unsettled Ajax midfielder. Tahirovic, who joined Roma from Vasalunds IF in 2021, left the Stadio Olimpico last summer to team up with the Dutch powerhouse. However, the 21-year-old has fallen out of favor with manager Francisco Farioli and is now keen on leaving Amsterdam. Lazio could be his next stop. Despite his past ties with Roma, the surprising Serie A title contenders are considering luring the Bosnia & Herzegovina international back to Italy. However, Lazio are not the only Italian club interested in capturing the services of the ex-Giallorossi playmaker.  After Edoardo Bove’s collapse against Inter earlier this month, Fiorentina are in the market for a new midfielder and could challenge Lazio for Tahirovic’s signature. In addition to Italian giants, Tahirovic has admirers in other European leagues. PAOK and Celtic are willing to fight Lazio and Fiorentina. Meanwhile, Ajax chiefs must be rubbing their hands. The Eredivisie outfit paid Roma €7.5 million to sign Tahirovic a year and a half ago and will aim to recoup their investment.  With a bidding war on the horizon, they’re well-positioned to maximize their gains. As for Lazio, they could use today’s UEFA Europa League encounter against Ajax as a pretense to gather information about the Bosnian starlet. Your email address will not be published.

From the goalkeeper to the striker, everyone needs to play their part. Athletic Club is a team that exemplifies this, but one man in midfield stands out above his peers across the entire league: Oihan Sancet. The man in the middle of the park for the Basque side has put in some incredible performances so far this season, racking up eight goals across 16 appearances this campaign. The 25-year-old leads the way for his midfield peers in La Liga across eight key metrics, as per DataMB; These performances have gone under the radar somewhat, especially amongst those who only watch La Liga for Real Madrid and Barcelona, but Athletic’s good results so far this season has them currently sitting in a Champions League place. The last part of the year could provide a good indicator of where the club may end up this season, as a match against Villarreal who are hot on their tale could predict how their push for Europe might go. While stars like Nico Williams will often take the headlines, it is important to give credit to players behind the scenes like Oihan Sancet, without whom the team wouldn’t be as cohesive a unit. 🇪🇸 Oihan Sancet vs La Liga Midfielders🥇 Goals — 1st🥇 Dribbles — 1st🥇 Shots — 1st🥇 Non-penalty goals — 1st🥇 Expected goals — 1st🥇 Offensive duels — 1st🥇 Attacking actions — 1st🥇 Progressive runs — 1st👨‍💼 Top 7 League profile: https://t.co/Cp0D4PUVWD pic.twitter.com/aoasXs4l2K GSFN | Ciaran Currie @2023 - All Rights Reserved.

Kylian Mbappé missed a penalty for the second time in three games following his spot-kick failure against Liverpool in the Champions League last week.  In his post-match press conference after the loss in Bilbao, coach Carlo Ancelotti admitted Mbappé, who also missed a big opportunity earlier in the second half, wasn’t at his best but offered his backing to the Frenchman and Fede Valverde, who was at fault for Athletic’s winning goal.  🏁 @Athletic_en 2-1 @RealMadridEN⚽ 53' Berenguer⚽ 78' @BellinghamJude⚽ 80' Guruzeta#AthleticRealMadrid | @Emirates pic.twitter.com/8QZBln49Iw How is Mbappé doing?: “I haven’t spoken to him. It was a tough, evenly matched game, fought hard by both sides. When we equalized, we thought we could take control, but small details cost us tonight. We missed the penalty… I don’t judge a player’s performance based on a penalty, which sometimes goes in and sometimes doesn’t. Obviously, he’s sad and disappointed, but we have to move on.” Mbappé has played 20 games, scored 10 goals, and missed two penalties. He doesn’t seem like even 1% of the Mbappé we saw at PSG…: “He’s much more than 1%. He’s not at his best, but we need to give him time to adapt. He’s scored 10 goals and is working hard to improve.” And Fede Valverde?: “The fans are extraordinary. Fede, like Kylian, is sad and disappointed. He made a mistake, but we shouldn’t dwell on it. Fede is a great player. Mistakes happen in soccer, just like in life. We need to focus on the next game.” Do you think the loss was fair? Can you change the penalty taker?: “The game was evenly matched. Athletic is a very dangerous team; we competed and fought hard. I think a draw would have been fair based on the performance of both teams, but I have nothing to say about them winning. I think we defended well in the first half, but we could have done better with the ball. In the second half, we were better in attack and had opportunities. We’re still in the fight. We could have gotten a better result, but we’re here and thinking about Saturday’s game in Girona. Vinicius has taken many penalties and done well. Our penalty takers are Mbappé, Bellingham, and Vinicius.” Carlo Ancelotti and Kylian Mbappé spoke about his missed penalty following Real Madrid's 2-1 loss to Athletic Club.Mbappé said he takes ""full responsibility"" for it. pic.twitter.com/lmIuTXaRwo Did the reaction come too late?: “I don’t think so. Athletic took the lead, and then we played with a different intensity. It wasn’t too late because we equalized in the 78th minute and thought we could control the game.” Does it bother you when people question whether Mbappé should take penalties?: “It doesn’t bother me; it’s part of soccer. I think both [Bellingham and Mbappé] talked, and he took the responsibility but didn’t take it well. This can happen in soccer.” What do you think about the disallowed goal and the referee ignoring VAR?: “I didn’t see the play. It seemed like they were looking at offside and then the penalty. He called to review the situation and decided not to give the penalty.” What’s stranger: the three league losses this season or losing only one game last year?: “It’s stranger to have five losses [in all competitions] in a short time. We agree that we need to improve. We’ve improved some aspects in recent games, but we’re still not as solid as we were last year. The last two losses came in very tough stadiums. Now, little by little, we’ll recover players and improve our level.” REAL MADRID FIFA Club World Cup Original article written by Javier R.

Carlo Ancelotti’s team would have remained a point behind Barça with a game in hand had they won at San Mamés but their loss means the Catalans remain in the driving seat…although only just.  Álex Berenguer put Athletic ahead early in the second half before Mbappé squandered two big opportunities to equalise. First, he shot straight at Julen Agirrezabala when all along inside the penalty area 10 minutes before his tame spot-kick was parried by the goalkeeper.  Jude Bellingham and Antonio Rudiger went over to console Mbappé after the penalty incident 🇫🇷🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿Bravo Jude & Rudi 👏 pic.twitter.com/fRdhN1iKDd Exactly a week earlier, the French attacker had seen an almost identical penalty saved by Liverpool’s Caoimhin Kelleher, also when Madrid were 1-0 down in the second half of their 2-0 Champions League defeat to Arne Slot’s team. Like at Anfield, the miss proved extremely costly as Athletic went on to win the contest despite Jude Bellingham briefly levelling.  After the game, Mbappé took to Instagram to confess that his penalty miss played a huge part in deciding Real Madrid’s fate. The 25-year-old did, however, vow to bounce back, with “what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger” very much his message.  “Bad result. A big mistake in a match where every detail counts. I take full responsibility for it. A difficult moment but it’s the best time to change this situation and show who I am,” the attacker posted in English.  The former Paris Saint-Germain star has scored 10 goals (and provided two assists) in 19 games since joining Real Madrid, a fine return for most strikers but arguably not for a player considered to be one of the best in the world in the last few years.  REAL MADRID FIFA Club World Cup Mbappé and Madrid will quickly have an opportunity to put things right as they are back in action on Saturday (December 7), travelling to Girona in LaLiga (kickoff at 3pm ET).

Tchouaméni comes into Madrid’s line-up in Bilbao today, just under a month since the Frenchman suffered an ankle injury in the team’s Champions League defeat to AC Milan. Speaking to reporters yesterday, Ancelotti said: “He [Tchouaméni] is looking really good - he’s trained well and recovered well. He’s fit to play from the off.”  📋✅ Our starting XI!   🆚 @Athletic_en#AthleticRealMadrid pic.twitter.com/vBdel2MGGt Following Éder Militao’s serious knee injury last month, Tchouaméni had been expected to fill in for the Brazilian at center-back once he returned; however, 21-year-old Raúl Asencio has impressed in central defense in Tchouaméni’s absence. The Spaniard will start alongside Antonio Rüdiger in the Basque Country. On the left-hand side of the Madrid defense, full-back Fran García will keep his place, having earned praise from Ancelotti for his performance in Los Merengues’ weekend LaLiga win over Getafe. García will start ahead of Ferland Mendy, who gave an unconvincing display in the Champions League defeat to Liverpool a week ago. In midfield, the return of Tchouaméni allows Ancelotti to deploy Fede Valverde on the right flank, with the task of helping right-back Lucas Vázquez to keep Athletic winger Nico Williams in check. In attack, Rodrygo Goes is the favorite to partner Kylian Mbappé, with Vinícius Júnior currently unavailable due to a hamstring injury. Thibaut Courtois; Lucas Vázquez, Raúl Asencio, Antonio Rüdiger, Fran García; Fede Valverde, Dani Ceballos, Aurélien Tchouaméni, Jude Bellingham; Rodrygo Goes, Kylian Mbappé. 📋✅ Our squad for the match!🆚 @Athletic_en#AthleticRealMadrid pic.twitter.com/Avwv0SAW8T Athletic Club and Real Madrid meet tomorrow, Wednesday December 4, on matchday 19 of the 2024/25 LaLiga season.

He is very focused, we want him to continue like this. He is making a great effort because he has a problem with his ankle and is playing with some pain,” explained Athletic manager Ernesto Valverde. The player himself was equally delighted with his contribution and knows his team can achieve great things this term if they can keep up their momentum. “Everything went well, I scored two goals to win. I’m happy, we’re near the top of the table. I’m happy to help with goals. I hope I can continue like this,” insisted the 24-year-old. “The goal is to finish as high as possible, we are going to dream of the Champions League, but we are still in December. We don’t set limits for ourselves, we have to take it game by game, but there’s no reason we can’t fight for the top spots.” Bringing his goal tally up to eight on the season (seven in LaLiga, one in the Europa League), not only has he already surpassed his tally from last term (six), but he’s also the highest scoring midfielder in LaLiga and joint-second for goals among midfielders in Europe’s top five leagues behind only Cole Palmer. Carrying on his exceptional rise, where he’s especially shone in the last two-and-a-half campaigns, the Spanish international and 2023/2024 Copa del Rey winner’s been a joy to watch. Such a uniquely skilled player and one who brings so much to the table on both sides of the ball, there’s no denying what a key driving force he is for Valverde’s expertly coached Athletic. An instrumental figure in connecting the midfield and attack from his hybrid No. 8 / No. 10 role within Valverde’s base 4-2-3-1/4-3-3, his presence is vital in helping his team progress upfield in many ways. A master at recognising and exposing weaknesses in opposition structures, it’s always notable how successfully he exploits space between the lines and in the half spaces. Moreover, how he drops deep into central midfield to form numerical and positional superiorities is another important string to his bow. Helping give his team control when checking towards the ball, another thing that warrants mention is how he coalesces smoothly with his colleagues to help manufacture space by drawing opponents and executing rotations, as the above is integral at unbalancing defensive shapes. Reading the play intelligently and awake to gaps to attack in behind and into the box, his surges into depth amplify his effectiveness while adding verticality and directness. As can be seen by his shot map, it’s clear how superbly he times and angles his runs into the area to be an option, which, in combination with his instinctive finishing, makes him a tremendous threat in and around the box.   Standing a towering 188 cm and using his hulking frame to his advantage, this sees him act as an ideal target man and outlet when his team need to go long to beat the press or quickly clear. Picking up the ball’s trajectory swiftly and timing his leap well, his aerial prowess is extremely beneficial to help his team win second balls via headed flick-ons or knock-downs.   Furthermore, his ability to hold the ball up with his back to goal while remaining balanced and maintaining his composure enables him to bring others into play, lure out markers and win fouls in quality zones.  A fantastic reference point and always on hand for teammates to utilise in transition and measured build-up, his presence ensures Los Leones can hurt opponents in a variety of manners. Accompanying the aforementioned with his incisive passing, he’s showcased on countless occasions how valuable he conjures chances for teammates. Be it obliging runners with considered through balls, linking play with slick combination play, switching the angle of attacks with aplomb or breaking the lines with precision, he has a pass for most situations even if his numbers are down on last season at this stage.    Additionally, the way he flexes his muscles on the dribble to maraud upfield enhances his impact, for he’s so tough to stop when in full flight and crucially can outfox opponents with power and finesse. Mightily effective on the defensive end as well, Sancet enjoys hunting down opponents and leading Valverde’s fierce high-press. Combative, disruptive and boasting an enviable work rate, watching him frequently regain possession for his team is definitely an endearing factor of his game. Robust in the tackle, knowing when to drop off, shift across or push up and excellent at blocking passing lanes behind him, getting these details spot on duly accentuates what a complete package he is. One of a number of talented generation from the Basque Country and Athletic’s Lezama academy in particular, such as fellow national team regulars Unai Simón, Kepa Arrizabalaga, Aymeric Laporte and Nico Williams, it was intriguing hearing his thoughts on his development.  “In the north, football is taught very well,” he asserted after his first Spain call-up that saw him reunite with his former Spain U18 and U21 coach in Luis de la Fuente. “There is a high level, the people of the Basque Country really like to play football. Reaching the national selection is the dream of every player. You train and fight to be at the top, so of course it is a dream and an objective achieved.” Phenomenally talented and destined to achieve huge things in the beautiful game, it’s little wonder the Spanish ace is attracting interest from a host of elite clubs such as Manchester City, Liverpool, Inter Milan and Aston Villa. He won’t come cheap, however, given his talent and that Athletic typically demand hefty sums for their stars due to their recruitment policy of only signing Basque players.  Furthermore, the fact he signed a remarkable contract extension until 2032 last year, and it’s understandable why the reported fee to acquire his services is believed to be in the region of €80 million. All that talk will have to wait for now, though, for the multifaceted Sancet’s firmly focused on improving his game in his pursuit to reach the top of the sport and to keep along his sharp upward trajectory.

In his press conference today ahead of Real Madrid’s trip to Bilbao to take on Athletic Club, Carlo Ancelotti has confirmed that Aurélien Tchouaméni will be back for the match. ‘Tchouaméni is ready to play from the first minute. We’ll see tomorrow where he plays,’ Ancelotti said, raising questions about the position the French star could adopt in tomorrow’s match. The match tomorrow will be Tchouaméni’s first in around a month, as he last played in Madrid’s Champions League loss against AC Milan at the start of November. He most recently has played in midfield for Los Blancos but has also been adapted to play in central defence on occasion this season when the need has arisen. Real Madrid’s fans will be happy to see the 24-year-old make his return to action, as the club has sorely needed some rotation in recent weeks as it has seemed their players have been dropping like flies. ⚪️ @MrAncelotti, en rueda de prensa🇫🇷 ""Tchouaméni está listo para jugar desde el primer minuto.

Nevertheless, the former Manchester United man remains a trusted option on the part of boss Ernesto Valverde, as well as being an important voice in the dressing room. In turn, it will come as a blow for Los Leones to learn that Herrera is primed for a fresh spell out of action over the weeks ahead.

The former Fortuna Düsseldorf and Schalke 04 forward was struggling to find a new club after leaving Anderlecht in February and then Samsunspor in the summer. He ended up at KV Mechelen and has scored eight goals in 15 games. His late goal against Club Brugge was his fifth goal in just six games this season. If he keeps up this goalscoring form this season, the 30-year-old should surpass his 12 goals in 44 games for Anderlecht during the 2021/2022 season, the best of his career.  Raman really broke out during his time with Fortuna. He was a key member of the side that won the 2 Bundesliga during the 2017/2018 season and grabbed 11 goals in their Bundesliga campaign the season after. He joined Schalke and struggled to replicate the form he had shown with Fortuna. After his move to Anderlecht, the striker fell out of favour.  Most of Raman’s success this season has come from the bench. Besnik Hasi has used the lively forward as a substitute to great effect. Despite his goalscoring exploits in recent weeks, Hasi has been hesitant to start the forward. While Raman may prefer to start, it is hard to argue against what Hasi is doing. Raman has been great in short spells so far and gives Hasi a goal threat off the bench.  GBeNeFN | Ben Jackson @2023 - All Rights Reserved. Get Football Group",

The 2-2 draw means that Anderlecht remain unbeaten in the competition with three wins and two draws. Porto, on the other hand, have only won one of their five matches in the competition, with this being their second draw.  The away side took the lead from the spot with a generous penalty decision. Wanderson Galeno made no mistake from the spot to give the side a 1-0 lead going into half-time. However, the Brussels club came out of the dressing rooms quicker, with teenager Tristan Degreef making up for his involvement in the penalty to fire home an equaliser. Porto looked to have won it late on when Fabio Veira scored immediately after coming off the bench. However, just three minutes later in the 86th minute Amuzu struck. The winger’s shot from the edge of the box was deflected and looped over Diogo Costa into the back of the net.  Anderlecht should be confident of qualification with Slavia Prague, Viktoria Plzen and Hoffenheim to come. Porto face FC Midtjylland, Olympiacos and Maccabi Tel Aviv in their final three fixtures.

The striker grabbed a brace at the weekend as the side won 6-0 at home to Gent, who ended the game with just nine men. Anderlecht have won three and drawn one of their Europa League matches this season.  Porto, on the other hand, have only won one of their four European fixtures. The side are usually strong in Europe but are struggling this season. This has also been the case domestically in recent weeks. Porto have lost their previous three, including a 2-1 loss to Lazio, a 4-1 defeat to Benfica in the league and then a 2-1 cup defeat to Moreirense on Sunday. Wanderson Galeno has scored 11 goals in 18 games this season, while youngster Samuel Omorodion leads the side with an impressive 12 goals in 14 games.  A win for Anderlecht should guarantee their place in the next round and potentially the top six, with Slavia Prague, Viktoria Plzen and Hoffenheim to come. Porto face FC Midtjylland, Olympiacos and Maccabi Tel Aviv in their final three matches.  GBeNeFN | Ben Jackson  @2023 - All Rights Reserved. Get Football Group",

Charleroi are certainly one of those sides, as they slip further into trouble. Club Brugge will hope that Union can do them a favour against Genk to close the gap at the top.  Sint Truiden v Mechelen A frustrated Sint Truiden welcome Mechelen to the Stayen on Friday evening. The side were wrongly denied an equaliser against Standard Liege last weekend as a good run of form came to an end. Mechelen rescued a point late on in their game last weekend against Union. Last season the Canaries won all four games that the sides played against each other in the regular season and the play offs.  Kortrijk v Antwerp Antwerp have been in good form against sides that are not considered to be title challengers this season. Kortrijk are certainly a side they will fancy their chances against. Despite a win over Beerschot, the side were lackluster against Anderlecht last weekend a rarely troubled Colin Coosemans in goal. The side are yet to reach double figures for goals this season, whereas their opponents already have 25.  Dender v OH Leuven Dender are struggling after a decent start to the season, with just one win in their last five. OH Leuven have also only won noe of their last five in the league. Both sides recent wins were against Charleroi, and both would have circled this one as a winnable game when the fixtures were announced. OH Leuven should have taken a point or three at home to Club Brugge last weekend, whereas Dender are also struggling to convert chances. This could be a low scoring affair.  Charleroi v Westerlo  Charleroi are in a terrible state. The side are spiralling into a relegation battle and now welcome Rik De Mil’s former side Westerlo on Saturday evening. Fans are already planning a 12 minute protest prior to the game, not entering the stadium until the 13th minute. The side have looked beyond poor in their last few games, whereas Westerlo have performed well even without getting many points, apart from lats weekend against Dender. They will fancy heaping more misery on the Zebras this weekend.  Cercle Brugge v Anderlecht Anderlecht travel to Brugge with a growing injury list. Neither Ludwig Augustinsson nor Leander Dendoncker travelled to Latvia for the Europa League clash with RFS. Both sides drew their European matches during the week, with 10 man Cercle holding out against LASK in Austria. Anderlecht looked to have secured a late win over RFS, only for a Moussa N’Diaye own goal in stoppage time seeing them leave Latvia with just a point.  Gent v Standard Liege Gent edged out Omonia Nicosia during the week thanks to goalkeeper Davy Roef. The goalkeeper might be busy against Standard, although their ability to take their chances has been lacking. Gent should, if they have any ambitions of challenging for the title, be able to beat a poor Standard side at home. However, the problems of inconsistency that have plagued the side in recent seasons appear to still be there in 2024.  Union St Gilloise v Genk Genk are looking like the team to beat this season. They have won each of their last three games 2-0 and were comfortable in all of these. Union on the other hand are struggling. They played well against Roma in the Europa League, but could not grab all three points. Goals have been hard to come by for the Brussels based side, not something that Genk have struggled with. However, in the past, this is the sort of game that Union would rise to.  Beerschot v Club Brugge Beerschot have a huge challenge on Sunday evening. Club Brugge were excellent in the week beating Aston Villa in the Champions League and will hope to coast through to victory over the basement side this weekend. Beerschot showed signs of life against Anderlecht a few weeks ago and have only lost one of their last five matches. Club, on the other hand, have won four on the bounce. Beerschot are already facing a gap of nine points to safety.  GBeNeFN | Ben Jackson – Author of The Africa Cup of Nations: The History of an Underappreciated Tournament @2023 - All Rights Reserved.

PSG claimed a vital 3-0 Champions League win over Salzburg in midweek, yet they remain at risk of missing the cut for the competition's knockout-stage play-offs, with just seven points from six games. Their domestic form has been far better, with the Ligue 1 champions remaining unbeaten after 14 matches ahead of Sunday's clash with Lyon at the Parc des Princes. However, they have drawn their last two games in Ligue 1 – 1-1 versus Nantes and 0-0 against Auxerre, allowing Marseille to cut their lead at the top of the table to five points. They could now go three straight games without winning in the same Ligue 1 season for just the second time in three years, having also done so between February and March this year. However, PSG dominated in both of their draws, recording 24 shots in both matches, with 10 on target versus Nantes and 11 against Auxerre. Luis Enrique believes that is a good metric by which to measure their displays, saying: ""Statistically, it's my best season as a coach.  ""Even if you criticise, if there are lies invented, it's my best in terms of numbers, on the chances generated by us and the chances given away to the opponents. ""I've had seasons with great success. But I only see positive things here.

""There have been difficulties in the Champions League, but it is a process of growth which depends on the ability to overcome problems. The level of training is rising, the players are better every day... This is the best season of my career.""  PSG are largely on track according to their underlying figures in Ligue 1, scoring 35 times from 37.47 expected goals (xG, excluding own goals) and conceding 11 from 11.83 expected goals against (xGA). Bradley Barcola is one PSG player who has struggled in front of goal recently, going three league matches without scoring after netting 10 times in the first 11 games. Luis Enrique believes Barcola is still contributing, adding: ""Bradley has been decisive in every game. You judge him on assists or goals, but football is a much more complex sport. ""A player can be key without scoring or getting an assist. What is important is that the 11 players attack or defend together. That is the objective. Who wins the best player award, it is not important for us."" Sunday's opponents Lyon have won their last four matches across all competitions, including impressive victories over Qarabag and Eintracht Frankfurt in the Europa League, so Luis Enrique expects a difficult assignment. ""We know Lyon well. It's an opponent who is in very good form at the moment, well ranked both in Europe and in Ligue 1,"" the Spanish tactician added.

Ernest Nuamah's fine 54th-minute effort proved decisive, with Omar Marmoush's late goal ultimately proving a consolation for Eintracht. Marmoush has been in sensational form this season, but was left on the bench by Dino Toppmoller until after Eintracht were 3-1 down. Nuamah hammered into the top corner four minutes after Malick Fofana had put Lyon 2-1 up, with those goals coming after Rayan Cherki had cancelled out Ansgar Knauff's opener in the first half. The victory takes Lyon into fourth place in the standings, one spot above Eintracht. Data Debrief: First of its kind Lyon had won just one of their last five home games against German sides in all competitions (D2 L2), but they snapped that run in their first ever meeting with Eintracht, who suffered a first defeat to a French opponent since losing 2-0 to Sochaux in the 1980-81 UEFA Cup. Marmoush did get his customary goal contribution for the visitors, at least. He has now been involved in six goals in the Europa League this term (four goals, two assists). The only Egyptian player to be involved in more goals in a single Europa League campaign was Mohamed Salah last season (eight - five goals, three assists).

Marmoush has been in sensational form this season, but was left on the bench by Dino Toppmoller until after Eintracht were 3-1 down. Nuamah hammered into the top corner four minutes after Malick Fofana had put Lyon 2-1 up, with those goals coming after Rayan Cherki had cancelled out Ansgar Knauff's opener in the first half. The victory takes Lyon into fourth place in the standings, one spot above Eintracht. Data Debrief: First of its kind Lyon had won just one of their last five home games against German sides in all competitions (D2 L2), but they snapped that run in their first ever meeting with Eintracht, who suffered a first defeat to a French opponent since losing 2-0 to Sochaux in the 1980-81 UEFA Cup. Marmoush did get his customary goal contribution for the visitors, at least. He has now been involved in six goals in the Europa League this term (four goals, two assists). The only Egyptian player to be involved in more goals in a single Europa League campaign was Mohamed Salah last season (eight - five goals, three assists). © Copyright 2024 FotMob","In-form Omar Marmoush scored again for Eintracht Frankfurt, but the German side lost 3-2 to Lyon in the Europa League on Thursday."

As has been widely reported, the club’s finances are being seriously squeezed – something we reported on here – and it could even result in their enforced relegation unless things improve considerably, through likely player sales. One of the players who has become a serious transfer target in recent weeks is Rayan Cherki, who’s been billed as Lyon’s best academy graduate since Karim Benzema burst onto the scene in the mid to late 2000s, which is no small feat. Cherki’s breakout 2022/23 season appeared to back up that assessment, when he was among the league leaders in chances created per 90 and expected assists per 90. Following a less impactful 2023/24 campaign, and numerous transfer rumours over the summer, Cherki has arguably been back to playing some of his best football in a Lyon shirt this season. In some ways, Cherki plays the kind of football one would remember from a bygone era. He looks the part of an old school playmaker who floats around and would be tasked with tons of progressive passing and ball-carrying responsibilities, while also being a focal point in the final third. He’s constantly looking to create quick combination sequences with nearby teammates. Few players in the world have his repertoire of passes (backheels, throughballs, dink passes, etc.), aided by him being genuinely two-footed to afford him more angles. This is combined with an aggressive mindset to play passes into advantageous areas, yet not going overboard with too many mindless attempts at those Hollywood balls. It’s hard to pick holes in his ability as a playmaker, something you don’t often say about young attacking talents.   For someone who’s not a speedster nor possesses a lightning first step, Cherki’s dribbling numbers are ridiculous and have consistently been at a very high level since he got into the first team back in 2021. This season, he’s completing 3.80 dribbles per 90 at a 56.8% success rate in Ligue 1. Amazingly, his successful dribbles per 90 rate is lower than the previous two seasons. At a young age, he’s already masterful when it comes to going at his own pace. While no one would call him fast exactly, he can change gears to keep his opponent off balance. Being close to ambipedal also helps in making it tough for defenders to show him a certain direction. Cherki’s second assist vs Rangers in the Europa League from their meeting in early October was a good illustration of why he’s tough to contain. The assortment of fakes, change of pace, and ability to use his right foot for the square pass to Malick Fofana were all on display.    Without the ball is where there are some question marks about Cherki’s game, both defensively and in attack. Out of possession, he has his issues with effectively covering his man. He also doesn’t have the most robust engine defensively, although that’s improved compared to previous season, and his usage offensively means it’s draining to be both a defensive and offensive asset. In attack, Cherki isn’t someone who’ll constantly spam runs in behind against high defensive lines. Rather, it comes through situations like third man runs or providing an underlapping option towards the wide zone. Occasionally, he’ll move across the pitch to help drag his marker and create space for others. This helps explain why the shot map below is relatively uninspiring, and how he’s been just under 0.10 non-penalty expected goals per shot per throughout his career.   Since becoming a regular starter in the 2022/23 season, Cherki has been a very good player in Ligue 1, which is no small feat considering he’s not turning 22 until next August. Footballers who provide positive value at such a young age have a good chance of becoming a star going forward. This is part of the glass half full argument with Cherki, in addition to believing that his ability to function in tight areas and subtle off-ball movement would work anywhere. Skeptics would argue that his combination of heavy on-ball dominance and questionable defensive play would make it tough for him to scale up and have similar impact alongside supremely talented teammates. They would say that Cherki would need a special environment for him to be at his absolute best. Players like Martin Ødegaard and Florian Wirtz are examples of how gifted playmakers can still perform at the highest level of play in today’s game. They are the creative engines of Arsenal and Bayer Leverkusen respectively, two of the best clubs in the world right now. While having a high on-ball usage, they also play an important role defensively for how they press in aggressive setups. This is one of the questions concerning Cherki’s portability as a player, as the best teams today don’t carry passengers. While he’s gotten better in this area compared to a couple of years ago, it still can be a sore spot.   If Lyon do sell Cherki in the upcoming January transfer window, to appease French soccer’s financial watchdog, clubs looking to acquire him will have to weigh up several factors. Perhaps the biggest one is whether his out of possession work can reach another level through different coaching. Just how much will his prolific dribbling and ball-carrying translate elsewhere. Will the off-ball movement and directness continue the upward trends from what’s been seen so far this season. Of all the teams who’ve been reported to have an interest, Bayer Leverkusen might be the most interesting one given he might serve as a replacement for Florian Wirtz in the event the German does depart to one of Europe’s super clubs.  Between his production at a young age, unique skill-set, and his availability due to outside circumstance; it’s fair to say that Rayan Cherki is one of the most fascinating young talents in recent memory.

However, they then experienced a drop-off in form, taking just one point from their next four games in the top flight, before they claimed a much-need win over Holstein Kiel last weekend. Benjamin Šeško and André Silva grabbed a goal apiece to guide Marco Rose’s side to a 2-0 away victory, leaving them in fourth position at the end of matchday 13. Unfortunately for Leipzig, they were unable to take anything from Tuesday’s Champions League home clash against Aston Villa despite coming from behind on two occasions. Ross Barkley’s deflected winner condemned die Roten Bullen to a 3-2 defeat at the Red Bull Arena, leaving them in 34th place without a point to their name after six games. As a result of that dismal record, Leipzig have been eliminated from the Champions League with two matches left to play. They will have to quickly pick themselves up for their second meeting with Frankfurt this month. The hosts will take confidence from the fact they recorded a commanding 3-0 home victory when the two sides faced off in the DFB-Pokal on December 4. In fact, Leipzig have won three of their previous four home games against Frankfurt in all competitions.  The hosts are unable to call upon the injured Xavi Simons, Eljif Elmas, Assan Ouédraogo, Yussuf Poulsen, Castello Lukeba, Amadou Haidara and David Raum. Meanwhile, Arthur Vermeeren will serve a one-match suspension for an accumulation of yellow cards. Frankfurt had enjoyed a run of seven straight competitive victories before they were comfortably beaten at the Red Bull Arena earlier this month. That result proved to be the start of a three-game winless run, which includes a 2-2 draw in last Saturday’s Bundesliga home clash against Augsburg.   Dino Toppmöller’s side then experienced an unsuccessful trip to France for Thursday’s Europa League meeting with Lyon. Ansgar Knauff opened the scoring at the Groupama Stadium, before Lyon netted three goals to take the game away from Frankfurt. Omar Marmoush reduced the deficit in the 85th minute, but it ultimately proved to little too late as die Adler fell to a narrow 3-2 defeat. After losing in Europe for the first time this season, Frankfurt will be looking to produce a response in Sunday’s Bundesliga fixture. The visitors can draw inspiration from the fact they have won four of their last six away league games, including victories in their previous two Bundesliga away outings against Stuttgart and Heidenheim. As a result, they now have the chance to clinch three consecutive away league victories for the first time since May/June 2020. The visitors are without Aurèle Amenda and Tuta due to ankle and calf injuries respectively.",

Germany's RheinMainAdler were overpowered by a superior Olympique Lyon side at the Groupama Stadium on Thursday evening.  Toppmöller actually defied both versions of his projected lineup, positioning Tuta as a sweeper ahead of a back-three of Arthur Theate, Robin Koch, and Nnamdi Collins. Niels Nkounkou and Ansgar Knauff served as wingbacks alongside the midfield tandem of German internationals Mahmoud Dahoud and Mario Götze. Hugo Ekitiké and Fares Chaibi worked together in a two striker set.  The German guests found themselves lucky not fall behind early when former Bayern man Corentin Tolisso struck the post in the 7th. Former Arsenal striker Alexandre Lacazette then produced the next chance in the 11th, shooting wide only to the fact that Collins flustered him with close marking. Frankfurt didn't necessarily begin the match terribly despite the disadvantage in chances.  It was such that, when Ansgar Knauff scored the opener in the 19th, it didn't feel undeserved. An excellent through-ball from Götze and delicately placed cross set Knauff up. The finish off the volley was also worth seeing. Lyon nevertheless quickly struck back via a player heavily linked with a Bundesliga move this summer. Rayan Cerki skills tipped in a Tolisso distance effort to equalize in the 27th. Toppomöller's side had great difficulty coping with the fast-paced attacks of their hosts for the duration of the opening 45. Only the post saved SGE keeper Kevin Trapp - once again looking shaky - in the 36th. Somehow, the first-half ended without Lyon scoring another goal.  Toppmöller attempted to shore up his weak left flank by introducing Rasmus Kristensen for Nkounkou at the half. The Germans appeared more alert for about all of five minutes. Cherki tore through the SGE ranks on a counter in the 50th, ultimately setting up Malick Fofana's 2-1. Three minutes later, Cherki then registered an assist on the 3-1. In complete confirmation that Toppmöller's personnel management wasn't working, Ernest Nuamah totally toasted substitute Kristensen on the third goal. Toppmöller reacted by introducing Marmoush and Can Uzun in the 64th. The two substitutes would eventually combine to pull a goal back five minutes from time. Marmoush's poached 85th-minute 2-3 would still come too little, too late. The seven-plus minutes of injury time featured several hard fouls and a series of bookings from Andris Treimanis. Matters culminated in Toppmöller himself losing control of his emotions and being thrown off the pitch on a straight red.  ",

Many considered Dino Toppmöller's SGE dark horse title-race contenders until the last two fixtures. Eintracht look to get back on track, regaining the form that enabled them to win seven matches on-the-bounce prior to the Pokal mishap against Leipzig. Frankfurt's strong form in this year's UEL have them entering this match in third place in the table. A win here will surely prove sufficient to clinch a place in the Europa League knockouts in the coming calendar year. Lyon are nevertheless no slouches themselves in this competition, in seventh place after beating Olympiakos, Glasgow Rangers, and Qarabag Agdam. Pierre Sage's Lyon have only lost once in their last nine fixtures on-the-spin, merely dropping a UEL group stage match against Besiktas in late October. In their most recent meeting with a Bundesliga side, L'OL created plenty of headaches for Pellegrino Matarazzo's Hoffenheim in a 2-2 draw in early November. The round four Europa League fixture would prove to Matarazzo's penultimate match in charge. Several of Frankfurt's French star players prepare to return to their home turf. Hugo Ekitiké, Niels Nkounkou, Ellyes Skhiri, and Jean-Matteo Bahoya could all feature in the starting XI. Lyon-born Fares Chaibi - after struggling with form issues earlier this year - has been gaining more trust and playing time under Toppmöller as of late.  Ekitiké - whilst representing Stade Reims in December of 2021 - scored a dramatic late winner against Lyon in the Parc Olympique Lyonnais. Toppmöller made certain to bring this factoid up at his Wednesday pre-match press conference, noting that it would ""make for a nice story"" if the 22-year-old could replicate the feat.  Click here to see our predicted lineups. ",

Despite the high goals, many of the games were close run affairs and with them came a lot of talking points. These are your talking points and recap from matchday 13 in the Bundesliga.  Bayern Munich overcame FC Heidenheim 4-2 to extend their lead at the top of the table to six points. Though it seems like another standard Bayern victory, all is not how it sounds.  Bayern rested Jamal Musiala from their midweek duel with Bayer Leverkusen in the cup and it clearly showed that there was a creative spark missing from the first half.  After Dayot Upamecano gave Bayern the lead but then the Frenchman gifted the visitors their equaliser in the second half.  Enter Jamal Musiala. The 21-year-old made an immediate impact giving Bayern the lead. Leon Goretzka would then make it 3-1, before former Bayern player Niklas Dorsch provided a brief scare. Musiala would then make it 4-2. This result showed that no matter how strong the opponent is, Bayern struggle without Musiala. This is obviously not sustainable as shown earlier on this season when Bayern struggled against Eintracht Frankfurt, Aston Villa and Barcelona. The Friday night game between VfB Stuttgart and Union Berlin turned out to be a cracker and would set the tone for the rest of the matchday.  Union looked comfortable with two goals either side of half time to take a 0-2 lead after 50 minutes. However, a Nick Woltemade brace and a first Bundesliga goal from Atakan Karazor ensured a stunning comeback from the Swabians.  Union looked stunned following the equaliser and never really got going again. Having only conceded 11 goals prior to the game, the collapse was all the more surprising.  The winner for Stuttgart highlighted Union’s complete meltdown as goalkeeper Frederik Rønnow passed the ball to Karazor allowing him to finish with ease.  It’s a welcome win for Stuttgart and shows they still have that fighting spirit which has served them so well over the past 18 months. The win leaves them in 8th and just one point from 5th.  The Ralph Hasenhüttl renaissance is well and truly underway at VfL Wolfsburg. Their thrilling 4-3 victory over Mainz 05 sends them all the way into 5th and well within a shout for Europe next term.  With both sides on a five game unbeaten run going into this one, there was no wonder that forwards dominated the day.  Mainz went ahead early with a great move to set Paul Nebel away who finished into the far corner.  However, Wolfsburg found themselves level just six minutes later, Mohammed Amoura firing home after the keeper’s original stop. The goal was made by the brilliance of Tiago Tomás whose solo run near the touchline created the goal scoring chance in the first place.  Jonathan Burkardt then restored the visitor’s lead five minutes before the break and in doing so became the club’s joint all-time goalscorer in the Bundesliga.  Shortly after the break Amoura turned provided for Tomás whose deflected effort found its way into the net.  Back came Mainz once again with Nebel, which was his first top flight brace of his career and his third goal of the campaign.  Jonas Wind looked to at least salvage a point for Wolfsburg with seven minutes to go, but deep into stoppage time Wind went one better and headed home a freekick to ensure Wolfsburg took all three points.  Wolves unbeaten in six games now and inflict Mainz’s first away defeat since March.  RB Leipzig got back to winning ways with a comfortable 0-2 away victory at Holstein Kiel. Though the hosts had more of the ball and shots, they never really threatened Péter Gulácsi in the Saxon’s goal. The win keeps Leipzig in 4th.  Borussia Dortmund have now failed to win an away game from their opening five away fixtures having draw 1-1 in Mönchengladbach. In fact, BVB have taken just one point from a possible 15 from away fixtures so far. The only positive was that Jamie Gittens found the net again and continues to impress.  Eintracht Frankfurt were held to a 2-2 draw at home to a stubborn FC Augsburg side. A quiet day for Frankfurt’s forward despite the team dominating the ball for most of the game. Perhaps the draw is a little reminder that though Frankfurt are a fun watch, they’re the youngest team in the league and lacked experience when it comes to these types of games.  Elsewhere, there were wins for Werder Bremen at still winless Bochum (0-1), Bayer Leverkusen beat St. Pauli (2-1) and SC Freiburg played out a 1-1 draw with TSG Hoffenheim.  GGFN | Jamie Allen  @2023 - All Rights Reserved.

However, this was not the case. After Dayot Upamecano gave Bayern the lead but then the Frenchman gifted the visitors their equaliser in the second half.  Enter Jamal Musiala. The 21-year-old made an immediate impact giving Bayern the lead. Leon Goretzka would then make it 3-1, before former Bayern player Niklas Dorsch provided a brief scare. Musiala would then make it 4-2. This result showed that no matter how strong the opponent is, Bayern struggle without Musiala. This is obviously not sustainable as shown earlier on this season when Bayern struggled against Eintracht Frankfurt, Aston Villa and Barcelona.  It is entirely feasible to say that without the impact of Musiala, Bayern would only have a small margin of a lead on the likes of Frankfurt and Leverkusen, or even in the pack of teams below them in the table.    After their disastrous result last weekend, Leipzig bounced back in midweek with a convincing win against Frankfurt while this weekend they beat Holstien Kiel. Granted, it is Kiel, but a win is a win and it helps Leipzig move in the right direction as they look to end the year on a high and two tough games against Frankfurt and Bayern on the horizon to round of the year.  The big positive for Leipzig is the fact that Benjamin Seško is finally finding his scoring boots once again. His goal in the North of Germany was not as impressive as his goal in midweek as Kiel keeper Timon Weiner saved his initial shot but he would score the rebound. The lesser spotted André Silva would then make it 2-0 for Leipzig from the penalty spot. Another positive is the slow introduction of Xaver Schlager. On his day, the midfielder is key to how Leipzig play when they are at their best and he has slowly been building his match fitness as he returns from a ACL injury. It is possible that he could make his first start back against Bayern.   Frankfurt have been one of the early-season contenders in the Bundesliga this season and has at times looked unstoppable, today should have been one of those days as well, but they struggled to make use of their dominance.  A quiet day for Omar Marmoush but strike partner Hugo Ekitiké gave die Adler the lead, however, Augsburg would score two in 11 minutes with the second being gifted by Kevin Trapp. Can Uzun scored a well-taken effort to equalise for Frankfurt. The draw means Frankfurt are now six points behind Bayern, but no one ever thought they could truly challenge for the title.  This type of result shows Frankfurt’s lack of experience. They are the youngest team in the league, and teams that compete at the top usually find a way to win, whether they deserve it or not, and Frankfurt were unable to do this today. Die Adler will have to pick themselves up and go again next weekend as they face Leipzig.  GGFN | Jack Meenan @2023 - All Rights Reserved. Get Football Group",

Frank Schmidt's 1. FC Heidenheim rolled into the Allianz Arena and did score two goals against the record champs. Bayern nevertheless now have a six-point-lead in first place courtesy of the fact that Frankfurt could only draw against visiting Augsburg in a concurrent kickoff.  Kompany went with four straightforward and expected changes to the side that lined up against Leverkusen in the Pokal.Aleksandar Pavlovic and Sacha Boey returned to the starting XI over Leon Goretzka and Konrad Laimer. Thomas Müller spearheaded the attack while Jamal Musiala was sacrificed. As Kompany has already announced, keeper Daniel Peretz was handed his league debut in net for the injured Manuel Neuer.  Schmidt chose to employ four changes as well, building a 3-5-2 led by Bayern loanee Paul Wanner and Austrian attacking midfielder Mathias Honsak. This was accomplished by replacing Marnon Busch, Mikkel Kaufmann, Leonardo Scienza, and Niklas Dorsch with Honsak, Omar Haktab Traoré, Tim Siersleben, and Luca Kerber. Heidenheim lined up very differently than they did in the recent league loss to Frankfurt. The record champs had little trouble settling in around the Heidenheim penalty area, firing early warning shots via Müller and Leroy Sané in the opening quarter-of-an-hour. Space around the box remained tight, however. It took a set-piece for Bayern to take the lead in the 18th. Dayot Upamecano headed home a Joshua Kimmich corner for the 1-0.  The traffic effectively moved in only one direction for the duration of the first half. Bayern exhibited a strong possessional and passing game, producing more scoring chances from Davies (39th) and Müller (40th). Davies struck the post on the former effort. At the end of the opening 45, however, Bayern were still only up 1-0 despite lording over 86 percent possession.  Little of what transpired after the restart suggested that anything about the match would be different. At least that was the case until goal-scorer Upamecano's weak back-pass to Peretz was picked up by the lurking Honsak. The new FCH starter happily accepted the gift, easily beating the FCB keeper one-on-one and sending the 50th-minute 1-1 into the back of the net.  Parity would not last long. Just five minutes after being introduced as a substitute, Musiala restored the lead in the 56th. The German phenom's goal came off a relatively simple play. Musiala simply ran towards the box and had a go. The sharp effort sailed through defender Siersleben's legs and past FCH keeper Kevin Müller.  Everything appeared settled when the snake-bit Siersleben deflected in another goal in the 84th. Leon Goretzka was credited with the 3-1. Shockingly enough, FCH sub Dorsch scored for Heidenheim one minute later thanks to some poor marking from Bayern in the box. This would only delay the conclusion. Musiala proved faster than the totally rattled Siersleben at 90+1, scoring the decisve 4-2. Elsewhere in the Bundesliga's 15:30 kickoffs: Dino Toppmöller's SGE found it consistently difficult to break down the FCA park over at Deutsche Bank Park. Eintracht attacker Ansgar Knauff furnished a pair of scoring chances in the first half, but that was about it from the league's second-placed side. The German Eagles played much more energized football after the restart, finally taking the lead via Hugo Ekitiké in the 56th. This came after Ekitiké lived up to his recent reputation of being slightly too fancy with some wasted efforts early in the second 45.  The game was then shockingly turned on its head when two errors from Frankfurt keeper Kevin Trapp enabled that Bavarian Swabians to score two unanswered. Trapp allowed FCA striker Philipp Tietz to nutmeg him on the 1-1 in the 60th, then cut a horrible figure attempting to hold onto a Kristijian Jakic effort in the 71st. Tietz's attacking partner Samuel Essende capitalized on Trapp's error to score the 2-1. The hosts would then draw level in the 74th when SGE sub Can Uzun's effort deflected in off Tietz.  Frankfurt unfortunately couldn't break the deadlock.  Xabi Alonso's defending champs had little difficulty getting off to a cracking start against visiting St. Pauli at the BayArena. Goals from Florian Wirtz and Jonathan Tah in the opening 20 minutes ensured that the defending champs secured a commanding early lead. The half-time advantage might have been even greater were it not for a disallowed Nathan Tella (starting as the lead-striker as projected) goal in the 41st. Leverkusen dominance still couldn't produce a third goal in the second half, however.  Matters got very interesting toward the end when St. Pauli's Morgan Guilavogui pulled a goal back. The Kiezkicker came agonizingly close to scoring an equalizer in the tense final moments of the game, but weren't able to alter the final scoreline. Leverkusen's seventh league win of the season ensures a respectable 26 points total through 13 rounds. The 2023/24 Bundesliga title-holders are still seven points behind Bayern thanks to their five draws thus far this season.  Over ""anne Castroper"" last-placed VfL Bochum found rather out that their desired ""Dieter Hecking"" anti-Bremen magicwould not be materializing. The visiting Hanseaten completely outplayed their Westphalian hosts over the course of the initial 20 minutes. While the Reverklub created some interesting scoring chances later in the first-half, the lack of finishing quality in the squad continuously prevented Bochum from finding the back of the net. Eventually. Hecking's side were made to pay for their inability to score.  Jens Stage scored off a corner in the 56th to give the guests the lead. Bremen produced the better chances down the stretch as the Bochum crowd at the Vonovia Ruhrstadion grew uncharacteristically quiet. The match ended with Bremen remaining undefeated in 11 visits to the Ruhrpott town. Now winless in 15 league fixtures, Bochum have equalled their worst ever historic streak. The Bundesliga's last-placed side possess just two points this year from two draws.  Marco Rose's German Red Bulls were, not unexpectedly, able to dominate Marcel Rapp's Storks in their trip up north to Schleswig Holstein. RB striker Benjamin Sesko - just as he did in Wednesday's Pokal fixture - showcased his strong dribbling skills on the 27th-minute 1-0. Further offensive fireworks were nevertheless lacking and the Saxon guests never really managed to threaten to score a second goal. Rapp's Kiel were gradually working their way back into the game until a controversial penalty enabled Leipzig to make it 2-0 from the spot.  Loïs Openda seemed to go down rather easily Kiel defender Mavin Schulz grazed his arm in the 67th. Match official Florian Badstübner wasn't interested in the protests from the home side and VAR did not intervene in the scene. RB substitute Andre Silva converted the 2-0 in the 69th. A modest amount of Kiel fight-back quickly fizzled out. Unfortunately for the league's second-to-last-placed side, the controversy ended up serving as the match's last word.  ",

Just four points below league-leaders FC Bayern München, many consider Eintracht to be genuine title-race contenders at this stage in the season. The RheinMainAdler will need to affirm that status here.  Team news: Toppmöller revealed most of his squad plans at his Friday pre-match presser. Defender Arthur Theate should start, but it remains to be seen if the Belgian will work as a left back or will be needed in central defense to deputize for the questionable Robin Koch. It's reasonable to expect that Mahmoud Dahoud (for the injured Hugo Larsson) and Ansgar Knauff (for the ineffective Mario Götze) will move into the XI.  Jess Thorup's Augsburg come in fresh off a 120 minute Wednesday Pokal marathon against the Karlsruhe SC. A 1-0 win over Bochum in the league last weekend gave them their first Bundesliga win since upsetting Dortmund on match-day eight. The Fuggerstädter have had problems getting into gear early this season. Ruben Vargas (against Frankfurt on match-day 30 last year) was the last player to score a league goal in the opening 15 minutes.  Team news: Speaking at his Friday press conference, Thorup said that - in a team talk - all of the players who featured against Karlsruhe on Wednesday ""want to be back on the pitch"" rather than rotated out. Greek wingback Dimitrios Giannoulis might be ready to return to the starting XI after bowing out with injury against Bayern two weeks ago. Keven Schlotterbeck returns from his one-match league suspension and will probably take over for Maximilian Bauer.  ",

This was made abundantly clear by SGE trainer Dino Toppmöller at his Friday pre-match presser.  ""We won't be doing that,"" Toppmöller flatly stated when asked whether or not he was considering changes in attack, ""both will be on the pitch tomorrow and will show us a reaction.""  Toppmöller will have to make at least one change to the XI he deployed against the German Red Bulls on Wednesday.Swedish midfielder Hugo Larsson remains out with the muscular issue he picked up in the cup loss. Mahmoud Dahoud counts as the most likely replacement, though Toppmöller also noted that the returning Oscar Højlund may soon be ready to fulfill the role that was initially intended for him. Højlund's Danish compatriot Rasmus Kristensen - also returning from injury - incurred massive criticism for his work as a makeshift left-back in the RB loss. This unnatural deployment was rendered necessary by Arthur Theate's injury.Toppmöller noted that Theate would be ready for the forthcoming league match.  “He completed training today and will be able to play tomorrow,” Toppmöller said, ”Arthur is a dream for every coach in terms of his mentality and willingness to serve the team.” “He signaled straight away that he would be on the pitch on Saturday, no matter what,” Toppmöller said. “He'll get a good taping up and a painkiller. Then he'll be able to play.” ",

Wanner has spent the past two years on loan at Elversberg and now Heidenheim, at the latter he is getting European experience in the UEFA Conference League.  If Frankfurt qualify for the Champions League, then Wanner could move to the side to gain even more experience and return to the Allianz Arena as a more mature player. Wanner would fit right into the type of squad that Frankfurt are building. Die Adler have one of the youngest squads in the Bundesliga and could be seen as a natural successor to Mario Götze in the squad.  This type of move would indicate that Bayern see Wanner as a part of their future but things could change if the Rekordmeister step up their pursuit for Florian Wirtz. As not only do Wirtz and Wanner play in the same position, but it has previously been reported that Wanner could be used as a makeweight in a move for the Leverkusen star.  GGFN | Jack Meenan    @2023 - All Rights Reserved.

The hosts looked nervous in the opening stages, as Nicolas Seiwald's tame free-kick and Willi Orban's header failed to beat Kevin Trapp. However, they took the lead through Benjamin Sesko's sublime run and finish in the box after good early work from Antonio Nusa in the 31st minute.

In the 17th minute, Willi Orban headed the ball in the direction of Frankfurt's goal and he forced a good save from Kevin Trapp. Around the half hour mark, Eintracht stepped up and provided a bit more attacking wise especially with their accumulation of corners. However, minutes later, Leipzig opened the scoring thanks to Benjamin Sesko who finished past Trapp into the corner of the goal. Just before half time, Frankfurt had a chance as Nnamdi Collins brought the ball into the box and Robin Koch weakly puts the ball towards goal. After half time, Leipzig once again piled on the pressure as they forced an error from Frankfurt's defence whilst they were playing out from the back. This time, it was Loïs Openda who capitalized to make it 2-0 for the east German side as he took the ball first time into the corner of the net in benefiting from a mistake. Just under ten minutes later, Openda bagged his brace as he smashes the ball from nineteen metres from the goal into the back of the net. This goal was provided by Antonio Nusa, who has three assists during this point in the game already. During the 67th minute, Leipzig had a chance to counter and score as Openda tried to pull into a central area and net his hat-trick but was unsuccessful. Further Eintracht Frankfurt changes in bringing on Mahmoud Dahoud and Oscar Hojlund did little to change the game around. The aforementioned Dahoud, however, did earn himself a yellow card late on as he fouled Xaver Schlager in one of the last noteworthy actions of the game.  In winning this tie, Leipzig have ended a six-match run of games without a win.",

The German youth international is in the final year of his contract with the Sinsheim club and it’s unlikely that a new contract will be signed, meaning Bischof is free to leave the club at the end of the season, but TSG want a final decision before the end of the year. Borussia Dortmund are also working on the contract extension of sporting director Sebastian Kehl, which could be finalised before Christmas, and the 44-year-old, who is responsible for transfers at Die Schwarzgelben has also identified Bischof as a target. Bischof has featured in 10 Bundesliga games for Hoffenheim this season, starting TSG’s last nine successive league games, scoring one and creating one. The central-midfielder is regarded as one of the brightest prospects in German football and, per Transfermarkt, the 19-year-old has a market value of €3.5m.

However, this season has marked a major shift in form from last season for both clubs.  Eintracht Frankfurt, who were inconsistent last season, have started this season in brilliant fashion and have only lost twice in the Bundesliga. Contrasting this, Leipzig started strongly too but have since fallen off and are without a win this season in the Champions League and have not won since October in the Bundesliga.  Last time out, it was Wolfsburg who put five past Marco Rose's side on the weekend to pile the pressure on the coach ahead of this tough test against one of the Bundesliga's biggest surprise packages. Keeping goals out will no doubt be a big issue for Leipzig as they will have to deal with Frankfurt's Omar Marmoush who has thirteen goals in fourteen in the Bundesliga. However, in the cup, Eintracht's Hugo Ekitike is currently the top scorer with three goals and he has scored in both of their last games against Borussia Mönchengladbach and Eintracht Braunschweig. Ahead of the game, Frankfurt's coach Dino Toppmöller said: “It'll be a difficult game, but we're in good form. When you look at Leipzig's situation, it is understandable that things aren't going too well because of the injuries they have.” Leipzig coach Marco Rose commented on his team's pre-match preparations ahead of the game too when he said: “We are working hard ahead of the cup game to experience that winning feeling again.” Eintracht Frankfurt are without Aurele Amenda and Arthur Theate due to injury. Castello Lukeba, Xavi Simons, Yussuf Poulsen, Eljif Elmas, Assan Ouédrago, David Raum, Lukas Klostermann and El Chadaille Bitshiabu are all out with injury for RB Leipzig. RB Leipzig: Gulacsi - Henrichs, Seiwald, Orban, Geertruida - Baumgartner, Vermeeren, Kampl, Nusa - Sesko, Openda Eintracht Frankfurt: Trapp - Collins, Tuta, Koch, Nkounkou - Götze, Skhiri, Larsson, Knauff- Marmoush, Ekitike",

Speaking at a press conference ahead of Eintracht's DFB-Pokal clash with RB Leipzig on Wednesday, head coach Dino Toppmöller revealed that the Belgian defender picked up an injury during the game. ""He injured his ankle a quarter of an hour before the end of the game on Sunday. He has a torn collateral ligament,"" Toppmöller told reporters. Toppmöller doesn't expect Theate to be out for long, however, and wouldn't rule out the possibility of the defender playing against Augsburg on Saturday. “He fought through and played until the end, which shows his mentality. He is now suspended for the cup, and then we'll have to assess him again on Friday before Saturday's game.” Apart from Theate and the injured Aurele Amenda, Toppmöller will have a full squad at his disposal for the upcoming game again RB Leipzig. ""It still looks very, very good,"" he noted.",

Obviously, he hasn't had a lot of experience in senior football, so he would have learnt a lot today,"" Postecoglou said. ""The red card, it was a bit of overenthusiasm at that moment to give away a foul, but he'll learn from that. The same with Lucas. Giving him an understanding of the levels here. ""It is not easy when you are playing away in Europe. You can only allow them to learn that by exposing them to it. ""I thought Archie was great.

However, he became the third-youngest player to both score and be sent off in a Europa League game after Aleksandar Mitrovic for Partizan Belgrade in November 2012 (18-years-old and 67 days) and Federico Chiesa for Fiorentina in December 2016 (19-years-old and 44 days). Despite the scoreline, Spurs were comfortably second-best against Galatasaray as they suffered their first defeat in the competition this season.  They faced 28 shots from their opponents, their most in a game under Postecoglou.  It was also the most efforts faced by an English team in a Europa League group stage match since Everton faced 39 shots against Wolfsburg in November 2014.   And Postecoglou believes his side only had themselves to blame for the defeat, citing a number of mistakes as their undoing in Turkey.  ""I just felt it was self-inflicted. We had real simple solutions out there to keep the ball. It wasn't that hard. We showed it with 10 men,"" Postecoglou added. ""We just needed to be stronger on the ball and play the kind of football we play every week.

They have won all three of their previous games in the Europa League but Galatasaray could prove to be a fresh challenge for the London giants.  Okan Buruk‘s Gala have been very impressive so far this season. They remain unbeaten in the Turkish Süper Lig, they’ve tasted victory over José Mourinho’s Fenerbahçe, all while scoring the most goals and  conceding just nine times in 10 games.   In fact, the last time they lost was against Young Boys in the UEFA Champions League qualifiers and it has been smooth sailing since then, with their most recent game yielding a 2-1 win over fierce rivals Beşiktaş. The side’s setup focuses on pressing high up the pitch and playing through the lines quickly and while Buruk has used a 4-2-3-1 setup, he used a flat 4-2-2-2 shape against Beşiktaş, which suggests that he isn’t averse to adapting.  Spurs fans will be familiar with at least a couple of faces during the game against Gala, both of whom have history with Tottenham.   Former defender Davinson Sánchez has been a key performer in the season so far, as he scored against Beşiktaş at the weekend. Ex-Arsenal man Lucas Torreira has also shown some consistency, as he comes up against the Lilywhites years after scoring a winning goal against them during Spurs’ Mauricio Pochettino-era. The man to be scared of though, is Victor Osimhen. The Napoli loanee is arguably one of the best strikers in the world and like Sánchez, he had also scored against Beşiktaş. So far in the campaign, he has four goals across all competitions while fellow marksman Mauro Icardi has just as many. It is Osimhen who is expected to start for Gala and both Torreira and Sánchez will also feature. Only Ismail Jakobs is absent for Buruk’s side and keeper Fernando Muslera is back in contention.  The last week has seen Postecoglou rotate his side, as James Maddison only came off the bench against Aston Villa and Mikey Moore remained on the sidelines for the weekend clash against Villa. Heung Min-Son and Timo Werner also rotated and it suggests that Tottenham will likely make chan get to keep their side fresh for Thursday. Cristian Romero picked up an injury at the weekend, days after Micky van de Ven was also injured in mid-week, meaning that Ben Davies will start alongside Radu Drăgușin.

 Manchester City slumped to an eighth defeat in 11 games in all competitions against Manchester United, continuing the club's worst run of form since 2006; Pep Guardiola: ""I'm the manager and I'm not good enough, simple as that"" Sunday 15 December 2024 22:24, UK Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Pep Guardiola said he is ""not good enough"" to solve Manchester City's mounting problems after two late Manchester United goals consigned them to a dramatic 2-1 derby loss. City unravelled in spectacular fashion at the Etihad Stadium as Amad Diallo struck a 90th-minute winner for the visitors just moments after Bruno Fernandes had levelled from the penalty spot. The game-changing penalty was conceded by makeshift left-back Matheus Nunes after his poor back-pass put Ederson in trouble, but Guardiola took responsibility as he reflected on an unprecedented eighth defeat in 11 games afterwards. ""I'm the boss, I'm the manager, I have to find solutions but I don't find solutions,"" he said in his press conference. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""This is a big club and when you lose eight [out of 11 games] something is wrong. You can say the schedule is tough or the injuries to players, but no. ""I'm the manager and I'm not good enough, simple as that. I have to find a way to talk to them, to train them in the way we need to play, to press the way we need to press. ""I'm not good enough. I'm not doing well. That is the truth.""

             Guardiola signed a new two-year contract in November, saying he did not feel he could leave the club at a difficult time, but the crisis has spiralled since then and he is now facing questions over how and when he can reverse their fortunes. ""I'm here,"" he said. ""I'm responsible. It would be easy for me to say we lost because of this action or this player or this situation but football is a team game. ""I'm completely convinced in what I'm saying, that I'm not good enough to find a way for them to feel peace in their bodies and their minds. I want it desperately. I'm here to try and I will try again and again but that is the reality."" Guardiola added: ""I knew it would be a tough season but I didn't expect so hard."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Speaking to Sky Sports, Guardiola said: ""This year, I would say many times this has unfortunately happened. We give away many things against Feyenoord and in games this season and at this level, it's more difficult. ""We are not, I would say, nice in the way we play. Before it was so fluid and now we struggle for different reasons - of course for a lot of defeats - but we put everything in, the game was almost closed except one chance for Bruno Fernandes. ""OK, they were a little better, more possession in the first half, but nothing special. But at the end, we give away the two goals and it's more difficult."" ""It is what it is, what can I say? It is not about this action of a player, or that, it is a tough season and it will be a tough season. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""We did not play at our best today because in some positions we are not at our best, we struggled, but it is what it is. ""Now we do not play for many things, but especially for the momentum that we have. ""We obviously need results to lift our mood, but it is getting worse and worse and the reality is it is like this. I am the manager of this club and I have to find a solution. And so far, I did not find it. This is the truth."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Manchester City midfielder Bernardo Silva pulled no punches on their performance in the closing stages, slamming their ""stupid mistakes"" and insisting they got what they deserved. ""At this level, if it's a game or two, you can say that they are being lucky,"" he told Sky Sports. ""If it's 10 games, it's not about that. ""If in the 87th minute of a derby, you are winning 1-0 with a corner for your team and the ball ends up with your 'keeper and a penalty for them, my friend… ""If you make these kinds of stupid decisions with three or four minutes to go, you deserve to pay for that. ""If you look at the game, there was only one team that could win. But in the end, we lost, and it's not one game, it's a lot of games lately. ""We have to look at ourselves. It's not about luck. It's the decisions you make. Today, in the last minutes we played like Under-15s and we paid the price."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Speaking on the Gary Neville Podcast, Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville said Guardiola is facing a rebuild and that some of his players have reached the end of the road at the club. ""This is not a time for anybody with knowledge of the game to stick the knife into Manchester City or Pep Guardiola. This is a time to recognise that these players have run a million miles together over many, many years, and they've just hit a wall. ""They've hit a wall with their manager all at once. It happened at United in a number of seasons over a 20-year period where we didn't win for one or two seasons. Pep Guardiola's only ever had one season without the title. This may be another one here. ""These are serial winners and this is one of the greatest managers of all time. They've played unbelievably consistently, been reliable, everything you'd want in a football team, and these players have delivered. They will always be winners. ""But they've all come to a point in their journey together whereby something needs to change, and they need a rest. I thought it would come last year. I thought after the treble there would be a dip. Not a dip in their will to win, you just cannot keep going. ""You need to somehow have a break. They're playing in Champions League games, they're playing in FA Cup finals, Carabao Cup finals, winning leagues. They've played for their countries every summer and they've just come to the end of that journey as a group. ""One or two of them may have to leave, three or four will have to come in, and you'll see a different Manchester City through those changes. It's not a massive rebuild, it's just getting the players fit, and getting that sort of adaptation to the squad. ""This is a time to say well done for what you've achieved over the last few years, because this is not them. They've proven that to us over a period of four, five, six seasons.""

 Report and match highlights as a Bruno Fernandes penalty and Amad Diallo strike clinch a remarkable 2-1 win for Man Utd over Man City in the Premier League; Pep Guardiola's side led until the 88th-minute courtesy of Josko Gvardiol's header but collapsed in the closing stages 
          Comment and Analysis
              @nicholaspwright
 Sunday 15 December 2024 21:55, UK Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Manchester United staged a stunning comeback at the Etihad Stadium as Amad Diallo's last-minute goal clinched a 2-1 win over crisis-hit Manchester City. Ruben Amorim's side were trailing to Josko Gvardiol's first-half header until the 88th minute, when a tepid derby exploded into life as Matheus Nunes fouled Amad, following a poor backpass, to concede a penalty which was converted by Bruno Fernandes. Moments later, the excellent Amad was put through on goal from Lisandro Martinez's ball over the top, touching it around Ederson before steering a superb finish into the net from an acute angle to leave the home supporters in stunned silence. Man City: Ederson (6), Dias (5), Walker (5), Gvardiol (7), Nunes (4), Silva (6), De Bruyne (6), Gundogan (6), Foden (7), Doku (6), Haaland (5).


Subs: Kovacic (6), Grealish (6), Savinho (n/a).


Man Utd: Onana (7), De Ligt (7), Maguire (7), Martinez (7), Mazraoui (7), Ugarte (7), Fernandes (8), Dalot (7), Amad (9), Mount (6), Hojlund (6).


Subs: Mainoo (7), Zirkzee (6), Antony (6), Yoro (6), Lindelof (n/a).


Player of the Match: Amad Diallo
 The result deepens the crisis facing Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola, whose side have only won one of their last 11 games in all competitions, continuing the club's worst run of form since 2006. For Manchester United, the victory, only their second in the Premier League under Amorim, came after two huge calls by the new boss, who left forwards Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho out of his squad, citing selection reasons. Asked about Ruben Amorim's omissions of Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho ahead of the game, Sky Sports pundit Roy Keane said: ""He has obviously seen something he doesn't like.


""But for those who have watched Manchester United recently, it's not a big surprise because both players have been poor.


""He has said 'enough is enough'. It's a big call, but I like to see it. He has put down a marker."" 


Speaking before the game, Amorim revealed Rashford and Garnacho were made to train on Sunday morning. Their absences saw Amad pushed into a more advanced role and he duly punished the out-of-sorts hosts for failing to add to Gvardiol's opener, which was headed home from Kevin De Bruyne's deflected cross from one of few chances in the first half. It appeared Guardiola's side were going to stumble over the line to victory when Fernandes dinked a one-on-one chance wide after Amad had seen a flicked header pushed around the post by Ederson in the second period, but City's latest implosion allowed United to celebrate a remarkable victory.

             The champions are left in fifth place, behind Nottingham Forest in fourth, and nine points off leaders Liverpool, who have a game in hand.

They were in the game for 90 minutes and that is really important. I think we deserved this win. It was a good day for us. ""You could feel we were near to scoring.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""When we scored the first one, you could feel it. They wanted it more. Congratulations to the players. We needed it a lot."" On Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho, Amorim added: ""It was nothing special. New week, new life. If they train well, they will compete for a place in the team, if they are better than the other guys in all the situations, inside and outside the pitch. ""They are really talented and we need Garna and Rash a lot. It was not a disciplinary thing. It's just that we have to improve our standards. They will get used to this."" A distraught Mason Mount suffered another injury setback as he limped off after only 12 minutes at the Etihad Stadium.


Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim told Sky Sports: ""He stretched his leg and felt something. It was bad luck. We are going to recover him because we need him.


""He really fits our style because he’s a very good player. Also, outside the pitch he is the kind of character I want in this team."" Bruno Fernandes hailed Manchester United match-winner Amad Diallo, telling Sky Sports: ""He has been doing great things and there's a lot more to come. ""He's always active, always alive and this is why he gets the penalty and his goal. He's been brilliant but I shouldn't say much as we need to keep him going as we need him at this level. ""Like this, he is unstoppable. ""I'm pretty sure he can do this every week. We expect it. He knows the expectation when playing for Manchester United. He's getting his chance deservedly.

Hojlund took to social media to taunt Walker aftewards, writing on Instagram: ""Manchester is red, violets are blue, what a brilliant performance, but the Oscar goes to..."" Bernardo Silva did not hold back on Manchester City's collapse, telling Sky Sports: ""We totally deserved what happened. ""At this level, if it's a game or two, you can say that they are being lucky. If it's 10 games, it's not about that. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""If in the 87th minute of a derby, you are winning 1-0 with a corner for your team and the ball ends up with your 'keeper and a penalty for them, my friend… ""If you make these kinds of stupid decisions with three or four minutes to go, you deserve to pay for that. ""If you look at the game, there was only one team that could win. But in the end, we lost, and it's not one game, it's a lot of games lately. ""We have to look at ourselves. It's not about luck. It's the decisions you make. Today, in the last minutes we played like under-15s and we paid the price."" Man City boss Pep Guardiola told Sky Sports: ""This year it happens many times unfortunately. We gave away many things. We are not nice in the way we played. Before it was so fluid, now we're struggling for different reasons. A lot of defeats. ""We put everything in and the game was almost closed. They had more possession first half but nothing special. We give away two goals, very difficult. ""It is what it is. What can I say? We can not blame this player or that one, it's not that. It's the season, a tough season. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""We didn't play our best. We are not our best and we struggle a bit. Now we don't play for the week. ""Previously we didn't lose that many in two seasons. Now we've done it in eight games. You have to defend. We have lost a lot of games. It's difficult. We have to move on and try to find the solution and try to win games. ""I think in nine years it wasn't the toughest defeat. Champions League defeats were harder. But at the moment, we need results to lift our mood. It's getting worse and worse. I have to find the solution. So far I didn't find it and this is the truth.""

 Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim: ""I pay attention to everything, the way you eat, the way you put your clothes to go to a game. Everything. I make my evaluation and then I decide""; Speaking on his podcast Gary Neville backed Amorim's decision to drop the pair 
@Ben_Islington
 Sunday 15 December 2024 22:57, UK Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim says he dropped Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho for the Manchester derby due to ""selection"" reasons rather than injury or illness. The forwards were omitted from United's 20-player matchday squad for their 2-1 victory over Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium. Rashford played 56 minutes of Thursday's 2-1 Europa League comeback win against Viktoria Plzen while Garnacho was introduced as an 81st-minute substitute. But rather than feature against neighbours City in the Premier League, the pair instead trained at the team's training ground on Sunday morning. Asked to explain the decision to omit Rashford and Garnacho, United boss Amorim told Sky Sports: ""Selection. ""We try to evaluate everything - training, performance, game performance, engagement with the teammates, push the teammates up. ""Everything is on the line when we analyse and try to choose the players, so it was my selection. Simple.

             ""I don't want to send a message (to the dressing room with this). It's simply an evaluation, and they know it. ""The players are really, really smart and so everybody understands my decision and I have to choose. It's just a simple selection. ""Of course the context is difficult - we have to win games and we have a difficult situation now. ""But, like I said, I pay attention to everything - the way you eat, the way you put on your clothes to go the game. Everything. ""I make my evaluation and then I have to decide. I have a lot of players to choose (from) and today I did my choice."" A United source told the PA news agency that Garnacho's absence has nothing do with allegations about team leaks, but his absence along with that of Rashford provides more questions than answers. ""It's the same all the time and they all understand,"" Amorim said of how the pair found out. ""There's a communication that after the last training is going to the WhatsApp, and then they receive the information. But they are alright, they had training this morning. ""I was there because it's important for every player… even Jonny Evans because Jonny Evans also (trained) and Toby (Collyer) was there and everything was OK. They trained really well."" Following United's victory, Amorim added: ""It was nothing special. New week, new life. If they train well, they will compete for a place in the team, if they are better than the other guys in all the situations, inside and outside the pitch. ""They are really talented and we need Garna and Rash a lot. It was not a disciplinary thing. It's just that we have to improve our standards. They will get used to this."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Sky Sports' Gary Neville speaking on The Gary Neville Podcast: ""They've both been poor on the pitch. That's a fact. And Amorim said the selection issue was down to performance and performance and engagement with teammates. That means if they've not been good in the group. That's why they weren't here. ""What he's done is made a bold call. ""What he has to do is shake this club to its core. I'm a United fan tonight, and I've got a smile on my face because something's happened that I never expected. ""I had no faith or trust in these players to come here today and win, even as bad as City are. Subscribe to the Gary Neville Podcast now on: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Spreaker ""But Amorim has to make even more bold decisions, because there are a lot of players in that squad who are not good enough to get Amorim where he wants to be and keep him in a job. ""Don't think for one second over the next few years that the players that have won you this game today are going to be able to win you games and get you to where you need to be to keep you in a job, because the others in the past have been conned by finishing second, winning a FA Cup, and they've lost their jobs eventually. ""What he needs to do is get a group of players who can fit with his idea. We know his idea, we've seen that now. It's the 3-4-3, he plays the two narrow off the striker, he plays the two in midfield sitting, and he plays the two wing-backs with the three at the back. ""He needs to make sure he's brutal with it, really brutal. And he's been brutal today. I mean, the easy thing to do would be to put them on the bench and not let the press ask questions. ""But he's taken the really difficult choice, which has paid off because he's won, and those two are sat at home. I think he'll double down now, and realise spirit, togetherness, team ethic is more important than anybody with talent. ""The reason that I stayed at that club for 19 years, and that John O'Shea stayed for a long time, and Nicky Butt, Wes Brown, Tom Cleverley, Darren Fletcher, was because of spirit. ""Honestly, you need everybody every day to run as hard as they possibly can and do everything that they can. That's what Manchester City have done for the last four or five years, with quality as well. But the work ethic has been poor from Garnacho and Rashford. ""We've watched them in those two wide positions for two, three seasons, not running back, thinking that they can play the game without putting the work in."" Sky Sports' Roy Keane said of Alejandro Garnacho and Marcus Rashford's omissions: ""It is a big call. ""He has obviously seen something he doesn't like. But for those who have watched Manchester United recently, it's not a big surprise because both players have been poor. He has said 'Enough is enough'. ""It's a big call, but I like to see it - he has put down a marker. A move for Marcus [Rashford] would suit the player - a new challenge for him. He's been there a long time. When you're at a big club and your attitude is not right - and it hasn't been great recently - sometimes it's good to part ways."" Micah Richards added: ""It's sad for a local boy in Rashford who is supposed to be the talisman for this team... to see the way his career has materialised over the last couple of years. ""We saw he had a couple of good seasons and thought now is the time for him to be the leader, and then now to not be involved in the derby you imagine he's heartbroken. ""There's a player in there but it can't help that the manager is always changing. It's a sad story for a player of that quality. ""It's different for Rashford. He's got the world on his shoulders. It seems to be like there's a bigger problem than just football."" Tom from Southampton became a millionaire for free with Super 6! Could you be the next jackpot winner? Play for free!

  Further refereeing controversy has emerged from the Premier Sports Cup final between Celtic and Rangers after outrage over a penalty call.
 
  Furious Philippe Clement was left bemused as his side were not awarded a spot-kick in extra time for a foul on Vaclav Cerny, which was deemed to be outside the box.
 
  Replays appear to show Cerny's foot on the line of the penalty area and therefore meaning a penalty should have been given - according to IFAB rules.

  However, no VAR review was called with John Beaton's decision to award a free-kick on the edge of the area allowed to stand.
 
  Now, it has emerged that there were two Celtic penalties during the shoot-out in which Kasper Schmeichel was inside the box before it was taken.
 
  The Danish keeper, 38, walked into the area as Arne Engels stepped up to take his spot-kick and earlier Schmeichel had been inside the box as Adam Idah stroked home the first penalty for Celtic.
 
  According the Laws of the Game, goalkeepers (of the takers) must be positioned outside the box and on the goal line when a penalty is being taken.

Raging Philippe Clement demands Rangers vs Celtic penalty answers
 
  The rules read: ""The goalkeeper of the kicker must remain on the field of play, outside the penalty area, on the goal line where it meets the penalty area boundary line.""
 
  For Idah's penalty, Schmeichel was stationary but inside the box - this would not constitute encroachment as he did not have a material outcome on the spot-kick which was scored.
 
  However, the Celtic goalkeeper should have been warned over his positioning by match officials.
 
  Then, Beaton should have halted Engels before he took his penalty with Schmeichel well inside the box. As it was a second infringement, Schmeichel should have been shown a yellow card.
 
  IFAB laws state: ""If the goalkeeper commits an offence and, as a result, the kick is retaken, the goalkeeper is warned for the first offence and cautioned for any subsequent offence(s).""
 
(Image: Premier Sports) Commenting on the incident, Behind The Whistles account posted: ""John should stop the penalty being taken and booked Kasper.""
 
  A second post added: ""Normal encroachment Laws would apply so his encroachment would have to have a material outcome on the kick.
 
  ""While he shouldn’t be there he’s not having a material impact so no disadvantage from his encroachment.
 
  ""But John Beaton should have told him after the first one to stay clear and when he did again he should have carded him.""

  ROBIN Propper tonight insisted the gulf in quality between Rangers and Celtic is not that large despite the Ibrox club losing the Premier Sports Cup final to their city rivals at Hampden.
 
  Propper felt that Philippe Clement’s side had competed well with Brendan Rodgers’ team during the dramatic encounter - which finished 3-3 at the end of the 120 minutes - even though they ended up being beaten 5-4 in a penalty shoot-out.
 
  And the Dutch centre half is confident the Govan outfit can record an elusive victory over the Parkhead outfit, who are 11 points clear of them in the William Hill Premiership, when they play them at home in the league at the start of January. 
 
  “Of course it was disappointing,” he said. “On the other hand, it was a really nice game to play. We had moments to lead, to win that game.
  “It felt, of course, really disappointing in the end. But I think we had some character today. We stayed positive as a team. We tried our best. In the end, you want to win. But I think if you see the whole game, we can be proud of ourselves.”
 
  Propper continued: “It's one game. And you want to win this game because then directly you have a cup and a medal. But in this game there was not that big of a gap. It's 3-3 and in the end it's a lottery and penalties. So, the gap today wasn't that big.
 
  “We want to show it every game. If that's possible, we try our best. Today, it was a 50-50 game. It's 3-3. We showed some character twice. We had moments we could win, overtake Celtic. We have that in our team. So, we have to be focused on that to show that every day.”
 
  Propper stressed that nobody in the Rangers dressing room had held Ridvan Yilmaz, who had his penalty saved by Celtic keeper Kasper Schmiechel in the shoot-out, responsible for the loss.
 
  “You know that this is part of the game,” he said. “It's a lottery in the end. He has to keep his head up and he will do that. It was the ultimate small margins when it comes down to penalty kicks.”

  Celtic’s League Cup final hero Daizen Maeda has revealed he miskicked his winning penalty against Rangers, with the winger relieved to see Jack Butland dive the wrong way after he had sclaffed his spot kick.
 
  Maeda has built a career on his boundless energy, but even he was struggling after an epic contest between the Old Firm rivals that went all the way to a penalty shootout. There was no damage done in the end though as his strike wrongfooted Butland and gave Celtic the first trophy of the season.
 
  The Japanese internationalist says the thought of winning the game for their supporters and for his children gave him the extra energy he needed to stagger over the line, and now he has set his sights on delivering a treble.
 
  “I think the celebration from the supporters shows you a lot and we had to win this game, so it was good to get the result,” Maeda said.
 
  “I wasn’t nervous at all. But because I was tired, and it was also a miskick, so it was a great goal. Because of [the mishit] the ball went the opposite side of the goalkeeper. So, it was a very good moment.
 
  “At this club you have to win, you can’t lose or draw. It’s league games, it’s cup games.
 
  “I’m very glad we’ve got the first title this year. Now we’re the only one who has the chance to win the treble, so yes [we can do it].
 
  “But right now we just enjoy the moment – and after we have a rest, and we will try to focus on the next game.”
 
  Maeda has often been seen warming down with his children after matches on the Celtic Park pitch, and he was delighted to put a smile on their faces once again.
 
  “Everything I achieve is for my children, especially my son as he now understands the football and he sees me playing and how I play,” he said.
 
  “I like to make him smile.”

  Redemption, thy name was so very nearly Philippe.
 
  But as it has been so often, it was Brendan Rodgers who - for the 10th time now over his two spells in charge of Celtic - was the manager holding the silverware at the end of a breathless contest at Hampden.
 
  There will likely be talk of the gap narrowing between Celtic and Rangers on the basis of this game, and of the protagonists and the villains of the piece, with some players filling both those roles throughout an incredibly captivating 120-plus minutes and penalties.
 
  Greg Taylor, for instance, went from zero to hero. Ridvan Yilmaz was the unfortunate man left, bereft, holding the can at the end as his penalty miss in the shootout was to prove the decisive factor in finally separating these two sides after an almighty slugfest at the national stadium.
 
  Long before that though, was a moment that could just as easily be ranked as a defining one in this contest, and when at least a couple of the fingers that Rangers looked to have on the League Cup trophy slipped off.
 
  The second half of a pulsating League Cup final had started as the first had ended – with Celtic rattled.
 
  Rangers had their rivals on the ropes alright. Celtic’s play had been uncharacteristically error-strewn in the opening period, and it appeared that Clement’s game of cat and mouse was about to pay off big time, with his side having already pounced on one catastrophic error to hit the front, and looking as though they would do so again to all but kill off the contest.
 
  It was the aforementioned Taylor who was badly at fault, as his loose square ball – one of many kamikaze passes Celtic seemed intent on attempting - was punished for Nedim Bajrami to put Rangers ahead. And when the same player was caught in possession once more after the restart, he must have feared the worst.
 
  A swarm of blue jerseys poured forward as the ball was worked to Hamza Igamane, who in turn fed Bajrami on the right. There were at least two, possibly even three Rangers players waiting to tap home in the middle.
 
  All that stood between Bajrami and his teammates – and perhaps Rangers and the trophy, given the way the contest had unfolded to that point – was Cameron Carter-Vickers. But somehow, the American managed to block Bajrami’s attempted centre, and in the blink of an eye, the final had been turned on its head.

Rangers manager fumes at VAR official for ‘really weird’ penalty snub
 
  Celtic equalised through a deflected effort from Taylor, of all people, and then hit the front through a typically opportunistic Daizen Maeda strike. And there were still innumerable twists and turns to come.
 
  Rangers hit back through Mohamed Diomande, before Celtic looked to have won it as Nicolas Kuhn tucked home an Arne Engels cutback with just three minutes of regulation time remaining. But barely 60 seconds later, the ball was in the net at the other end, as a delicious Vaclav Cerny cross was nodded home by Danilo.
 
  Given the torrents of water that passed under the bridge then since that moment when Carter-Vickers intercepted Bajrami’s cross for what would have been a certain Rangers goal, it may not stick out immediately as the defining point of this battle. But the context at the time meant that its significance cannot be overstated.
 
  If Rangers could be faulted for their quality of football at times here, they certainly couldn’t be faulted for their heart, commitment and endeavour, having picked themselves up off the canvas twice in the second half to force extra time.
 
  But when the moment came to administer that knockout punch, they just couldn’t do it. At 2-0 to Rangers, a dazed Celtic would have been all-but dead on their feet. But the punch was pulled, and then Celtic found their legs.
 
  The killer instinct, that ethereal quality that separates the winners from the losers, is still a missing component in the make-up of this Rangers team. Whatever it is, Celtic have it in spades, and that is what really separates these two sides.
 
  And so, Rodgers and his men, despite being knocked out of their stride and being far below their best, march merrily on. Celtic, as they did at this same venue against this same opponent in May, found a way to win.
 
  When the big moment arrived, they grasped it, with Maeda delivering the coup de grace that had eluded Rangers by slamming home the winning penalty.
 
  As for Clement, there is no denying that from the low point of that insipid Ibrox draw against Dundee United, remarkably just three weeks ago or so, he has slowly been working his way back into the favours of the Rangers support.
 
  They say that once the crowd turns, there is no way back for a manager. And cards on the table, I know this because I said as much myself about Clement the evening of that dire display against United.
 
  A win against Celtic here though, despite the gap between the sides in the league, would have underlined his recent good work, and then some.
 
  But as it stands, that win against Celtic is still beyond him - after this, his sixth attempt - with just one other draw to his name. Celtic have the League Cup. That gap in the table still stands at 11 points.
 
  Rangers may never have a better chance of giving this Celtic side a bloody nose. Clement may never have a better chance of besting Rodgers. But neither he nor his team could seize it, and therein lies the difference.

 Clement is yet to beat Celtic as Rangers manager after Sunday's League Cup final defeat at Hampden Park; Clement was angry they were not awarded a penalty in extra time Sunday 15 December 2024 21:46, UK Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Rangers manager Philippe Clement believes Rangers were denied a penalty before their '""cruel"" defeat to Celtic in the League Cup final. Celtic clinched the trophy courtesy of a tense penalty shoot-out after the teams drew 3-3 in 120 enthralling minutes at Hampden Park. But Clement was left fuming at VAR, believing his side should have been awarded a penalty early into the second half in what would have been a major turning point in the match. Liam Scales grabbed a handful of Vaclav Cerny's shirt and pulled him to the ground, receiving a yellow card for the foul. A free-kick was awarded right on the edge of the box. ""I don't know if you saw the images back, but my phone is overloaded with the penalty situation with Cerny. I get hundreds of messages now about that. That's also a really decisive moment in the game. ""Of course, he (the referee) cannot see that moment. But he didn't get the communication from the VAR to come to watch the screen, which for me is a really weird situation. At least there's no look about that kind of situation in this kind of game, about the situation that the referee can make a decision in that way. ""I didn't see it at the time because I still have quite good eyes, but I cannot see that much distance if the foot is outside or inside or on the line.

Clement is yet to beat Celtic as Rangers manager but was proud of the attitude of his players. ""I would not like to be here speaking about a penalty because I want to speak about the team and what they did today,"" Clement said.

""Also the team spirit and the mentality and good football. I think it was a really good game for Scottish football, this final. ""Everybody can be happy about that but you want to win the trophy. ""But we had to do a lot of things extra to get it to our side if you don't get a penalty like that."" He believed the defeat, which came after Ridvan Yilmaz was the only player to fail to score his penalty, was ""cruel"". Tom from Southampton became a millionaire for free with Super 6!

  PHILIPPE Clement tonight described the decision not to award Rangers a penalty for a Liam Scales foul on Vaclav Cerny as “really weird” following the Ibrox club’s painful Premier Sports Cup final shoot-out defeat to their Parkhead rivals at Hampden.
 
  Referee John Beaton awarded the defending champions a free-kick after centre-half Scales pulled winger Cerny on the edge of his penalty box in the second half of the all Glasgow encounter.
 
  But video replays later showed that Cerny’s foot had touched the line while he was being held – and former match official Bobby Madden promptly took to social media to state it was a spot kick even though the offence had started outside of the area.
 
  Clement could understand why Beaton had failed to award a spot kick – but he was perplexed about why VAR official Alan Muir over at Clydesdale House had not urged his colleague to look back at the incident on his pitchside monitor.
 
  “Football can be amazing great and amazing fun,” said Clement whose team lost the shoot-out 5-4 after the game had finished 3-3 after 120 minutes. “But it can be very cruel. This was a really cruel one. 
 
  “I think my team deserved more today after creating more chances than the opponent. Coming back in a good way and losing with penalties at the end, it stays a casino game at that moment.
 
  “But also, I don't know if you saw the images back, but my phone is overloaded with the penalty situation with Cerny.  I get hundreds of messages now about that. That's also a really decisive moment in the game. 
 
   “Of course, he [Beaton] cannot see that moment. But he didn't get the communication from the VAR to come to watch the screen, which for me is a really weird situation. At least there's no look about that kind of situation in this kind of game, about the situation that the referee can make a decision in that way.
 
  “I didn't see it at the time because although I still have quite good eyes I cannot see that much distance if the foot is outside or inside or on the line. So, no, but my phone is full of messages from everybody.
 
  “Those are things I cannot control. So maybe it's also a very important moment to dig into that, about why there's no communication in that moment about a big decision like that, because it's clear for everybody it's a game-decisive decision.” 
 
  Clement added: “I would not like to be here to speak about the penalty because I want to speak about the team, what they did today, how brave they were after a big European night on Thursday, giving a lot against Tottenham.  
 
  “Two days less recovery and showing the physical level they showed today. Also the team spirit, the mentality, but also good football. I think it was a really good game for Scottish football, this final, from both sides.  
 
  “Everybody only can be happy about that, but of course you want to win that trophy. We had to do then a lot of things extra to get it to our side. But if you don't get a penalty like that . . .”
 
  However, Clement, who has now lost five and drawn one of the six games his Rangers side has played against Celtic, admitted that his team should have capitalised on a four against one overlap early in the second half when they were 1-0 ahead.
 
  “It's a massive moment,” he said. “That's a really disappointing one, that we made the wrong choice there because on the left side we had two players free.  
 
  “If Hamza [Igamane] slows down his tempo and then gives this ball then it's impossible to defend. So, yeah, that's also for sure a crucial point in the game. But I think we grabbed a lot of moments in this game. 
 
  “Of course, we're going to show that one also to the team to make it better for the future. But I'm really proud about how many moments the team grabbed and how they played with and without the ball. Today, with all this energy, also after the changes, everybody's stepping in, doing the job. 
 
  “So we're getting better and better and that's our ambition now. It's a big blow not to have this trophy, clearly. But it's now important that it doesn't stop the hunger and desire that's in the squad to become better and better because we're going to work on that.”
 
  Meanwhile, Clement stressed that he was proud of Rangers left-back Ridvan Yilmaz, who had his penalty saved in the shoot-out, for being brave enough to step up and take a spot kick. 
 
  “I spoke already with him,” he said. “There are a lot of big names in football who are big stars in world football, who missed penalties or even didn't put the ball on target. So he took his responsibility.  
 
  “We've been practising the penalties all season. He did really well in that way, in the trainings. So it's part of football and I'm proud of guys who take responsibility in those moments. So that's part of being a football player.”

With Philippe Clement’s team 1-0 up thanks to Nedim Bajrami’s strike late in the first-half, Rangers looked certain to double their advantage mere moments after the interval. After forcing a below-par Celtic into another error, Rangers found themselves four v one and bearing down on Kasper Schmeichel’s goal; Hamza Igamane, Vaclav Cerny, Mohamed Diomande all waiting for Bajrami’s pull-back.  That was, of course, until Cameron Carter-Vickers slid in and turned the Albanian’s pass away for a corner. A turning point, certainly. Former Celtic boss Neil Lennon accepts that Rangers ‘deserved’ to find themselves 2-0 up. Instead, as Greg Taylor and Daizen Maeda struck, Rangers were 2-1 down in the blinking of an eye. Would a two-goal advantage have been enough for Rangers to defend their Scottish League Cup crown? Was Carter-Vickers’ intervention the most integral moment in a match full of flashpoints?  Possibly, and probably. Speaking to BBC Scotland at full-time, Celtic eventually triumphing on penalties, Carter-Vickers accepts that Brendan Rodgers’ side found life extremely tough against a Rangers who, like against Tottenham Hotspur only three days earlier, closed the gaps, got in their faces, and played with the sort of aggression, intensity and belief seldom-seen in the season’s opening weeks. “It was a tough game,” Carter-Vickers admits. “Fair play to Rangers. They had a really good game plan which made it tough for us to get our flow going. “To win a final on penalties… If you know you’re going to win it, you’d always pick to win it that way. “Physically and mentally, it was tough. But it shows the togetherness of this group.” The outstanding Nico Raskin epitomised Rangers’ approach at Hampden Park like no other. Alongside the similarly impressive Mo Diomande, the Belgian continued his outstanding recent form – Philippe Clement lauded Raskin’s ‘evolution’ after Spurs – as he snapped into tackles throughout, albeit he must take some blame for his involvement in Maeda’s strike. Bajrami impressed off the ball, too. Rangers knew stopping Celtic’s Callum McGregor from dictating proceedings was a must. And, for the most part, they did just that. “Celtic [found it] really difficult to play through the lines,” Lennon said during his co-commentary duties for Premier Sports. “Celtic haven’t been at their fluid best, but maybe that’s down the way Rangers have played. They have been nice and compact in their midfield shape but they’ve been aggressive as well. You’ve got to give Rangers credit for the way they are set up.” Following 90 gruelling minutes up against former Hoops boss Ange Postecoglou on Thursday night, Rangers understandably tired as Celtic began to seize control in the second-half at Hampden.  Yet, Clement will have been delighted by the resolve of his team. Rangers have collapsed against their Old Firm rivals in the recent past but not here.  Diomande put The Gers level again at 2-2 while Danilo, off the bench to power home a header, ensured that Nicolas Kuhn’s 87th minute finish was not the winner it looked destined to be.",

  Now, new footage has emerged showing hordes of rival supporters clashing on the street with punches thrown and pyrotechnics devices lobbed across the street.
 
  A large pack of Rangers ultras - in balaclavas and Santa hats - can initially be seen moving down the street before backing away as onlookers filmed the melee.
 
  Seconds later and the ultras were engaged in a violent clash with rival supporters with footage showing physical confrontations and flares being thrown between Celtic and Rangers supporters.

  The group remained in place for a few minutes before starting to move on after the violent scenes died down in the city centre.
 
  Police Scotland officers were authorised to use emergency stop and search powers after missiles were thrown between supporters on Argyle Street and reports of windows being smashed in Howard street.
 
  Chief Superintendent Stevie Dolan said: “We have dealt with a number of incidents in Glasgow city centre today involving individuals engaging in disorder and violence across the city.
 
  ""Officers have had to act swiftly and robustly to ensure public safety and reduce disorder. The use of weapons or violence will not be tolerated and officers will take action where necessary to ensure safety.
 
  ""It impacts other members of the public and the vast majority of football supporters who want to enjoy the cup final event safely. Officers will remain in the city as our operation continues and anyone with any concerns can approach them.""

  Rangers should have had a penalty when Liam Scales fouled Vaclav Cerny, according to the IFAB laws used to govern the game.
 
  The Celtic defender began his foul outside the box but footage shows conclusively the pulling continued on the line of the penalty area.
 
  And that means VAR should have intervened and advised John Beaton to come to the monitor to check his initial decision to award a foul at the edge of the box.
 
  Law 12 clearly states: ""If a defender starts holding an attacker outside the penalty area and continues holding inside the penalty area, the referee must award a penalty kick.""

The Gers are licking their wounds after succumbing to a 5-4 penalty kicks defeat against their eternal rivals following an enthralling 3-3 clash at Hampden. The match has been overshadowed by a controversial decision not to award Rangers a penalty for a clear tug in the box which was given by the referee as a free kick. Rangers manager Philippe Clement has demanded an inquest into the VAR in the aftermath of the situation and also hailed Ridvan Yilmaz for stepping up to take the spot kick. The Ibrox gaffer has also explained that Cyriel Dessers was next in line to hit a kick at Hampden. “(Cyriel Dessers) was on the list further,” Clement told Premier Sports. “He was the sixth normally to take the penalty. ”But we’ve been practising penalties all season and Jack (Butland) did really well in all this series, so we had a good eye who was good. ”We had more than five players to take a good penalty. Ridvan (Yilmaz) is normally also really good. ”But today he missed or the goalkeeper saved, it was not even a miss. ”That’s part of football. I know a lot of really big players, legends of the world of football, who missed a penalty or even didn’t put a ball on target. ”It’s part of the casino of penalty taking.” ""It's cruel today because you're the team who get the most chances in the game.

Chests were wheezing, legs cramping, hearts fluttering, rain falling. ""Carnage, just carnage"" as the Celtic defender Liam Scales said in the aftermath. The tension, the drama, the lost-soul demeanour of Ridvan Yilmaz as he walked back to the halfway line having had his penalty saved by Kasper Schmeichel. The sight of Jack Butland, the Rangers goalkeeper, then having to score against Schmeichel to keep his team alive in the shoot-out, which he did. Then the suspense as Daizen Maeda stood over that last kick, the big opportunity to finally put a gallant Rangers to sleep, which he took. Unerringly. Maeda carries himself like a man who laughs in the face of pressure, who pokes a finger in the eye of stressful situations such as this. At no point did you really get a feeling that he was going to miss.  That's not being wise after the event. This was in real time. Maeda looked like he was in his element.  He was oh so cool in the final seconds of a final that for big chunks reached epic proportions. Celtic beat Rangers on penalties after epic More Celtic reaction & have your say What are they saying in the Rangers camp? Rangers looked stunned and sickened, as well they might. Of all the blows that Celtic have inflicted on them in recent seasons, this has to be the most painful. Worse, surely, than last season's Scottish Cup final, secured at the death by Adam Idah. That had been a scrap. On that day, Rangers hadn't delivered anything like the goals and moments they came up with on Sunday. More grievous than the Scottish Cup semi-final in April 2023 won by Jota? For sure.  More sickening in its own way than the 3-0s and 4-0s visited upon them in the time of Ange Postecoglou and earlier this season? You have to think so. Those were heavy beatings with no excruciating what-might-have-beens attached. Regret was the difference.  At 1-0 at Hampden on Sunday, and with Celtic a rattled version of their usual selves, Rangers broke free and had a four-on-one. Hamza Igamane was in control of the ball with men running free outside him. Had he made the right decision, it was a one-on-one with Schmeichel from point-blank range. He didn't. He made a bad call. Sliding doors. A possible 2-0 went begging. There was more. Three minutes into the first period of extra time, Scales tugged Vaclav Cerny so microscopically close to the penalty box that Philippe Clement complained later about a lack of VAR intervention. He had a point.  Rangers folk may feel tortured by those what-if moments as much as the missed penalty much later on. As Celtic lifted the trophy, most Rangers fans had already exited, presumably having had a bellyful of disappointment for one day. Only Butland and Cyriel Dessers took it in from the touchline. Suckers for punishment, perhaps. This video can not be played Clement's phone 'overloaded with penalty' incident Rangers had a checklist of things that they had to get right to make a proper final of this and one by one they ticked them off. Score first - they did it having not done it in their previous six games against Celtic.  It was their first goal against Rodgers' team in more than four hours of football, the first time they were ahead against Celtic in more than nine hours. What else was on their must-do sheet?  Shut down the wounding influence of McGregor - they did that.  Show ruthlessness in front of goal - yes.  Silence Kyogo Furuahshi - done.  Bring the intensity and work rate and aggression and character of Thursday against Tottenham to Hampden - achieved, with bells and whistles attached. Tick, tick, tick. Character? They had it in spades.  When Greg Taylor, villain turned hero, and then Maeda transformed a 0-1 into a 2-1, it looked like Celtic had finally got hold of things. We thought we knew which way this was heading at that point, but we hadn't a clue. Nicolas Raskin and Mohamed Diomande had put in towering performances in hustling and harrying and living in the face of a Celtic midfield that has brought ruination to their door so often - and it was Diomande who levelled. With 15 minutes of normal time left, it was 2-2. With three minutes left, it was 3-2 Celtic.  Twenty one seconds after the restart it was 3-3, Danilo's header extending the final and hammering home the point that Rangers have found something of late, a bit of steel and a bit of belief. But no trophy to go with it. This video can not be played 'Most important thing is being on the podium at the end' - Rodgers Incredibly, McGregor has never lost a cup final, but ""it was mighty close today,"" he said. The captain was as relieved as he was honest.  ""The performance wasn't great, so we had to grind it out. We had to hold our nerve. Even when you're not perfect, you can still win. Dig in. Find something extra."" Pyro, predictably, reappeared and kick-off was delayed, two more fingers being raised by the ultras to their own clubs and to the footballing authorities who practically begged them to behave. More charges pending from the SPFL? Let's see. When the action began, it was toe-to-toe. Rangers were physical and uncompromising.  Amid the maelstrom, Taylor lost his head, played a square ball that was a bad idea and also poorly executed in any event and that was the catalyst for the opener. The omens were good for Rangers. Only four teams who have scored first in the last 49 League Cup finals have failed to win the trophy. But stats don't take into account Celtic's steepling self belief. They were in trouble - no space, no control, not many chances - but they found their way out of it. Celtic's mental strength is a thing of wonder. They were nowhere near their best and yet they have another title to their name. The shoot-out came and with it came memories of Rangers' in the Europa League denouement in Seville against Eintracht Frankfurt. Aaron Ramsey, then. Yilmaz now. Schmeichel did his thing. There was gamesmanship in the way he tried to put off some Rangers penalty takers. There were some mocking words in reply from Ianis Hagi after he buried his kick past the Dane.   Ultimately, this odyssey came down to Yilmaz versus Schmeichel and Maeda versus Butland. Celtic won, by a whisker or by a mile, it doesn't really matter.  A different kind of victory from before, but the same feelgood in one dressing room and presumably the same silence and despair in the other. Sporting drama at its best .

The Gers and their eternal Old Firm rivals Celtic were tied 3-3 in extra time when Liam Scales pulled Vaclav Cerny back on the edge of the box. Whilst a free kick was awarded, replays prove that Liam Scales pulled Vaclav Cerny inside the area and the situation should’ve been sent for a VAR review. Rangers also should’ve been awarded a penalty at a crucial juncture of the game. Philippe Clement had to be careful come full-time but the Rangers manager has poked the conspiracy bear by claiming the decision was ‘really weird’. ”This was a really cruel one I think,” said Clement. “I think my team deserved more today. ”Creating more chances than the opponent, coming back in a good way and then losing with penalties in the end. “But also I don’t know if you saw the images back but my phone is overloaded with the penalty situation with Cerny. ”So I get hundreds of messages now about that. That’s also a really decisive moment in the game.  “Yes of course he cannot see that that moment but he didn’t get the communication from the VAR to come to watch the screen. ”What’s for me is a really weird situation, that at least there’s no look about that kind of situation in this kind of game. ”About the situation that the referee can make a decision.” 🔊 LISTEN: “My phone is overloaded with the Cerny penalty situation.”“I hope that you guys really dig in to things.”🔵 Philippe Clement believes Rangers should have been awarded a penalty during their Premier Sports Cup final defeat to Celtic. ⬇️ pic.twitter.com/yaAujIFY9A Referee John Beaton didn’t award the penalty kick on the pitch but the situation should’ve been picked up by VAR. With whistler Beaton under immense pressure from Celtic, their fans and pro-Celtic pundits for conspiracies concerning Rangers, much of the attentions are routinely on the shoulders of the man of the middle. But VAR Alan Muir and his assistant Frank Connor have had their credentials indirectly questioned by Philippe Clement. The Rangers manager has urged journalists to get out the bottom of why the VAR didn’t halt play, giving rise to major questions about the professional competency and/or integrity of the officials in charge. ”I know all of you like to dig in deep into things,” said Clement. “So maybe it’s also a very important moment to dig into that. ”About why there’s no communication in that moment, about a big decision like that. ”Because it’s clear for everybody it’s a game decisive decision.  “I hope that you guys really dig into things, I hope.”",

The Light Blues left-back saw his effort from 12 yards saved by Kasper Schmeichel before watching on helplessly as Reo Hatate and then Daizen Maeda finished past Jack Butland, who took and scored Rangers‘ fifth penalty. Gers had been denied a penalty during the match as they performed admirably to push Celtic all the way. When Vaclav Cerny was pulled down by Liam Scales, a free-kick was awarded but the tug on the jersey appears to have happened inside the box. But Philippe Clement can take positives from the performance – with one Rangers man singled out by Neil Lennon for an ‘excellent’ display. Rangers News gave out two 8/10s in our player ratings after a performance that came so close to delivering a second trophy for Clement. But ultimately it was that one heartbreaking moment for Yilmaz that has been Rangers’ undoing. The Turkish defender showed courage to step forward and take one but it wasn’t the best of penalties. Lennon has questioned why Yilmaz was taking one anyway and says he’d have preferred one of the subs to take as they would be fresher. “It’s a great save. He’s got down quickly,” he said on Premier Sports. “It’s not a great contact. I wasn’t overly confident on Yilmaz going up to take it.  “I’m looking at Dessers, I’m looking at Dowell, Connor Barron…They were fresh. They’d only been on for 10/15 minutes. “You’re a number nine – get forward and take a penalty instead of leaving it to the young left-back.” Kasper Schmeichel saves! 🍀#PremierSportsCup pic.twitter.com/KCXi35hFYm Michael Stewart was then asked whether Rangers fans would have been expecting Dessers to be one of the takers. He replied: “Yeah. Neil makes a good point there about being fresh. I don’t know whether they’ve thought that he’s not been on long enough to be up to speed. “But as a striker I’m thinking you would want that. “But then there is that perception with Dessers. I don’t know whether half the Rangers support would have been nervous to see him stepping up. “For the goalkeeper to be the fifth penalty taker is quite incredible.” Stewart makes a good point about Dessers – there likely would have been a lot of anxiety had he stepped up. And he is perhaps not the most obvious choice of penalty taker. Spot kicks are about composure and striking the ball cleanly, neither of which are always Dessers’ strong points. So you can see why he potentially wasn’t high up on the list",

For instance, would Rangers have gone on to defend the trophy they lifted in 2023 had Nedim Bajrami picked out a better pass with three teammates – Vaclav Cerny, Hamza Igamane and Mo Diomande – waiting to tap the ball home? What if Nico Raskin had not deflected Greg Taylor’s volley past Jack Butland mere moments after that four-v-one opportunity was squandered?  What if the Belgian – Raskin was largely ‘excellent’ for Rangers but made a crucial error just before the hour – had put a little more on his header as Daizen Maeda fired Celtic ahead for the first time? Philippe Clement was furious, meanwhile, after Vaclav Cerny was adjudged to have been fouled outside of The Hoops penalty area. The winger was clipped while his foot appeared to be on the line but a free-kick was given. But while Clement lay plenty of blame at the door of the officials, he remained fulsome in his backing for Ridvan Yilmaz. The luckless left-back who – the only one to miss as Rangers and Celtic traded ten spot-kicks in the resulting penalty shoot-out – saw his effort pushed aside by a stretching Kasper Schmeichel. “For sure, he will bounce back,” Clement says, speaking after Maeda’s lashed home from 12 yards to ensure the cup’s ribbons will change from blue to green.  “It is a hard thing to miss the decisive penalty. Not really to miss because the goalkeeper saves!” Yilmaz is not the first player to see a penalty saved, of course. As Clement himself points out – days after the Rangers boss hailed Yilmaz’s ‘warrior’ spirit – some of the greatest talents in football history have shared that same pain.  See Cristiano Ronaldo, Paul Scholes and Roberto Baggio, to name just three from modern times and modern cup finals.  “I told him really big names in world football have missed penalties,” Clement adds, pleased to see Yilmaz step up and put himself on the line. “He took responsibility and thats what I need.  “Players who take responsibility, who give everything for the colours. “We’ve been practising the penalties all season. [Yilmaz] did really well in the training. So, it’s part of football and I’m proud of guys who take responsibility in those moments. That’s part of being in football.” Goalkeeper Butland was, of course, the most surprising of Rangers’ five spot-kick takers. There was to be no Joe Hart moment for Clement’s number one, succeeding where the former Celtic glovesman failed against Aberdeen back in April. “Like I said, everybody’s been [training[ penalties all season,” Clemenet says. “And Jack has been doing that really well.  “I would not do it, of course, in a normal game because you can get a counter-attack. But we looked really [strong in training], so that’s why [Butland took a penalty]. “Football is sometimes really cruel, but they gave everything and I was proud about that. And penalties are always a casino game, in a way. So, we’re on the wrong end today.  “It’s about digging in, keep on working what they’ve been doing and like this to become better and better the next couple of months.”",

The Gers were eventually beaten 5-4 on spot kicks after a 3-3 draw, with Rangers controversially being denied a penalty kick in extra time. Come the final whistle, fans are reflecting on a team who gave their all at Hampden but still came up short as Celtic overtake Rangers’ all-time major honours record. And there’s one player who has been heavily criticised in the aftermath of the game for both his performance on the pitch and his apprehension to take a penalty. Ridvan Yilmaz was the man who missed the decisive penalty kick for Rangers and Celtic netted every single one of their opportunities from 12 yards. But Rangers fans reckon Cyriel Dessers should’ve been the one taking the penalty, with the Rangers striker not amongst the five players who stepped up from the spot. Combined with the striker’s tepid cameo in the match, it’s led to much frustration come full time. Cyriel Dessers was subbed on by Rangers in the hope of making an impact and barely left any kind of imprint on the game. With Rangers needing fresh legs, it’s a lack of effort and commitment which has infuriated Ibrox fans as they criticise the striker’s tepid performance and apprehension to take a penalty. Difficult to sum up in the immediate aftermath what this means for us as a club, so won’t try. If Dessers wasn’t confident enough to hit a penalty then he was right to say so, but he should never play for us again. If you don’t back yourself in big moments then you’re no use pic.twitter.com/8wr7QCIc15 Conversations need to be had over why Ridvan took that 4th penalty instead of Dessers.Is Dessers mentality that weak? Dessers not taking a penalty before Yilmaz and Butland tells me everything i already knew about him. Dessers letting the goalie take a penalty before him is unforgivable. Another Rangers supporter echoes the sentiment that a ‘number nine’ striker not taking a penalty before a left-back and a goalkeeper is ‘unforgivable’. The irked fan claims that such mentality ‘should be nowhere near’ Ibrox Stadium. Others have followed suit, with the situation the final straw for many, who are asking Rangers to ‘get him gone’ in January or that this ‘should be the end’ of the striker’s time in Glasgow. With Kieran Dowell’s tame cameo also in the spotlight, one popular X user has summed up the sentiment of the Rangers support. Obviously not the time for it, but we shouldn't see dowell or dessers play for this club again.Don't care how we get rid of them in January but today's their last game. It’s a long way back when you lose the Rangers support and the likes of Cyriel Dessers have some major making up to do.",

The Saints conceded all five goals in a torrid first half at St. Mary's – with the first going in after just 36 seconds – subjecting them to a 13th league defeat of the campaign. Southampton sit bottom of the table on just five points, nine away from safety, and have won just once in the Premier League this season – a 1-0 win over Everton in November. They have conceded 36 goals while scoring a league-low 11, with Southampton averaging just 0.31 points per game in the top-flight since their promotion. The home fans booed Martin during and after Sunday's match, though he acknowledged their frustration in his post-match comments. ""After the first goal, our response was very poor,"" he said. ""I was hurt in the first half. We did not respond very well to the setbacks as a group. We have seen that all too often this season. ""It's disappointing because we had worked on a plan. We had a week's training, and the players have been part of that process, but we did not carry out anywhere near the intensity or aggression we needed. I didn't recognise our team in the first half.

""We have no choice but to keep working and fighting. It's what I have been doing in this job and I will continue doing it until I am told not to."" Southampton confirmed that Under-21s manager Simon Rusk will take charge on an interim basis, with an EFL Cup tie against Liverpool on Wednesday and a trip to Fulham in the Premier League coming up. ""Going into the start of the season, we all knew the challenges that we would face this year as we readjusted to life in the top-flight, competing in the best and most competitive league in the world,"" Southampton said in a statement.

Southampton have sacked manager Russell Martin following their 5-0 Premier League defeat to Tottenham on Sunday. The Saints conceded all five goals in a torrid first half at St. Mary's – with the first going in after just 36 seconds – subjecting them to a 13th league defeat of the campaign. Southampton sit bottom of the table on just five points, nine away from safety, and have won just once in the Premier League this season – a 1-0 win over Everton in November. They have conceded 36 goals while scoring a league-low 11, with Southampton averaging just 0.31 points per game in the top-flight since their promotion. The home fans booed Martin during and after Sunday's match, though he acknowledged their frustration in his post-match comments. ""After the first goal, our response was very poor,"" he said. ""I was hurt in the first half. We did not respond very well to the setbacks as a group. We have seen that all too often this season. ""It's disappointing because we had worked on a plan. We had a week's training, and the players have been part of that process, but we did not carry out anywhere near the intensity or aggression we needed. I didn't recognise our team in the first half.

James Maddison scored a brace, and Tottenham also got goals from Son Heung-Min, Dejan Kulusevski, and Pape Sarr, all in the first half, as Spurs rolled to a 5-0 win over Saints at St. Mary’s Stadium. Were Tottenham really that good? Were Saints just really THAT bad? Yes? Both? It doesn’t really matter. Spurs needed a win to get the vibes back on track and show everyone that they are still relevant in the Premier League under Ange Postecoglou and they got one in spades.

Seeing the likes of Djed Spence and Lucas Bergvall getting their first Premier League starts for the club, Spence made an instant impact 30 seconds into the game. Winning a strong touch with a defender on his back, Spence turned his Saints defender and made his way towards the Saints half of the pitch. Spence carried the ball and found the streaking James Maddison through the middle of the Saints’ defense. Receiving the weighted ball from Spence, Maddison hit his shot through the legs of Alex McCarthy and into the back of the net 37 seconds into the game for a 1-0 lead. Dictating the game in the entirety of the first half as Southampton have proven to be the laughing stock of the leg this year with poor defending, Spurs jumped on them with a defensive mistake for the second goal. Maddison sent a cross into the box, and with the ball flicked by a Southampton defender— leaving the other disposed in marking — the ball fell to Heung-min Son for a first-time volley into the ground and through McCarthy for a 2-0 lead 11 minutes in. Leading 2-0 for the second consecutive week — with the hope of seeing through an early lead and three points to tally — Spurs continued the drubbing four minutes later. Son received a ball on the left wing from Maddison off a break, and with it, he had Dejan Kulusevski going through the muddle and Dominic Solanke prowling behind for the ball. As Son sent a low driven cross towards the six-yard box for Solanke, the ball couldn’t come out of the feet quick enough for the striker. Still, with the defender and goalie out of position with the ball laying around the spot, Kulusevski finished his run with an easy strike on goal for a 3-0 lead. Southampton’s Russell Martin made a tactical substitution to stop the bleeding, but Spurs kept coming. Destiny Udogie began the break for the fourth goal as he won the ball off a Southampton attacker and went down the pitch with Son on his left. Giving Son a well-timed ball to cut back onto his right foot, Son squared his pass to the top of the box with a streaking Pape Sarr coming onto it. In full sprint with his touch, Sarr pulled off the teckers with his dribbling as he left Saints defenders in the dust and a left-footed shot for a 4-0 lead. Son Heung-min has now provided more Premier League assists for Tottenham than any other player in the competition’s history (68).A club legend. ☀️ pic.twitter.com/Gy71Opbups After the goal, Udogie was subbed off as he was down, having his hammy looked, and he was subbed off for Pedro Porro. Udogie is now the 10th senior player to be injured or suspended for the side. What a time to have all this happening in the congested fixture run. In the final 10 minutes of the first half, both sides looked tired and ready for the break, but with 30 seconds left in the half, Maddison grabbed his brace off a spectacular finish from an acute angle. Son played Maddison to the goal line, and with a fake shot chop to get the ball onto his favored right foot, Maddison fought off a tug of the shirt to leather his shot to the far top corner of the net for a 5-0 scoreline. 5-0! Unreal goal from James Maddison.pic.twitter.com/q1DOuORSlS In the second half, Spurs left off the gas a smidge, as neither side scored. But, multiple players had the chance to earn Premier League debuts for Ange Postecoglou. The two, in brilliant fashion, were Spence and Bergvall. Spence made an impact from both fullback positions before coming off with a calf injury after 70 minutes of action. For Bergvall, he was the No. 6 for the day, and although he had moments where he was outmuscled off the ball, Bergvall showed poise and recovered well. Overall, it was a brilliant night with the scoreline. Yes, it may be against one of the worst Premier League sides in history, but with how the up and down season has gone so far, this could be the start to flipping the season for a Top-4 push. Next, Spurs will host Manchester United in Thursday’s quarterfinal of the Carabao Cup. Gambling Problem? Call 1-800-GAMBLER (1-800-426-2537). Hope is here.

Martin had overseen 13 defeats in their 16 games since promotion back to the top flight in the summer. They are stuck in 20th, already nine points from safety and are now looking for a new boss. In his programme notes, Martin had called on Saints fans to ""keep believing"" in his players despite the predicament they currently find themselves in. Any effect those words might have had on supporters was rapidly eradicated. With just 36 seconds on the clock, James Maddison swept the opener after Djed Spence easily brought the ball forward through the middle of the park. It was the earliest Saints had conceded in the Premier League since November 2013. It was 2-0 after 12 minutes when Heung-Min Son slotted home after Jan Bednarek's poor header, and 3-0 two minutes later, with Son turning provider for Dejan Kulusevski to turn the ball home from close range. That was enough for the home fans to direct their frustrations towards Martin, but the fourth from Pape Sarr - following abysmal defending in the 25th minute - sparked a mass exodus from St Mary's. It was the earliest Tottenham had led by four goals in a Premier League game. Martin trudged down the tunnel before the half-time whistle and not only missed the intense boos from the home fans that greeted it, but Maddison's second of the evening, from the tightest of angles.

             There was no such intensity in the second half. In fact, Spurs only attempted a single shot in the second half, with Son, Maddison and Dominic Solanke withdrawn with one eye on Thursday's Carabao Cup quarter-final against Manchester United, which is live on Sky Sports. Southampton did try to reduce the deficit, with Tyler Dibling arguably their biggest threat. Mateus Fernandes headed in late on, but knew he had strayed offside immediately. Ultimately, they could do nothing to take the gloss off; the job was already done. Under-pressure Southampton manager Russell Martin speaking to TNT Sports straight after the game: ""I'm hurt at the first half. We just don't respond very well to setbacks as a group. ""Ultimately, it's hurt us a lot this season. We concede so early and we have a chance to foul Djed Spence in the middle of the pitch, and we don't. Then we're 1-0 down, and then the response after that is incredibly poor. So very disappointing. ""Probably the most disappointing thing is we have a plan that I love the week's training. The players have been a part of that process, but we don't carry out with anywhere near enough intensive aggression, because we concede literally the first action they have the ball. So then that's down to mentality and still wanting to stick to it. ""So I didn't recognise our team in the first half. I'm pleased they stuck at it in the second. But it's a tough night."" On whether boos from home crowd affect him: ""As a person, no. Because I understand it's not personal. I don't know them and they don't know me. ""As a manager, yeah, of course, it hurts me. It hurts the team, but I also understand it."" Asked where he goes from here: ""I think we have no choice but to work and fight. It's all I've done since I've been in this job, and it's all I'll continue to do until I'm told otherwise."" Southampton goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale speaking to TNT Sports: ""A difficult one. The early goal sucker-punched us and we just never recovered. ""Give the credit to Tottenham - James Maddison player of the match. ""Tonight's a real difficult one for us to take."" On Russell Martin: ""I feel very sorry for him. I think the lads are still trying for him. I don't think there's any question of anything on Russell Martin. ""The fans do deserve better and they're sticking with us, and it's one we have to move on very quickly ahead of Wednesday."" Tottenham head coach Ange Postecoglou speaking at his post-match press conference about his senior players Son and Maddison standing up: ""Yeah, they were brilliant. I think they sensed that they needed to tonight. We're just spread so thin that we're asking young players and players who haven't played a lot and others who are playing all the time to go out there and still try and play to our identity, still try and play the football we want to and I thought they were both a catalyst for that tonight with both their football but also their mindset of just going out there. ""We had to start strong today. We kind of knew we'd probably run out of gas at the end of the game considering the line-up we had out there and coming off Europe on Thursday night, so I think the players sensed that and credit to them that they started the game that way."" On the win: ""Really proud of the players. Obviously we had a tough away European fixture on Thursday night [at Rangers]. We had 10 first-team players unavailable for a number of reasons today, so out of a squad of 25 you do the sums. ""We asked a lot of them to again go out there and dig into their wells of energy and a couple we put out there haven't played for ages so the fact that boys can play with such energy and quality is just outstanding and really pleased that they get the rewards for it because they deserve it.""

SO MUCH FOOTBALL! WATCH THE FOOTBALL! IT’S GONNA MOVE!!! Another week, and it’s yet another multi-match one, as the fixtures keep on coming for Tottenham Hotspur. Southampton are this weekend’s opponents, as Spurs head south to take on the embattled Saints. Southampton are firmly bottom of the Premier League table with only one win this season; but matches against these kinds of sides have not gone well for the Lilywhites thus far in the 24/25 campaign. Losing to the likes of Crystal Palace and Ipswich Town and with a squad running on fumes, this match could be a sucker punch for Spurs with only one fit center back and injuries plaguing the side. With that said, we know Tottenham Hotspur has the ability to put any team to the sword, and Ange Postecoglou will be setting expectations high for this match. It’s possible we could see some new faces in new roles as well, with this fixture a potential option for rotation. As we all know, though, no match is easy in this league. COYS!

          Football Journalist
       Sunday 15 December 2024 16:00, UK Our football betting expert Jones Knows is back to provide more Premier League insight as he hunts down the value in the markets. When it looks like a draw, walks like a draw, quacks like a draw, then it's probably a draw. And it becomes an interesting betting angle when that outcome is priced up as the outsider of the three at 11/4 with Sky Bet. When it comes to draws these two teams are superb at them. Crystal Palace have drawn a Premier League-high seven games this season and Brighton have drawn six - the joint second-most games. Six of the last 10 meetings have also ended 1-1. Keep the draw on your side. The fallen-giant derby. Both teams are on their lowest points total after 15 Premier League games. This sharp decline of Manchester City is becoming a maddening thing to unpack with Pep Guardiola's insistence that City are playing well while acting uncharacteristically hapless in trying to fix it is certainly adding to the circus of it all.

             The defensive numbers behind City's results of seven defeats in 10 are extraordinary - a sackable offence for most managers. Since October 5, City are working at a per-game average of conceding 2.79 big chances on their goal - only Ipswich and Southampton have a worse return. Teams are charging past them in transition at will and their per-game average of being dribbled past figure of 10.36 is extraordinary - only West Ham have a higher average. Guardiola's side have conceded two or more goals in nine of their last 10 matches, meaning the 7/4 with Sky Bet on Manchester United following suit and scoring at least twice is the value call in a winnable game for Ruben Amorim if he gets his tactics right to expose City's laughable make-up out of possession. Why aren't Chelsea serious title contenders? It's a question I've been pondering as they've shortened dramatically into 6/1 with Sky Bet for the Premier League crown. The inconsistency factor is high on that reasoning. Teams that win titles win matches when not playing well. I'm not sure this young Chelsea side are there yet - there are going to be bumps in the road, especially with such an unreliable goalkeeper in Robert Sanchez between the sticks. That bump could be on the horizon here. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Credit to them they've managed to fend off a funny result for most of the season but one might be due, which may help dampen the expectations in the long run. Brentford haven't lost to Chelsea in five matches, winning the last three at Stamford Bridge. Yes, Thomas Frank's football isn't quite as savage on the road but they will hold no fear and Chelsea look a risky prospect at 1/3 with Sky Bet for the win, especially at an odd kick-off time. Brentford double chance at 9/4 it is then. Tyler Dibling is going to win Southampton a game on his own soon - he's that good. And in truth, Russell Martin probably needs him to as the Saints carry little attacking threat, bar the exciting vibes that Dibling brings. This might be the night where Dibling delivers a big one. Defences don't come as generous as Tottenham's without Micky van de Ven - he is so instrumental to Ange Postecoglou's style of football and his weak hamstrings will probably be the big Aussie's downfall as Spurs look flat, timid and a shell of their best at the moment. Dibling to score in a home win at 9/1 with Sky Bet stands out. Andoni Iraola's unique and hard-to-stop football is surely going to land him a top job soon enough - if a vacancy were to come up at Tottenham for example, Iraola should be their number one priority. In the last 44 games, Iraola has Bournemouth as the sixth-best team in the Premier League - that is an outrageous achievement for a club who were only promoted two seasons ago. Just look at how subsequent promoted teams have fared, it's no easy task. They are a better football team in every department than West Ham, who once again looked quite stodgy and lacking identity in their important win over Wolves. The home win is skinny enough at 7/10 with Sky Bet but adding under 4.5 goals into the mix gets us to a 5/4 shot that makes sense considering the Cherries have seen under that line in 10 of their last 12 home matches.

Ajax went full strength against the Italian side, who decided to rest some players including Tijjani Noslin, who only had a place on the bench. Ajax began the game on top but they missed two early chances and that was eventually punished by Lazio. In the 12th minute, Pedro set up Loum Tchaouna to fire past Remko Pasveer. Before the break, Brian Brobbey missed a good chance but early in the second half, Bertrand Traore finished well to make it 1-1. However, Lazio regained their lead quickly with Fisayo Dele-Bashiru netting from close range.  Ajax brought on Chuba Akpom and Wout Weghorst but the equaliser did not come and eventually Pedro added a third for the visitors. Ajax are still in the running for a top eight spot but they must beat RFS in the next match before ending the round against Galatasaray. 77.

The Amsterdam-born striker enjoyed a relatively steady rise through the amateur ranks of USV Hercules, DHSC and semi-pro TOP Oss, before an impressive spell with Fortuna Sittard brought the attention of Hellas Verona and now Lazio. In his press conference appearance in the run-up to this heavyweight Europa League battle, Noslin spoke of his recent rise, and of course, an intriguing run of form that saw him notch an impressive hat-trick against Napoli in the Coppa Italia. Tijjani Noslin scored a great hattrick last night as #Lazio beat #Napoli 3-1 in the #CoppaItalia 🎩 Not bad going from the former Fortuna Sittard striker 💥pic.twitter.com/n0da9Wcfpf With those heights mentioned though, even the novelty of chatting with the press isn’t lost on the 25-year-old. “It’s a huge honour, I’ve never experienced anything like it. I’m really curious about the questions that will come.” And of course, he gets those questions. Because Noslin’s story is special. For a working and studying amateur footballer, reaching the Eredivisie at Fortuna Sittard was of course already unimaginable. So, to reach solid heights in Italy? Even better. “Football is very much alive in Rome. In certain places, there are a lot of fans who want to take a picture of you, but that’s not a problem.” Following his brilliant trifecta against the Neapolitans – the cheerful attacker explained that, given his upbringing, he has not struggled to adjust to life in Italy. “I think it has to do with my life, with how I grew up. When you go through different difficult periods from a young age, it can help you. The things you learn on the street and at home, you can also take with you into football.” Tonight, Noslin has a very special chance to prove himself against Ajax. “Of course, you want to show everyone what you can do. Of course, you are also in your own city, where many family and friends come to watch. Then you always want to show something extra against Ajax.

In the two matches, that ended 2-2 and 2-1, Brian Brobbey had to settle for a place on the bench. However, the 22-year-old is expected to start against the Romans. Farioli praised his striker at the pre-Lazio press conference. “Brobbey is in the fittest phase of his Ajax career.” When presented with the remarkable win percentage for his side when Brobbey starts (86%), Farioli continued. “The data also shows that he can play a lot of minutes, at high intensity. We know how decisive he is, I don’t need those kinds of figures for that.” #Ajax are back at home tonight in the #UEL against #Lazio 🏡 Their scoring record in #Amsterdam :⚽️ 12 goals scored❌ 0 goals concededWill that continue this evening against I Biancocelesti?🎥: @EuropaLeague pic.twitter.com/RJtQb9evMB “If I have to come in, I feel good anyway. I feel okay and mentally very fresh,” says Brobbey himself about that. A main theme of the warm-up press conference was the fitness of the selection. Farioli, however, did not want to hear anything more about the word ‘tired’. “Anyone who talks about that will get a fine. So I will not use that word anymore.” Still aware to the issue, however, the Italian boss carried on: “Unfortunately, we cannot give anyone time off because we play every two days. We have to find the energy and motivation from within.” On the statuses of Jordan Henderson, Mika Godts and Devyne Rensch, Farioli hinted. “They are all OK, so they will be there on Thursday.” GBeNeFN | Max Bradfield @2023 - All Rights Reserved.

Football-Oranje's Michael, Mike and Abdul react to the Nations League ... Below is a round up of Sunday’s Eredivisie action. Groningen 0-0 PEC Zwolle Groningen and PEC Zwolle played out a 0-0 draw in the Euroborg. The hosts had the better chances in the first half but Thijs Oosting couldn’t convert two good opportunities that came his way. The match was more open after the break with Dylan Vente having a goal disallowed for PEC Zwolle, while Stije Resink and Romano Postema both had huge chances for the hosts before the end which weren’t taken. Groningen are in 14th and PEC Zwolle one spot above them. AZ Alkmaar 2-1 Ajax AZ Alkmaar defeated a toothless Ajax in the AFAS Stadion on Sunday. The hosts were by far the more threatening side in the first half but Ruben van Bommel hit the post while Remko Pasveer denied Ernest Poku. After the break, Wout Weghorst seemed to give Ajax the lead but he worked the ball into the net off his hand and it was disallowed.  Van Bommel hit the post again before Troy Parrott tapped in a Peer Koopmeiners cross to finally make it 1-0 in the 64th minute. Mayckel Lahdo then doubled the lead with a header from a Koopmeiners corner. Ajax pulled one back from the returning Mika Godts but AZ held on to claim the three points.  AZ is still 6th while Ajax are third. Willem II 1-2 Heerenveen A 94th-minute winner handed Robin van Persie his first away as Heerenveen head coach. The first half was forgettable with neither side creating many chances and it took until the 85th minute for the opening goal. Heerenveen got a penalty for a foul on Alireza Jahankbakhsh and Ion Nicolaescu converted. Willem II equalised quickly with Jeremy Bokila heading in but deep into injury time, Luuk Brouwers won it for Heerenveen.  The win moves Heerenveen to tenth while Willem II is in 12th. Almere City 1-3 Utrecht  Utrecht claimed second spot after a win over Almere City. Ajax dropping points earlier on Sunday gave Utrecht the chance to reclaim second and Ron Jans side made no mistake. Yoann Cathline hit the woodwork for Utrecht before Mike van der Hoorn netted from a corner to make it 1-0. An excellent strike from Zidane Iqbal then sealed then doubled the lead before the break. Logan Delaurier Chaubet pulled one back for the hosts but Noah Ohio sealed the victory for Utrecht in the 94th minute.  Utrecht are second and Almere City is in 18th. 76. ⚽️ 𝐆𝐎𝐀𝐋𝐋𝐋𝐋𝐋!!!Het wordt 2-0 voor AZ door een doelpunt van Lahdo!

The left-winger seems to have recovered from his hamstring injury sustained last month against FC Twente. This news arrived as Ajax boss Francesco Farioli revealed the progress of a number of injured Amsterdammers in his pre-match press conference.  “Godts’ recovery is going well and I am positive towards Sunday.” “With Devyne Rensch it is a bit more complicated. If he can participate in the last training, he will be available on Sunday. Otherwise we will look at the next match.”  Injury update:✅ Mika Godts is fit again and could play against AZ on Sunday.❓ Devyne Rensch is still a question mark, If he can take part in the final training session, he will be available on Sunday. Otherwise, it'll be against Lazio on Thursday.#Ajax | #azAJA pic.twitter.com/RSNKHuVLOL In other news, Sivert Mannsverk will definitely not be there. “He will first get minutes with Jong Ajax.” Following these comments, the Italian looked ahead to the duel with AZ, saying, “(they are) a team with qualities and good organization.” “We are going to prepare ourselves as well as possible. I hope to see a bit of sharpness again that I have missed a bit in the last few games. With a good freshness in our minds, we have to make sure that we regain control on the field.” Previously, the manager addressed the injury situation with restraint, citing the stacked calendar as a potential reason for some of his player’s knocks. “The number of matches we play is high and we have to finish the last duels well. We shouldn’t look at the upcoming matches with pain, but with pleasure. From AZ away we will play important matches that will determine what our next steps will look like.” GBeNeFN | Max Bradfield  @2023 - All Rights Reserved. Get Football Group",

The scouts will pay close attention to 24-year-old Oğuz Aydın, who has been heavily linked with a move to the Amsterdam club due to his past with head coach Francesco Farioli. Oğuz Aydın joined Jose Mourinho’s Fenerbahçe last summer from fellow Süper Lig side Alanyaspor. Farioli was his previous manager and is now reportedly interested in linking up with the winger at Ajax. However, the Eredivisie giants face competition from several other European sides. Scouts from Rennes and Sevilla are also set to attend Saturday’s derby, focusing on Aydın. The Türkiye international joined Fenerbahçe for around €6m, meaning a higher fee would be required for him to leave. A January move for the forward seems unlikely given the short time he’s had at the club, but a switch next summer could potentially be on the cards.

In the match against FC Utrecht, the 41-year-old keeper was credited with an own goal, making him the oldest player ever to do so in the Dutch league. Domstedelingen’s Yoann Cathline smashed the post with a rock-hard shot just over ten minutes from time, yet the ball ricocheted rather unkindly and struck the back of Pasveer to find the net.  As a result, the Ajax goalkeeper is now the oldest player ever in the Eredivisie to have scored an own goal. Pech voor Pasveer: Utrecht via de doelman op 2-2!#ajautr Although the Amsterdam club managed to hold on to pull a 2-2 draw out of the fire in their own Johan Cruyff Arena, in a solid second-half showing, it was admittedly Ron Jans’ team that perhaps deserved the win. 41 – Against FC Utrecht, Remko Pasveer (41 years old) became the oldest player ever to score an own goal in an Eredivisie match, taking the record off of Rinus Israel (39 in 1981).

As Voetbal International report, it seems the Italian has clear explanations for the recent dip in performance. After the draw against Utrecht, Farioli was asked at the press conference how it was possible that Ajax was able to step on the gas against Feyenoord and PSV, but his team looked tired on Wednesday night. “That was five or six games ago, and you can calculate how many minutes ago that was. We are missing Mika Godts now and also had problems with Wout Weghorst and Brian Brobbey. So it is logical that you pay the price for that somewhere. More rotation? More than this is impossible (laughs).” Ajax, who were on the rise, suffered setbacks again against Utrecht. David Min took the lead for the visitors before an Anton Gaaei wondergoal and an own goal from Jens Toornstra gave the hosts the lead. With a late own goal from veteran stopper Remko Pasveer, Ajax waved goodbye to two dropped points.

There are still five matches to be played (before the winter break) and they are all important. We have to recharge and prepare ourselves in the best possible way for the match against AZ on Sunday.” GBeNeFN | Max Bradfield  @2023 - All Rights Reserved. Get Football Group",

Football-Oranje's Michael, Mike and Abdul react to the Nations League ... A late own goal earned FC Utrecht a 2-2 draw at Ajax on Wednesday evening.  The game was initially meant to be played in September but police strikes meant that the game had to be moved. Utrecht made a stronger start to the game and in the 16th minute, David Min put them 1-0 up after Ajax failed to clear a free kick.  A wonderful strike from Anton Gaaei made it 1-1 in the 25th minute before Jorrel Hato quickly put Ajax in front. Before the break, Utrecht created a number of chances but they could not find the equaliser. Niklas Vesterlund came closest but his effort was cleared off the line. Utrecht continued to push in the second half and in a fortunate manner they found the equaliser with 10 minutes later. A shot from Yoann Cathline came back off the post and found the net off of Remko Pasveer.  Before the end, Ajax were hanging on to a point and Victor Jansen and Miguel Rodríguez both missed huge chances to win it for the visitors. The point means that Ajax stay second and Utrecht third.

Football-Oranje's Michael, Mike and Abdul react to the Nations League ... Below is a round up of all the action from the Eredivisie on Sunday. FC Utrecht 2-5 PSV Eindhoven PSV Eindhoven put five goals past Utrecht in what could have been a tricky tie for the Eredivisie leaders. After the comeback victory in the Champions League in midweek, PSV had a clash against a potential title rival to overcome. Ismail Saibari put PSV ahead in the 12th minute with a close range header. A handball from Johan Bakayoko gave Utrecht the opportunity to equalise from the spot after 34 minutes and Anthony Descotte made no mistake.  Malik Tillman had a goal disallowed before the break but Guus Til made it 2-1 in the 54th minute. Saibari then made it 3-1 after a lovely attack.  Bakayoko finished off a swift counter to make it 4-1 before Siebe Horemans headed one back for the hosts. Til quickly added a fifth though with a fierce strike before Armando Obispo had a sixth disallowed before the end. An excellent win for PSV, who move 8 points clear at the top while Utrecht sits. AZ Alkmaar 1-0 Heracles Almelo AZ Alkmaar left it late to seal a slender 1-0 win over Heracles Almelo. AZ hadn’t sealed a home win in the league since September and in the opening stages they struggled to create chances. Ruben van Bommel did get a chance but he shot over the bar.  After the break, the hosts were in control but Alexandre Penetra, Seiya Maikuma and Sven Mijnans all missed good chances to break the deadlock. It appeared it was going to be a 0-0 draw but in the 89th minute, Maykel Lahdo fired in the winning goal. A huge relief for AZ, who sits sixth while Heracles is in 15th. FC Twente 3-2 Go Ahead Eagles FC Twente came from 2-0 down to earn a 3-2 win over Go Ahead Eagles. After the poor loss to USG in the Europa League, Sam Lammers was restored to the starting line up for Twente as they looked to get back to winning ways. Sem Stein missed a huge chance early on before Lammers hit the crossbar. Against the run of play, the visitors struck in the 24th minute as Jakob Breum found the net with a long range strike. Nine minutes later, Breum made it 2-0.  After an intelligent backheel from Steijn, Lammers pulled one back for FC Twente just before the break.  Twenty minutes before the end, Steijn made it 2-2 with a wonderful volley and then Bas Kuipers netted the winning goal against his former side. Twente are now fifth while Go Ahead Eagles is in 8th. NEC Nijmegen 1-2 Ajax  A double from Wout Weghorst led Ajax to a 2-1 victory over NEC Nijmegen. NEC made a strong start to the game and it wasn’t a shock when the opening goal came in the 13th minute. Remko Pasveer made an initial save but had no answer to Sontje Hansen on the rebound. The equaliser came two minutes later as a fine move ended with Weghorst finishing after good work by Kenneth Taylor. NEC then had a number of chances but Pasveer kept the hosts out before the break. Early in the second half, Jorrel Hato played Taylor in and he set up Weghorst to put Ajax in front. The crossbar then ensured Ajax stayed ahead as it denied a header from Dirk Proper. Chuba Akpom missed a big chance for Ajax late on but they still managed to take the three points. Ajax climbs to second while NEC is in 10th. 48.

The midfielder is said to be showing insufficient intensity on the pitch and also refusing to extend his contract. De Jong has had many problems with injuries over the past year and a half, and while the Dutch international has recently been seen on the pitch again, the higher-ups as Barça are reportedly frustrated with De Jong, according to the Spanish outlet. The Spanish giants believe that the former Ajax player does not show enough aggression and intensity. In the report, Fermín López, Gavi and Marc Casadó are mentioned as examples who do this well in contrast. Barcelona believe that De Jong has not yet lived up to his price tag of 85 million euros. In addition, according to Diario Sport, the midfielder refuses to extend his contract and the Catalan club are afraid that he could leave for free in 2026. De Jong made the switch from Ajax to FC Barcelona in 2019. He has played 221 matches for the Spanish powerhouse, scoring 17 times and recording 21 assists.

Much as he has been criticised for his reduced mobility in recent months, Harry Kane remains the highest-ranked British player, according to our average player ratings. Small wonder, really. After having scored 44 goals in 45 games for Bayern Munich last season, he’s started this season with 20 in 17, including 14 in 11 in the Bundesliga.  And that is what he’s paid to do. Whether he’s the best option in the number nine shirt for England is not quite the same question as whether he can still score goals, and he’s playing in a winning team. Bayern have only dropped four points so far this season, and have scored 36 goals in their first 11 league matches.  Only their Champions League form has been patchier, with them having lost two of their first four games. But with four still left to play, there’s still plenty of time to set that straight. Whatever the debate about Kane might be in England, in Germany he remains among the most dangerous of strikers.   It can be difficult at times to keep hold of the fact that Jude Bellingham is still only 21 years old, considering that he’s already won LaLiga and the Champions League, and has been a runner-up twice in the European Championships already.  It is possible to construct an argument that this season hasn’t quite been going according to plan, though. Their 4-0 home reversal against league leaders Barcelona at the end of October was a severe shock to the system. But following the weekend’s results, they have narrowed the gap to Barcelona at the top of the table, now sitting four points below them, with a game in hand.   More troublingly, for a club which expects to win the tournament every season, performances in the Champions League have been patchy, with strong home wins against Stuttgart and Borussia Dortmund, but tame defeats to Lille and Milan. But for all the team’s travails on the pitch, Bellingham remains the 8th-highest ranked player overall in LaLiga. His star hasn’t diminished in the slightest.  Jordan Henderson and Ajax came together at the end of what had been a difficult time for both parties. Henderson’s choice of club after leaving Liverpool resulted in a considerable amount of criticism and was followed by a relatively brief and unhappy spell in Saudi Arabia, while Ajax also faced criticism in the wake of the Marc Overmars scandal and had endured a difficult season in the Eredivisie, eventually finishing fifth. Things haven’t been perfect this time around, but they do seem to be improving. Henderson has been averaging a healthy 7.33 FotMob rating as captain of the club this season, and was recently praised by the Dutch football journalist Lentin Goodijk, who recently told VI ZSM that ‘Henderson is The Big Boss bij Ajax’.    For their part, Ajax are in third place in the table at the time of writing, seven points shy of leaders PSV Eindhoven. But in another sign that Ajax are getting back to something like their normal selves, they did beat PSV at The Johan Cruyff Arena at the start of November. There remain rumours that Henderson could be returning to England and back to where it all started more than a decade and a half ago at Sunderland, but Ajax are believed to be extremely keen to keep him.   He’s probably the least known name on this list, but Marc Bola has been instrumental in one of the surprise packages across all European leagues so far this season. This time last year, Samsunspor were in the relegation places in the Turkish SüperLig following promotion at the end of the season before. Bola, a product of the Arsenal academy who spent four years with Middlesbrough, signed for them in the September, and the team eventually pulled clear of the bottom to twelfth place by the end of last season.  This season has seen that improvement continue. At the time of writing they’re in third place in the table, and had they not lost their recent match 3-2 to leaders Galatasaray they could be in second ahead of José Mourinho’s Fenerbahçe. For a club who were only promoted back to this division two seasons ago that’s a spectacular start to the season and Bola, who plays at left-back, has made a full contribution towards this. His form may well attract the interest of bigger clubs, if not in the January transfer window then in the summer, should this form continue.    Going abroad towards the end of your playing career doesn’t always end in some sort of late reflowering. Eric Dier’s move to Bayern Munich in the January transfer window resulted in 15 appearances throughout the second half of the season, although he ended the season trophyless.  This season hasn’t been so much fun. Dier signed a one-year permanent deal during the summer but he’s only played four times so far this season in the league under new manager Vincent Kompany, and he has one of the lowest rankings on our list in terms of performances, at 6.59. There have been rumours of interest in him from Juventus, who need a replacement for the injured Gleison Bremer, or he could even find himself back in the Premier League.

Football-Oranje's Michael, Mike and Abdul react to the Nations League ... Teachers across the United Kingdom (myself included) are giving their first parents’ evening of the year. I thought I would take this opportunity to reflect on the start of each Eredivisie team, giving them an old fashioned school grade from A-F. 1st PSV Eindhoven A We expect a lot from our star pupil who sits top of the class, and they have largely delivered. PSV have only dropped points once so far, and they have scored 45 goals already, averaging 3.5 per game in the Eredivisie. Now we want to see further progress in the Champions League. 2nd FC Utrecht A+ Massive progress! The wins keep coming for Utrecht. There are no spectacular names on the team sheet, but motivation under manager Ron Jans is sky high as they continue to grind out results. Fans are dreaming of Europe. 3rd Ajax A– Another team taking great strides under a talented manager. At times the average performances have been covered up by the excellent results; though rather like a pupil with poor handwriting and presentation, the content is the most important thing. 4th Feyenoord C A mixed year so far. Highlights of a Dutch Super Cup win and impressive away days in the Champions League have been let down by some sloppy work in the Eredivisie. However, if Brian Priske’s men can go on a run of results from here, they are still in the title race.  5th FC Twente B After a disappointing start to the year, Twente have picked up some good results keeping them firmly in the European spots. A feeling that there is more to come. 6th AZ Alkmaar C- Youthful exuberance does little to mask what has been a frustrating past month or two for AZ Alkmaar. A winning run to start the campaign was followed up by one win in nine in all competitions. A win at Sparta in the last game gives hope that there is a change in fortunes coming. 7th Go Ahead Eagles B- The Eagles earnt the privilege to play in the Conference League back in the summer but they were quickly found to be out of their depth. Back to Eredivisie business, and some positive recent results have propelled the Eagles back into the playoff positions. 8th Fortuna Sittard B A side that ‘does their homework’ and picks up enough points to stay out of trouble. If progress continues, we may see a European push from Danny Buijs and co. 9th NEC Nijmegen C Some early disappointment for NEC has been quelled by three wins in six, giving hope of another season in the playoffs and a run in the Dutch Cup. 10th Willem II B After being promoted to the top class in the Netherlands, Willem II have been a sensible outfit thus far, conceding the fewest goals out of all sides in the bottom half. 11th NAC Breda B+ Another new Eredivisie classmate who is performing above expectations. There were concerns over NAC’s defending, but they have been picking up wins thanks to their brilliant support at home. 12th Heerenveen D+ Promised much, but delivered very little. Heerenveen love to attack under Robin van Persie, but there is little focus on the defensive aspect of their game. Some flashes of potential have been coming through from the likes of Trenksow on the wing. 13th Heracles Almelo C Heracles are just about keeping up. Quality from De Keersmaecker in midfield and the likes of Hornkamp and Kulenovic in attack will make sure they keep their heads above water. Sometimes the negative tactics away from home can hinder further progress.  14th PEC Zwolle C Another team doing what is expected of them without really pushing on. Despite being some people’s tip for relegation at the start of the campaign, PEC have been largely stable so far, and they nearly picked up a result at Ajax in their last match. 15th FC Groningen D It is difficult to be too harsh on a team that has just been promoted to the top flight, but most thought highly of Groningen’s return, especially after some early positive results. Since then, it has been a defensive calamity and sometimes a lack of effort too. 16th Sparta Rotterdam E Despite having all the right tools for success, Sparta have not been maximising their potential at all. Keeping a host of fine players over the summer led to Jeroen Rijsdijk getting the sack because of the club’s high expectations. Maurice Steijn has returned to the club he left before joining Ajax, and so far has not experienced much joy. 17th Almere City D– Almere are struggling and are looking out of their depth at this level. New signings haven’t delivered and it seems a matter of time until the manager is changed. Six goals scored in 13 games is the worst record in the league, with 12 goals the next fewest in the Eredivisie. 18th RKC Waalwijk E A very poor disciplinary record, so it is no wonder they are bottom of the class! Six red cards is double their nearest ‘competitor’ this season in this regard. A lack of quality all of the pitch will mean a difficult year ahead. Writer/interviewer/YouTuber for Football-Oranje.

Football-Oranje's Michael, Mike and Abdul react to the Nations League ... Below is a round up of all the action from the four Eredivisie ties on Sunday. NEC Nijmegen 1-2 Utrecht Utrecht’s excellent start to the season continued on Sunday as they saw off NEC Nijmegen. After half an hour, Yoann Cathline opened the scoring for the visitors with a fine run and finish.  Just after the break, NEC equalised thanks to an incredible solo goal from Sontje Hansen, who raced from his own area into the opposition box before finishing. Utrecht restored their lead through Victor Jensen, whose header was misjudged by NEC keeper Robin Roefs.  NEC then laid siege to the Utrecht goal but they could not find the equaliser and Utrecht made it three wins in a row. Utrecht are second and NEC sits 9th. Sparta Rotterdam 1-2 AZ Alkmaar  Maurice Steijn’s second game in charge of Sparta also ended in defeat. A new look AZ saw Dave Kwakman, Kees Smit and Mexx Meerdink all start and they took the lead early on with an excellent long-range strike from Peer Koopmeiners. Sparta responded quickly and Tobias Luaritsen placed a shot past Jeroen Zoet to make it 1-1.  Patrick van Aanholt and Lauritsen then hit the woodwork for Sparta, who dominated the first half without taking the lead. The game seemed to be heading for a draw but Sven Mijnans popped up in the box to fire AZ to victory over his former team. AZ remains sixth while Sparta is 16th. Willem II 2-2 NAC Breda  Willem II scored a 98th minute penalty to earn a draw against NAC Breda. NAC Breda dominated the opening stages and it was no surprise when Leo Sauer made it 1-0 after half an hour. Before the break, Clint Leemans should have made it 2-0 but hit the post with the goal gaping.  Eight minutes into the second half, NAC did make it 2-0 as Leo Greiml headed in from a long throw-in by Jan Van den Bergh. Jesse Bosch quickly gave Willem II hope with a deflected strike. Willem II then poured forward as they looked for an equaliser and they thought they had it when Jeremy Bokila struck but VAR intervened and ruled it out for a handball. Then late into stoppage time, Terence Kongolo caused a foul in the box and Willem II got a penalty which Bokila converted. Willem II are 10th and NAC sits 11th. Ajax 2-0 PEC Zwolle Ajax recorded a victory over PEC Zwolle to keep up with Utrecht and PSV Eindhoven at the top of the table. PEC Zwolle had the better of the opening stages with Dylan Vente and Dylan Mbayo both going close. Around the half hour mark, Ajax took the lead with Brian Brobbey tapping in after good work from Kenneth Taylor and Davy Klaassen. PEC Zwolle remained a threat but Ajax doubled their lead after an hour with Josip Sutalo heading in.  Sherel Floranus had a goal disallowed for offside as PEC Zwolle could not find a way back into the game and they paid for wasting several chances. Ajax remains third while PEC Zwolle is in 14th. 63. GOAAALLL! JOSIPPP! 2-0!#ajapec pic.twitter.com/JdeRlDQCad Follow @Footballoranje_ on Twitter

The Spain international was a top target for Hansi Flick's side after playing a starring role during La Roja's Euro 2024 triumph. Williams netted a fine solo goal in the 4-1 win over Georgia in the round of 16, becoming the first player on record at the Euros (since 1980) to score, assist and complete 100% of his passes (46 from 46) in a game he started. The Athletic Bilbao forward was then named Player of the Match after finding the net in Spain's 2-1 victory over England in the final. Williams was expected to reunite with international team-mate Lamine Yamal at Camp Nou. It was reported he chose to remain with Bilbao after Barca were unable to guarantee his registration with LaLiga due to complying with the salary cap, but Masip - advisor to Laporta - has refuted those claims. ""If a player who is of your interest doesn't want to move, you don't have much leeway,"" he told El Chiringuito. ""There was not much you could do. ""It's hard for me to think that if you were going to sign Nico Williams, you wouldn't be able to register him.  ""Barca weren't going to pay €50 million or €60 million for a player if they weren't going to be able to register him.

Yamal starred for La Roja at Euro 2024 and has been exceptional for Barcelona so far this season.

Becker's first-half strike was enough to deal Hansi Flick just his second league loss in charge of the Blaugrana, as they allowed title rivals Real Madrid to make up ground at the summit. Becker beat Flick's aggressive offside trap in the 33rd minute, racing onto a Luka Sucic header before slotting a tidy finish just inside the post. With star winger Lamine Yamal absent due to a muscle injury, Barcelona struggled for chances after Robert Lewandowski saw an early strike chalked off for offside following a VAR review. In truth, La Real were unfortunate not to win by a greater margin. Mikel Oyarzabal missed a glorious chance following good work from Takefusa Kubo just before half-time, with the home skipper also drawing Inaki Pena into action in the second period.  They ultimately did not need a second goal, however, and the victory takes them eighth in LaLiga with 19 points, six adrift of the top four.

Since then, Barcelona have prevailed in six of their last seven trips to San Sebastián, and they’ll be looking to continue that streak on Sunday.  After starting the Hansi Flick era with three straight 2-1 victories, Barcelona headed into the September international break with a 7-0 thrashing of Real Valladolid, a momentous result that has set the tone for the opening weeks. 10 of Barcelona’s last 13 matches have featured at least four goals, with the Blaugranas scoring 3+ goals in each of their last seven. They are blowing away the competition, sitting six points clear of Real Madrid and 10 above Atlético Madrid thanks to a sensational attacking output that has seen them rack up 40 goals and win 11 of their first 12 league matches under Flick.   Raphinha isn’t the kind of man who forgets. When Barcelona fans took to social media to post doctored images of Athletic Club winger Nico Williams wearing the #11, Raphinha used that disrespect as fuel and has quickly emerged as one of the most in-form players in world football. Since beginning October with a goal and an assist vs. Young Boys, the Brazilian has racked up at least one goal contribution in each of his last six matches for Barcelona, including a hat-trick vs. Bayern Munich, a brace of assists vs. Alavés, and a goal and an assist vs. Real Madrid.   After setting up both of Barcelona’s first two goals in Serbia, Raphinha stretched Barcelona’s lead to three en route to a 5-2 drubbing of Red Star Belgrade on Wednesday. The signs are promising as he looks to find the back of the net for the fifth match in a row.  It has been just over a year since Real Sociedad finished fourth and ended a decade-long Champions League drought. Today, however, the Basque side find themselves in 11th place in LaLiga. What’s more, after losing 2-1 to Viktoria Plzeň on Thursday, they are currently outside of the 24 Europa League knockout playoff spots.   So far this season, Imanol Alguacil’s side have actually done better on the road than at home. Whilst they’ve won four away matches this season, their sole home win out of seven attempts came on September 28 in a 3-0 thrashing of Valencia. The odds are not in their favour as they take on a Barcelona side that seems to be cruising to a second LaLiga title in three years.  Barça have won seven of their last eight matches vs. La Real, and there’s no reason to believe that pattern will not continue on Sunday.

The German coach now adopts a far more cautious approach when it comes to squad rotation, changing at most, two members of the personnel per game. The Barça manager is expected to do the same for Sunday’s away game against Real Sociedad with the German hinting that Lamine Yamal is due a rest with the teenager missing out on first team training on Saturday.  Pau Cubarsí is expected to start despite having nine stitches in a cut sustained in Belgrade and Dani Olmo may start despite the player also missing out on Saturday’s training session due to gastroenteritis. Despite the minor tweaks, Flick will field a very competitive team at the Real Arena with Iñaki Peña to remain between the posts, and despite conceding two goals in Belgrade, the young keeper still has the full confidence of the German coach. Few changes are expected at the back especially if Cubarsí‘s availability is confirmed but early signs point to Alejandro Balde returning to the left flank after being substituted in the Champions League with both Íñigo Martínez and Jules Koundé are fixed in the starting eleven. Real Madrid Soccer In midfield, Pedri and Marc Casadó will start, with the possibility of Fermín returning to the starting line-up, although Frenkie de Jong cannot be ruled out either.  In attack, there are also two immovable names at the moment: Robert Lewandowski and Raphinha, who are also the team’s top scorers, with 19 and 12 goals, respectively. The third attacking force could be Dani Olmo, assuming he recovers from the stomach bug with Ansu Fati a potential replacement for the former Leipzig player.

Yamal has been training alone in an attempt to recover after a hectic schedule for the Blaugrana. Pau Cubarsi is in contention, however, after suffering a facial injury in Wednesday's 5-2 Champions League win at Red Star Belgrade. Cubarsi participated in a full training session with the team, though 17-year-old Yamal was not present. ""Lamine was inside and he did specific strength training. He has had a lot of matches in the last few weeks so we took care of him and let him [train separately] indoors. We will see what his situation is tomorrow,"" Flick told reporters on Saturday. Flick heaped praise on Robert Lewandowski, who has scored 19 goals in 16 appearances across all competitions. ""He is in very good shape. I am also impressed with how he helps the defence. For me, there are no thoughts about giving him a rest,"" he added.

La Real have fared better on the road, collecting 11 of their 15 points away and losing four of their six home matches, with their only victory in front of their own fans coming against lowly Valencia.

Lamine Yamal may not be fit to feature for Barcelona against Real Sociedad in Sunday's LaLiga clash, says head coach Hansi Flick. Yamal has been training alone in an attempt to recover after a hectic schedule for the Blaugrana. Pau Cubarsi is in contention, however, after suffering a facial injury in Wednesday's 5-2 Champions League win at Red Star Belgrade. Cubarsi participated in a full training session with the team, though 17-year-old Yamal was not present. ""Lamine was inside and he did specific strength training. He has had a lot of matches in the last few weeks so we took care of him and let him [train separately] indoors. We will see what his situation is tomorrow,"" Flick told reporters on Saturday. Flick heaped praise on Robert Lewandowski, who has scored 19 goals in 16 appearances across all competitions. ""He is in very good shape. I am also impressed with how he helps the defence. For me, there are no thoughts about giving him a rest,"" he added.

The Portuguese was taking charge of his first home game after overseeing a 1-1 draw at Ipswich Town, and he would have been fearing the worst when a quickfire double from the visitors cancelled out Alejandro Garnacho's first-minute opener. But Norwegian forward Hojlund bagged either side of half-time to earn all three points and leave United a point off the top eight in the league phase. United were ahead inside 50 seconds when Hojlund caught Nikita Haikan dawdling, allowing Garnacho to tap into an open goal on the follow-up. Hakon Evjen bent in a beautiful left-footed equaliser and four minutes later Tyrell Malacia - back playing for the first time in 17 months - was outmuscled by Philip Zinckernagel, who then rifled one into the bottom-left corner. Shortly before the break, Hojlund restored parity on the volley after brilliantly taking down Noussair Mazraoui's dinked cross and then finished a well-worked move from six yards when meeting Manuel Ugarte's centre five minutes after the restart. Garnacho wasted two favourable opportunities when breaking in behind, before bending another effort high and wide after a four-on-two break. Marcus Rashford also flashed wide as United sought to add breathing space but, in the end, winning by the odd goal in five was enough to get Amorim a first win as boss. Data Debrief: Ruben up and running with a touch of coincidence Amorim can breathe a little sigh of relief with his United victory. This fixture marked only the second time a side had ever scored two goals inside 23 minutes in an away major European game against the Red Devils.

It could hardly have been a better start to the game for the new boss with Garnacho scoring after 48 seconds, though. It saw United score in the opening minute of a major European game for the first time since March 1991, when Brian McClair netted the opener against Montpellier in a UEFA Cup Winners' Cup tie.

It is fair to say that the Portuguese’s debut did not go as planned with Ipswich dominating for most part of the match, while Manchester United‘s misfiring attack continues to underperform as they recorded a low xG (0.90), which is one of Amorim’s many tasks to solve.   Now, a home debut awaits Amorim under the Old Trafford lights in the Europa League and the possibility to secure his maiden win at the helm arises in front of the Red Army, which will surely welcome the so-called ‘Smiling One’ with open arms. Bodø/Glimt are coming to the Theatre of Dreams in the first-ever competitive match between Manchester United and a Norwegian club in UEFA’s club competitions, which seems quite astonishing given the club’s recent trips to Norway during their pre-season summer tours. The Bodø-based club are coming to Manchester on the back of a win (0-2) in the penultimate round in Eliteserien, and ahead of a season-defining clash in Norway’s top-tier on Sunday as the Kjetil Knutsen-led squad host Lillestrøm, while second-placed Brann play third-placed Viking in the final round too. With only a point separating the reigning Norwegian champions from Brann and only three points ahead of Viking, it is fair to say that Glimt may have one eye on the weekend.   It was not all doom and gloom for Amorim at Portman Road as Luke Shaw made his comeback after spending 280 days on the sidelines, and additionally, Tyrell Malacia made the matchday squad, which is a huge boost for the Red Devils ahead of the hectic Christmas period. However, the wonderkid – Leny Yoro was not part of the squad, despite the Frenchman taking part in full training and the match against Glimt might be the perfect opportunity for him to finally make his debut. Harry Maguire, Victor Lindelof and Lisandro Martinez remain on the sidelines, with the latter the closest to making a comeback in a couple of weeks. As for the Scandinavian visitors, it will be interesting to see whether the coach, Knutsen will rest some of his key players given the club’s title defence is on the line and the fact that Glimt have had a superior start to the Europa League’s campaign than United, sitting in 12th place with a point ahead of the hosts who found themselves in 15th place.  Jens Petter Hauge made the step to Europe’s top 5 leagues too soon with his move to AC Milan a few years ago, but the 25-year-old’s talent and ability are undeniable as the playmaking winger continues to impress in the yellow of Glimt. With seven goals and five assists in Norway’s top-tier and a couple of goals and one assists in the Europa League, the Red Devils’ defence must be aware of his threat coming in from the left. Also, given the fact that Amorim favoured Amad Diallo at right wing-back over a natural defender against Ipswich, that might be where Glimt can look to exploit the hosts vulnerabilities.   The Red Devils are on an unbeaten five-match run in all competitions under Ruud van Nistelrooy and Amorim, respectively, and the expectation will be that this is a good chance for their new charismatic coach to pick up a maiden win. However, Bodø/Glimt are a quality side, and they have already defeated FC Porto this season, which Manchester United failed to do, and Jens Petter Hauge & co. are especially dangerous on the counter.

It is fair to say that the Portuguese’s debut did not go as planned with Ipswich dominating for most part of the match, while Manchester United‘s misfiring attack continues to underperform as they recorded a low xG (0.90), which is one of Amorim’s many tasks to solve.   Now, a home debut awaits Amorim under the Old Trafford lights in the Europa League and the possibility to secure his maiden win at the helm arises in front of the Red Army, which will surely welcome the so-called ‘Smiling One’ with open arms. Bodø/Glimt are coming to the Theatre of Dreams in the first-ever competitive match between Manchester United and a Norwegian club in UEFA’s club competitions, which seems quite astonishing given the club’s recent trips to Norway during their pre-season summer tours. The Bodø-based club are coming to Manchester on the back of a win (0-2) in the penultimate round in Eliteserien, and ahead of a season-defining clash in Norway’s top-tier on Sunday as the Kjetil Knutsen-led squad host Lillestrøm, while second-placed Brann play third-placed Viking in the final round too. With only a point separating the reigning Norwegian champions from Brann and only three points ahead of Viking, it is fair to say that Glimt may have one eye on the weekend.   It was not all doom and gloom for Amorim at Portman Road as Luke Shaw made his comeback after spending 280 days on the sidelines, and additionally, Tyrell Malacia made the matchday squad, which is a huge boost for the Red Devils ahead of the hectic Christmas period. However, the wonderkid – Leny Yoro was not part of the squad, despite the Frenchman taking part in full training and the match against Glimt might be the perfect opportunity for him to finally make his debut. Harry Maguire, Victor Lindelof and Lisandro Martinez remain on the sidelines, with the latter the closest to making a comeback in a couple of weeks. As for the Scandinavian visitors, it will be interesting to see whether the coach, Knutsen will rest some of his key players given the club’s title defence is on the line and the fact that Glimt have had a superior start to the Europa League’s campaign than United, sitting in 12th place with a point ahead of the hosts who found themselves in 15th place.  Jens Petter Hauge made the step to Europe’s top 5 leagues too soon with his move to AC Milan a few years ago, but the 25-year-old’s talent and ability are undeniable as the playmaking winger continues to impress in the yellow of Glimt. With seven goals and five assists in Norway’s top-tier and a couple of goals and one assists in the Europa League, the Red Devils’ defence must be aware of his threat coming in from the left. Also, given the fact that Amorim favoured Amad Diallo at right wing-back over a natural defender against Ipswich, that might be where Glimt can look to exploit the hosts vulnerabilities.   The Red Devils are on an unbeaten five-match run in all competitions under Ruud van Nistelrooy and Amorim, respectively, and the expectation will be that this is a good chance for their new charismatic coach to pick up a maiden win. However, Bodø/Glimt are a quality side, and they have already defeated FC Porto this season, which Manchester United failed to do, and Jens Petter Hauge & co. are especially dangerous on the counter.

Can the Giallorossi notch their third straight win in all competitions?  In nearly any other year, an away fixture against lowly Como wouldn't give Roma fans much pause. However, nothing has been easy for the Giallorossi in this most chaotic of seasons. From multiple managerial changes to missed calls to the usual spate of injuries, Roma has faced a continuous uphill battle in 2024. But there is hope on the horizon. After kicking off this third stint in charge of Roma with two predictable defeats to Napoli and Atalanta, Claudio Ranieri is slowly but surely rebuilding the Giallorossi's confidence. Between those two domestic defeats came an impressive 2-2 draw against Tottenham in London, which, coupled with the club's back-to-back victories over Lecce and Braga, has Roma back on the right foot. If Ranieri can keep the good times rolling today in Como, Roma has a good chance at heading into the holiday break riding a five-match heater, provided they can topple Sampdoria and Parma next week.

On Sunday, Claudio Ranieri’s Roma travels to Italy’s lake region to take on top-flight newcomers Como. And the Giallorossi will be riding their first back-to-back wins since last season, so Ranieri will want to get his line-up selections right as he tries to turn this into an actual winning streak against the struggling Northerners.  Ranieri will be without his two most experienced midfielders, Bryan Cristante (ankle) and Leandro Paredes (fever), who were left off the squad list for this match.    I convocati per #ComoRoma#ASRoma pic.twitter.com/DSfp2n1A5a The absence of those two means that Niccoló Pisilli should be in line to start next to Manu Koné in the center of the park. It’s expected that those two will be flanked by Angeliño and Saud Abdulhamid—who is coming off back-to-back strong performances on Roma’s right flank. Ranieri is expected to continue with the 3-4-2-1 formation that has created plenty of offense over the last two matches (seven goals). In those matches, Roma started Paulo Dybala as a false nine, which seems likely to continue with Artem Dovbyk starting from the bench.  If that is indeed the case, Dybala will likely be supported by Thursday’s standout performer—captain Lorenzo Pellegrini—and Alexis Saelemaekers. Mario Hermoso came off the bench to score Roma’s third and final goal on Thursday against Braga. However, it’s expected that Ranieri will run back the trio of Gianluca Mancini, Mats Hummels, and Evan Ndicka from the opening whistle.

Don’t look now, but the Giallorossi are finally starting to string together some good performances. While Roma is still only in twelfth place, their last two matches across all competitions were emphatic wins, defeating Lecce and Sporting Braga by three-goal margins. Claudio Ranieri’s start to his third stint with Roma might have been rough going, but thankfully I Lupi now have a run of matches against slightly weaker competition that might just allow them to climb up the standings. With that in mind, tomorrow’s match against Como doesn’t have the highlight-reel potential of earlier clashes against Napoli and Atalanta, but given the fragile nature of this squad, I’m perfectly fine with that. Roma needs to rediscover itself, and going up against dangerous opponents now would probably just send the Giallorossi back to square one. Roma needs to build confidence and consistency—two qualities they’ve sorely lacked this season. Tomorrow is a chance for Roma to prove that their recent wins weren’t flukes but the beginning of a much-needed revival. Paulo Dybala has often struggled for fitness; it’s the price you pay for having such a talented player in your squad. Yet recent matches have given the Giallorossi one of their longest streaks of consecutive matches from La Joya, and tomorrow’s match will give them their fifth match with him in a row—the longest streak he’s had since January. According to Corriere dello Sport, Ranieri is leaning toward Dybala to lead the line over Artem Dovbyk, who’s still recovering full fitness. While Dovbyk’s physicality and ability to stretch defenses are certainly key assets, it’s a good sign that Ranieri trusts Dybala’s creativity and killer instinct to unlock Como’s compact backline early on. Moreover, this match presents a prime opportunity for Dybala to build confidence and rhythm. If Dybala can stay fit and maintain form, he might just be the catalyst Roma needs to climb up the standings and mount a serious challenge in the Coppa Italia. As goes Dybala, so goes Roma; his ability to influence matches with a moment of brilliance could be the difference between a resurgent campaign and another season of missed opportunities.  This has been a transformative week for Saud Abdulhamid. Prior to Roma’s match against Sporting Braga, many Romanisti thought that Abdulhamid was a long-term project at best; the jump from Al Hilal to Roma is a huge one, and his lack of playtime and form to date wasn’t terribly surprising. But that match against Braga night changed the narrative in a big way. Not only did Abdulhamid become the first Saudi player to score in a European competition, but he also delivered a mature and assured performance that sparked a fair amount of excitement. Suddenly, the question isn’t whether Abdulhamid can adapt to life in Serie A—it’s whether he could be Roma’s long-term solution at right-back. The timing couldn’t be better for Abdulhamid to stake his claim. Zeki Celik has struggled for consistency his entire time in Rome, leaving Claudio Ranieri searching for alternatives on the right flank. According to La Repubblica, Abdulhamid will likely be rewarded for his midweek heroics with another start in Sunday’s match against Como. Playing as a right wing-back in Ranieri’s 3-5-2 system, he’ll have another opportunity to showcase the energy, defensive solidity, and attacking instincts that were on full display against Braga. If Abdulhamid can deliver another standout performance, he could cement himself as a short-term fix and a cornerstone for Roma’s future. If he can be that solution, it will simplify Roma’s January mercato planning. Instead of desperately needing a new starting right-back, Roma can focus on building out depth at striker and maybe even finding a long-term solution at left-back—something Roma needs just as much as they need a starting right-back.

Speaking to the press in the build-up to Saturday’s Premier League clash against Fulham via Calciomercato, the Dutchman confirmed the former Juventus winger lacks regular first-team action. Chiesa left Turin to join Liverpool in a £10 million deal in the summer after being deemed surplus to requirements by new Juventus manager Thiago Motta. However, he has only collected 78 minutes on Merseyside this season across three cameo appearances.  Low in the pecking order, Chiesa could soon request a transfer, with several Serie A clubs vying for his signature. In addition to long-term admirers Inter, Milan and Roma are keen on bringing the unsettled Reds star back to his homeland.  “What he needs is to play, the problem is that if he hasn’t played for five or six months, sometimes it’s difficult for a coach to give him his first minutes because you don’t exactly know what to expect,” Slot said about Chiesa.  “Yes, I see him on the training pitch, but ideally, it would be better to see him in a friendly during the week, or in an Under-21 match or something like that. But this is not our situation: we play so many matches. So maybe the game against Southampton could be a good moment for him to get some minutes on the field, and then we’ll know a bit better what we can expect from him.  “If you only have training sessions, it’s not the same as game time. You need game time to reach certain levels of fitness. But if you are fighting for the championship and fighting in the Champions League, it’s not always easy to find these minutes unless sometimes we are ahead 4-0 or 5-0, but I think that has only happened once all season.“ Chiesa has lost his place on the national team. Leaving Liverpool could increase his chances of regaining Luciano Spalletti’s trust, so a January return to Italy could be a genuine possibility for the versatile forward.

According to Sky Sport via Calciomercato, the Roma loanee left the hospital on Friday afternoon after recovering from cardiac arrest.  Bove underwent surgery on December 10 for the implantation of the removable subcutaneous defibrillator. The subcutaneous defibrillator implanted is removable, and Bove will have the option to keep it or have it removed based on the results of future medical evaluations. The 22-year-old collapsed on the pitch in a Serie A meeting between Fiorentina and Inter on December 1. Heart-stopping moments at Stadio Artemio Franchi sent shockwaves through the football community in Italy and abroad.  Quickly after being admitted to the hospital, the Fiorentina youngster spent a couple of days in the intensive care unit of Careggi before being transferred to the UTC. Thankfully, Bove has fully recovered and is ready to return to Viola Park to greet his teammates and manager, Raffaele Palladino. However, Bove’s career in Serie A is over. He will no longer be allowed to compete in professional sports in Italy, mirroring the case of Christian Eriksen, who had to leave Inter in 2021.  The Fiorentina starlet must wait to receive comprehensive documentation from his tests, which will determine whether his myocarditis is genetic or inflammatory in origin, helping to assess the potential risks he might face moving forward. As for Fiorentina, they’ll likely dive back into the market this winter to strengthen Palladino’s midfield options amid La Viola’s incredible season in Serie A.

We want to do it in advance and be very coherent. The two things are intertwined. The sooner the better. I don’t know whether it’ll be an Italian or a foreigner, but his identity is important.” According to Sky (via Tuttomercatoweb), Roma contemplating some elite choices. They covet Massimiliano Allegri, who denied past links and will take his time. The Giallorossi are testing the waters for Carlo Ancelotti, who’s not certain to stay at Real Madrid past this campaign. He previously voiced his desire to helm the capital club before retiring after playing for it for eight years. La Lupa is also keen on Vincenzo Montella, who was a candidate to take over midseason. However, the timing wasn’t right to poach him from Turkey. He already helmed them earlier in his career. The current ownership has tried with a middle-of-road foreigner, a big personality a little over the hill, an up-and-comer who was ousted too soon, and that bridge seems to have been burned for good, and a gritty manager who had done well in the minnows. It’s hard to find anybody with no drawbacks and who would have universal acclaim, but that should be the goal. They’ll be able to lure a big name with their spending.

By virtue of their 3-0 over Braga in the Europa League yesterday, Claudio Ranieri and Roma accomplished something the Giallorossi hadn't managed since last April: They won two matches in a row. Yes, my dear friends, it's been eight grueling months since the capital club won back-to-back matches. Last April, under Daniele De Rossi's watchful eye, the club won three consecutive matches in the middle of that month before floundering, winning only two of their final nine matches in all competitions. Time will tell whether Ranieri can use these victories as a springboard to greater success, but as we prepare to close the books on this terrible, horrible, no-good, very bad year, he has the club trending in the right direction—at long last.

   Thanks to yesterday's victory, Roma will qualify for the Europa League Knockout Phase Play-offs, giving the Giallorossi a chance to extend their European adventure into 2025. However, before we fret about Roma's path to the Knockout Phase, let's pass out some halos! The leader in the clubhouse for players most likely to be sold for a substantial profit this summer, the 23-year-old French midfielder weathered the storm early this season and has emerged as the club's most effective midfielder. Going the full 90 again, Koné stuffed the stat sheet last night: Seven key passes, nine shot-creating actions, two goal-creating actions, six balls played into the final third, and two passes into the penalty area—all of which were game-highs for either club. Defensively, Koné went a perfect three-for-three in tackles while recovering five balls. It won't be long before we start seeing “Koné to Juventus,” “Manchester City Inquire About Koné,” or “Real Madrid to Bid for Koné” headlines, but for now, try and enjoy the show. This kid is a DYNAMO.  Roma's embattled vice-captain is quietly putting together a nice stretch and was integral in the club's victory last night. While Mancini was sound behind the ball, to the tune of two tackles and three clearances, he was surprisingly instrumental in the Giallorossi's attack. In 90 minutes, Mancini chipped in four key passes, including two big chances created per Sofascore,  while adding two balls into the final third, one into the penalty area, and even an accurate cross into the penalty area for good measure. While he's still wet behind the ears, Saud made a case for more playing time yesterday. Getting the start ahead of Zeki Celik, the 25-year-old Saudi Arabian international had a night to remember for Roma. In addition to scoring his first goal on the European continent, Saud showcased his speed and aggression against Braga, going two-for-two on dribbles and completing a game-high four progressive carries while contributing four key passes, five balls into the final third and chipping in seven shot-creating actions, second only to Koné. If the smile on his face and the warm embrace he received from Ranieri after scoring a cracking 10th-minute goal weren't indication enough, Pellegrini was able to breathe a sigh of relief last night. The subject of increasing scrutiny and transfer speculation, Roma's captain turned back the clock last night, turning in a vintage performance. In addition to his goal, Pellegrini added five shots on goal, four shot-creating actions, two progressive carries, and five recoveries to his tally.  It was another solid performance from the Ivorian, who, like Mancini, attacked nearly as much as he defended against Braga. In addition to helping Roma keep a clean sheet yesterday, Ndicka was instrumental in the passing game, racking up five shot-creating actions, two goal-creating actions, one key pass, and three balls played into the final third.  In 73 minutes, the German center-back put on another show for Giallorossi supporters, reeling off 13 defensive actions, including seven clearances and a last-man tackle. Hummels also added four shot-creating actions, five balls played into the final third, and six duels won to the mix. At this point, I think we may need to start considering handing him a new deal. He's showing zero signs of slowing down. It was a night for the marginalized in Rome. Much like Pellegrini and Mancini, Zalewski has been under enormous pressure this season, finding himself on the outside looking in as the club tries in vain to find a taker for the young Polish winger. But in 90 minutes against Braga, Zalewksi reminded us of what he could be: five shot-creating actions, three key passes, four progressive carries, and five defensive actions. It's probably not enough to secure his future with the club, but it's a reminder that he can be an effective piece when focused.  Considering how lopsided the scoreline was (and how much more it could have been), we'll stow away the pitchforks and head straight into our post-match purgatory. These fellas played well (really well, in some instances) but didn't stand out quite as much as their peers. That's it for today's Sinners & Saints, but check back with us this weekend when we break down the club's performance against Como.      Gambling Problem? Call 1-800-GAMBLER (1-800-426-2537).

He commented to Sky afterward. “You have to give everything to solve the problems in life. I surely needed this moment. It was nice to liberate myself today. I’m very happy about everything, to be honest. We’re on the right path. The team had a good display, and I hit the net. We got everything I wanted.” The midfielder addressed his recent benching. “It wasn’t easy, but we players are all alike, and getting minutes is important. It’s an outlet. I trusted Claudio Ranieri, and we talked. He knew me beforehand, as we had been in touch. I think that the choice paid dividends.” Pellegrini had even been linked with a potential departure. “There’s a lot of nonsense going around about me. We’re a team of lads that go on the pitch, practice, and try to do our best for Roma because that’s what matters the most to us. That’s even more the case for me. I’ve been labeled a coach killer, but that’s part of the job. I understand that I don’t let others know me too well since I’m reserved. People only need to know that I’m myself inside and out in front or behind the cameras, and that won’t change.” Pellegrini was quizzed about leaving the team. “I don’t think so. Lies don’t become the truth even if you tell them a thousand times. I’ll always prioritize what’s best for the team.

To get something wrapped during Zona Cesarini means to get it done in the last possible minute, right before a deadline, and often when there are not many chances left. It has become a common saying in modern Italian and, of course, draws its origin from a football field. The man who gave his name to the Zona is Renato Cesarini, an Argentine-Italian footballer who played in the Belpaese for six years between 1929 and 1935. He was born in Senigallia in the Marche region but moved to Argentina with his family soon after. That’s where he was raised, and where he started to play football as a midfielder or a striker. In 1929, he joined Juventus and was a key part of the Bianconeri lineup that became known as the Juve del Quinquennio – Juventus’ first winning dynasty that clinched the Scudetto five times in a row between 1930 and 1935. Now, Cesarini was a very good striker but not a phenomenal one. He would have likely not claimed his place in the history of Serie A, if it wasn’t for his peculiar ability to score…in the last minute! He did so twice in the space of a few days, and a journalist’s creativity did the rest. On December 13, 1931, Italy faced Hungary at the legendary Filadelfia Stadium in Turin for an International Cup matchup. Upfront, Vittorio Pozzo’s Azzurri lined up Cesarini. It was common practice back in the days to borrow Argentine players with Italian heritage. Italy took a double lead thanks to two more Argentine-born players, Julio Libonatti and Raimundo Orsi, but the Hungarians fought back and made it 2-2. Guess who came to the rescue for Italy on 90 minutes? But Cesarini had happened to score in the last minute even a few days earlier, making it 3-0 for Juventus in a league matchup against Alessandria. That was not a decisive goal, but apparently it was enough to get the trend noticed. When Roma’s Rodolfo Volk netted a last-gasp goal against Inter a few days after the Azzurri’s game, journalist Eugenio Danese found it appropriate to write that he had scored during “Cesarini Time”. The legend was born. Cesarini came back to Argentina after five seasons at Juve, during which he scored 46 games out of 128 caps. He might not have been the greatest striker to ever wear a black-and-white jersey but, as the Italian writer Alessandro Baricco once said about him, “When you manage to give your name to a piece of Time, you must have done something good in life.” Even the Serie A recognized that as, since 2016, the “Cesarini Trophy” is awarded to the player who scored in the latest minute during the previous league season… Your email address will not be published.

Earlier today, the midfielder was linked with a move to Galatasaray and there were suggestions that his relationship with Claudio Ranieri wasn’t turning out to be great. But the midfielder scored in the win and did well, breaking his duck for the Giallorossi. After the game, he was asked about his future and in certain terms, he stated that he will not leave. He told Sky, as relayed VoceGiallorossa: “I don’t think so. Beyond the stupidities that remain such that they mean little to me, I think about the good of Roma and if the good of Roma is that I stay here, I will stay here.” There has been talk about how Pellegrini is a ‘coach eater’ and he was asked about the suggestions. He said: “I am not one who lets people know me well, I am a reserved person. What people need to know is that I am myself both on and off the pitch. I like being like this and I will certainly remain like this.” When asked about how he has solved his problems, Pellegrini said: “This period has certainly helped me and today it was so nice to free myself a bit. I’m happy because we’re continuing on the right path, then my goal came and the team’s performance. If you had asked me how I wanted the match to go I would have answered you this way.” It was Pellegrini’s first goal of the season today and it would come as big relief, considering all the issues and criticism he has faced.       Kaustubh Pandey I GIFN @2024 - All Rights Reserved.

Well, that’s more like it, isn’t it? Roma brushed aside Sporting Braga with a commanding 3-0 win that could have been even more lopsided, all while looking like a team. Yes, an actual team. Remember those? Cohesion, structure, players knowing where to be and what to do? Claudio Ranieri’s Roma might not be perfect, but they’re looking better every week—and tonight, they were streets ahead of their Portuguese opposition. Let’s start with the obvious: Lorenzo Pellegrini. The captain was at the heart of everything good Roma did tonight, running the show from midfield with the kind of composure and energy that’s been sorely missed. After weeks of looking like a player carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders, Pellegrini rediscovered his shooting boots as he rifled home a clinical opener to settle nerves early on. “He’s getting back to his usual excellent self,” Ranieri said pre-match, and judging by this performance, that might be an understatement. But Pellegrini wasn’t the only standout. Abdulhamid—or should I say the Saudi Cafu?—finally seems to be finding his feet. His goal to double Roma’s lead in the 47th minute was as towering as his defensive presence throughout. By the time Mario Hermoso put this one to bed with a stoppage time goal, Romanisti had to start thinking that good vibes might just be back on the menu. Of course, it’s still early days in the Ranieri Renaissance. Ranieri admitted as much today, stating that “We’re at the beginning of the story.” But for the first time in a while, this story—this mix of veteran stability and youthful promise—feels like one that just might be worth sticking with. Players like Matias Soulé, who Ranieri dubbed “the future,” might not have starred tonight, but their time will come. And while Tommaso Baldanzi did not appear, the squad’s depth and team cohesion are promising signs for what’s to come. It certainly feels like a night-and-day shift from the nadir of the Ivan Jurić era. Next up for the Giallorossi comes a trip to beautiful Como. This one be a different test entirely, more in line with Roma’s last Serie A match against Lecce. For now, though, let’s savor this win. After all, for the first time in forever, Roma aren’t just winning—they’re playing like a team. Ranieri promised to give Roma fans reasons to dream again, and if tonight’s performance is anything to go by, he’s delivering. Gambling Problem? Call 1-800-GAMBLER (1-800-426-2537). Hope is here.

The Giallorossi want their captain to react to his present difficulties before starting to discuss an extension, Corriere dello Sport informed. He hasn’t been fielded in the last three games, primarily because he’s not in the right headspace rather than because of his previous performances. He had been a regular under both Daniele De Rossi and Ivan Juric. On the other hand, his displays have been hit-or-miss. He has logged just 2 assists in 15 matches, failing to score. Roma will assess how things are going on the pitch for Pellegrini before making the call about his deal and future in general. Galatasaray would be ready to sign him in January already if the Giallorossi leaned in that direction. They are no strangers to luring Serie A stars. The Turkish side would be open to both a loan and a permanent deal. They have informed the entourage of the midfielder that they’d be willing to cover his €6M wages entirely. What’s been happening to him in the last couple of seasons, or even longer, is a bit mysterious from the outside. While he’s rarely been superb for prolonged stretches, the ostracism by the fan base goes beyond that. It’d be tough to show well for any player in this situation, even more so for him considering all the emotional baggage. In a standard situation, a team surely couldn’t afford to keep one of their best players on the bench. A dream for him to leave in January. Don’t let the door hit you on the way out.

[Artem] Dovbyk and Celik are both available for selection.” With that, Claudio Ranieri confirmed that he will have almost his complete roster at his disposal when Roma hosts Braga later today in a crucial Europa League match. The prevailing thought from media outlets around the peninsula is that Matías Soulé will be given a chance to start today. He’s a player Ranieri was asked about in his prematch presser.  “Soulé is the future. After a fantastic season at Frosinone, he joined Roma and thought he could do the same things. People know him a bit better now, and changing clubs affected him a little, but he’s a player I’m counting on, and Roma are counting on. He looks good to me. We’ll try to get the best out of him.” And while he didn’t commit to Soulé starting in that response, it seems like the Argentine could be given a shot. That could mean resting Paulo Dybala after he played 90 minutes on Sunday. Ranieri was asked about his handling as well.  “As you know, the night before every match, I reflect on the training sessions we’ve had and the previous game. I’ll need to speak to some of the players to understand things. This game against Braga is important but so is the next one against Como, so I have to decide what the best thing is.” Joining Soulé in attack is expected to be striker Artem Dovbyk, who missed out on Sunday with the flu. Ironically, Roma scored four times without their starting #9, who hasn’t rippled the back of the net in over a month.  “I think the main thing is he needs to get back into the good physical shape he was in before. He had injury problems then flu, and with a body like his, he struggles more than a player of a smaller stature. Then, of course, we need to figure out how to give him the service he needs. I’ve explained it, and I’ve shown it, but he needs to work for it too. I think his first goal should be to get back to 100% because a player with his build can’t perform well unless he’s 100% fit. We’ll try to get him back into shape, and the better we get to know him and the more the team’s confidence grows, the more he’ll benefit.” There is some variability in some of the line-up projections from around the peninsula. However, one area where the starters seem to be fully agreed upon is the midfield where the trio of Manu Koné, Leandro Paredes, and Niccoló Pisilli will play.  In the back three, we could see Mario Hermoso after he made his return from injury over the weekend. But Ranieri was non-committal. “As I said, I’ll assess everything tonight. Tomorrow I’ll talk to the lads, then I’ll decide. I’m not worried. Some of them haven’t got 90 minutes in them yet, so I need to decide whether to play them from the start or off the bench.” On the wings, it looks like Angelińo will start again. Meanwhile, Alexis Saelemaekers will play on the right. If Ranieri decides to give Angeliño a rare rest, then Saelemaekers would shift left with Saud Abdulhamid on the right.

According to Sky Sport via Calciomercato, Marco Baroni’s men are contemplating a winter bid for the unsettled Ajax midfielder. Tahirovic, who joined Roma from Vasalunds IF in 2021, left the Stadio Olimpico last summer to team up with the Dutch powerhouse. However, the 21-year-old has fallen out of favor with manager Francisco Farioli and is now keen on leaving Amsterdam. Lazio could be his next stop. Despite his past ties with Roma, the surprising Serie A title contenders are considering luring the Bosnia & Herzegovina international back to Italy. However, Lazio are not the only Italian club interested in capturing the services of the ex-Giallorossi playmaker.  After Edoardo Bove’s collapse against Inter earlier this month, Fiorentina are in the market for a new midfielder and could challenge Lazio for Tahirovic’s signature. In addition to Italian giants, Tahirovic has admirers in other European leagues. PAOK and Celtic are willing to fight Lazio and Fiorentina. Meanwhile, Ajax chiefs must be rubbing their hands. The Eredivisie outfit paid Roma €7.5 million to sign Tahirovic a year and a half ago and will aim to recoup their investment.  With a bidding war on the horizon, they’re well-positioned to maximize their gains. As for Lazio, they could use today’s UEFA Europa League encounter against Ajax as a pretense to gather information about the Bosnian starlet. Your email address will not be published.

Given Roma's struggles to begin the Serie A season, it's been easy to overlook the club's equally woebegone Europa League campaign. Roma has amassed a paltry six points through their first five EL fixtures, with their only victory coming against Dynamo Kyiv in late October. Sitting in 21st place in the newly revamped competition, Roma isn't likely to qualify for the Knockout Phase on their own merits but has a puncher's chance of backdooring their way into the next round via the Knockout Phase playoffs.  Whether you care about Roma progressing in Europe this season is a matter of personal conviction, but for his part, Claudio Ranieri wasn’t mincing his words, “We have to do well in the Europa League, Coppa Italia and Serie A. We have to give our all in every game – that’s our aim. We’ll see how we fare this season.” While Ranieri's pre-match presser ahead of tomorrow's tilt against Portugues side Braga was a bit light on specifics, the Tinkerman touched on a host of topics, including his future with the club. Here are some of the best bits from Wednesday's press conference. On his squad's fitness: “Everyone is fit except [Bryan] Cristante. [Artem] Dovbyk and Celik are both available for selection. Soule is the future. After a fantastic season at Frosinone, he joined Roma and thought he could do the same things. People know him a bit better now and changing clubs affected him a little, but he’s a player I’m counting on, and Roma are counting on. He looks good to me. We’ll try to get the best out of him.” Ranieri also discussed Dovbyk's current fitness levels and what he needs to be more successful on the pitch. “I think the main thing is he needs to get back into the good physical shape he was in before. He had injury problems then flu, and with a body like his he struggles more than a player of a smaller stature. Then of course we need to figure out how to give him the service he needs. I’ve explained it and I’ve shown it, but he needs to work for it too. I think his first goal should be to get back to 100% because a player with his build can’t perform well unless he’s 100% fit. We’ll try to get him back into shape, and the better we get to know him and the more the team’s confidence grows, the more he’ll benefit.” On lingering injuries and matchday decisions: “As you know, the night before every match, I reflect on the training sessions we’ve had and the previous game. I’ll need to speak to some of the players to understand things. This game against Braga is important but so is the next one against Como, so I have to decide what the best thing is...  Tomorrow I’ll talk to the lads, then I’ll decide. I’m not worried. Some of them haven’t got 90 minutes in them yet, so I need to decide whether to play them from the start or off the bench.” On his general match preparations and the fluctuating amount of running/effort in any given match: “The team had been coached well. Every coach has their own way of preparing for matches, and sees the game their own way. But if the team ran a lot against Napoli and on other occasions, like Atalanta and Tottenham – and I’m talking on a purely physical level, sometimes perhaps running a lot but not the right way – but if they did that it’s because they’d been trained for it beforehand. A coach can’t come in and make players run. They had been given the right preparation by previous coaches and fitness coaches. I’ve benefited from the previous work done and added my ideas about how I like the game to be played. Players are like sponges. Some coaches play a set way, some use different formations, some change formation mid-game, and the players are able to take on board what we want from them. Obviously that helps me a lot.” And finally, on Thursday's opponents: “Nowadays home advantage counts for little. Obviously the Roma fans are very passionate and really get behind the team but I expect to see a Braga side who know how to play football, in the Portuguese way with a European influence. I mean that can play direct, but can keep the ball too, can press, they have with good players – and I know [Joao] Moutinho as he was a player of mine. I expect a good game with two teams both trying to win.” Ranieri also touched on some longer-term issues, namely his role in tabbing his successor, saying simply, “We want a good coach. That’s it. Hopefully, we won’t get it wrong.” Date: December 12th Kickoff: 18:45 CET/12:45 EST Venue: Stadio Olimpico, Roma Referee: Daniel Seibert (GER) Gambling Problem? Call 1-800-GAMBLER (1-800-426-2537).

Along with Leandro Paredes and Alexis Saelemaekers, the German legend is enjoying new life under Claudio Ranieri.  Given the turmoil Roma has experienced this season, cycling through three managers in three months, we've hesitated to undertake any comprehensive assessment of the squad's performance. It's difficult to properly gauge how well a player performs when their roles, responsibilities, and even their position on the pitch have been in flux for the entire season. But that's simply the price one pays for organizational instability. While Claudio Ranieri has only notched one victory during his first four matches at the helm and one impressive draw on the road against Spurs in the Europa League, he's already brought much-needed stability to the Giallorossi. Win, lose, or draw, that was Ranieri's only mission in the early days of his third tenure with Roma: calm the noise and restore the club's confidence. Thanks to their rousing performance against Lecce last weekend, the Romaverse is brimming with positivity. For the first time in months, Roma fans have a reason to be optimistic. However, it is not just Ranieri's warm embrace that is turning the club around. His famously flexible tactics have already yielded positive results for the Giallorossi, with several players showing significant improvements compared to the uninspiring days under Ivan Juric.

   Ranieri isn't the type of manager who adopts one or two players as his pet project, but a trio of previously overlooked players—Leandro Paredes, Mats Hummels, and Alexis Saelemaekers — have found new life under his leadership. While Saelemaekers owed his early season ex-communication to a nasty ankle injury, the same cannot be said for his veteran counterparts. Paredes and Hummels were meant to provide stability on the pitch while Daniele De Rossi essentially learned the finer points of managing on the fly. However, once DDR was shown the door, they became almost inexplicably tied to Ivan Juric's bench, seldom, if ever, seeing the light of day. From starring in Borussia Dortmund's run to the Champions League final last season to languishing on the bench for two and a half months, Hummels’ situation was particularly vexing. The best course of action with Hummels required meticulously managing the soon-to-be 36-year-old's minutes, but ignoring him entirely bordered on negligence. Looking back on it, it seems absurd that a man with his CV couldn't get minutes for a suddenly middling club like Roma. Paredes, meanwhile, was no stranger to the ups and downs of life in the Eternal City. Still, after re-signing with the club in 2023 and logging nearly 4,000 minutes in all competitions under Mourinho and De Rossi last season (while also scoring five goals and adding seven assists), his place in Roma's midfield felt secure. Nevertheless, once the press-happy Juric took control, Lovely Leo and his delicate but deadly approach to defending the midfield fell by the wayside, ceding match time to everyone from Manu Koné to Enzo Le Fée to Bryan Cristante. The reasons for Roma's downfall this season extend well beyond these three players, but shoving aside someone as historically great as Hummels, a gifted passer like Paredes, and a jack-of-all-trades attacker like Saelemaekers furrowed more than a few brows in Rome.  Since Ranieri returned in late November, Hummels, Paredes, and Saelemaekers suddenly feel like pivotal pieces of the puzzle rather than the stray, tattered pieces that somehow always end up under the sofa. And the club's recent 2-2 draw with Spurs and their 4-1 shellacking of Lecce may provide a glimpse into Ranieri's plan for these three sudden stalwarts.

   Sitting in the middle of Ranieri's three-man defense, Hummels has become a one-man wrecking crew since joining the starting lineup against Spurs on November 28th. In those three matches (Spurs-Atalanta-Lecce), Hummels has racked up 34 defensive actions (including a 100% tackle success rate over the past two games), cleared 12 balls, and recovered 24 loose balls.  Mats Hummels vs Tottenham @matshummels pic.twitter.com/6aTARkme3i Put simply: Now that Hummels is healthy and match-fit, he's bringing a level of expertise and execution not seen on the Roma backline since Mehdi Benatia nearly a decade ago. To wit, in Roma's 4-1 win over Lecce last weekend, Hummels won/gained back possession in Roma's defensive third 11 times, the most of any Serie A player this season. Add in his game-tying goal against Spurs, and Hummels is putting a forgetful autumn in his rearview mirror. Paredes, meanwhile, has enjoyed a similar resurgence over the past several weeks. Starting each of the club's past three matches, Paredes has seen his share of touches (and influence) increase each week. With the ball at his feet, Lovely Leo has been doing his best Andrea Pirlo impression, calmly and continuously probing the midfield, looking for seams to overtake multiple defenders and create chances further up the pitch. Against Lecce alone, Paredes compiled more than 600 yards of progressive passing, more than double his closest competitor, while overtaking an average of 3.7 players per pass—the highest mark on either side. Beyond simply passing and moving, Paredes' creativity has shined during this three-match stretch: four key passes, nine shot-creating actions, and 23 balls played into the final third. Leandro Paredes  vs Tottenham  pic.twitter.com/7RFnMTJfab Beyond his passing numbers, Paredes is covering a lot of ground on the pitch, racking up 11 kilometers in Roma’s win over Lecce. But if simply running isn't your thing, try this on for size: Over this same three-match stretch, Paredes is leading all Roma players in total and progressive carrying distance. Any way you slice it, Paredes has been the beating heart in Roma's midfield since Ranieri replaced Ivan Juric late last month. While Saelemaekers has only recently returned from ankle surgery, his performances under Ranieri augur well for 2025. Against Lecce, Saelemaekers reeled off four attempts on goal, contributed one key pass and two shot-creating actions, attempted two dribbles, and scored the match's first goal. So, while the book on Saelemaekers remains a bit short, it's not difficult to project his role under Ranieri: he will flit around the final third, picking and choosing when to facilitate and when to attack directly. We're not even at the halfway point of the season, so chances are several other players will rise and fall under Ranieri's stewardship. Still, if late November and early December are any indication, Hummels, Paredes, and Saelemaekers will be critical as the Giallorossi scratch and claw their way back to respectability.

It’s the first time it has happened this season. The recent turn of events put him closer to obtaining an automatic extension from Roma, La Gazzetta dello Sport informs. The condition to activate it is for him to play in 50 percent of the games in the last three years since joining. He has to get the nod and play at least 45 minutes for his appearance to count against such a quota. At this point, Dybala has starred in 93 out of 129 matches, getting the call 72 times and staying on the pitch for at least a half on 69 occasions. Therefore, he’s currently at 53,5 percent. He’s on his way, but he needs to avoid significant injuries from here on out. There are 23 Serie A fixtures, at least 3 Europa League ones, and a Coppa Italia tilt left this season. If the Giallorossi were eliminated early in both cups, La Joya would have to be involved in just nine more games. Instead, he’d have to do it in 16 if they went all the way in all competitions. It’s ludicrous that after two seasons and change, which have gone well for him personally for the most part, there hasn’t been a real negotiation to renew his contract and do away with all these machinations, not even after his Saudi Arabia U-turn. It’s surely in the club’s interest at this point, as his salary will be almost unsustainably rich next year. Your email address will not be published.

The former Juventus coach is preparing for his comeback, but it’s not necessarily imminent. He won’t take over a team at all costs this campaign, Tuttomercatoweb informed. The gaffer was recently linked to West Ham, as Julen Lopetegui is on the hot seat. The Spanish manager has bought some time with the latest result. In any case, the ex-Bianconeri manager has rebuffed every approach so far. He’ll be back when he finds a project that fully convinces him, preferably during the offseason to shape the squad the way he prefers. Allegri won’t take over a team that’s in disarray or has turmoil behind the scenes. Roma and Saudi Arabia have been mentioned as future possibilities. Claudio Ranieri suggested him to the brass for 2025/2026. He attended an Azzurri-related event on Tuesday and was quizzed on the links (via Goal). “The Americans (who own the Giallorossi) didn’t call me. Studying English is going well.” The six-time Scudetto winner would like to be fully in control at his next stop rather than inherit somebody else’s work. He wishes to have the chance to do away with the label of being a defensive-minded manager. He’s willing but not eager to get back on the horse. It’d be a little surprising if he left Serie A, but stranger things have happened. Instead, it’d be a stunner if he was back midseason and not next summer. There’ll probably be a pair of enticing landing spots in Italy. Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked * Comment *  Name *  Email *  Website

Sometimes, impulsive behavior is the best behavior. A couple of weeks ago, I was looking at Roma’s schedule and saw the Giallorossi were playing the day before my 36th birthday (yes, Hummels, I’m as old as you) at the Stadio Olimpico vs. Lecce. It wasn't a big game like Inter, Lazio, or Juventus, but beggars can’t be choosers. Even though Ivan Juric was still our coach back then, and the team was in total shambles, I didn’t hesitate. I decided to go and support our beloved Roma in its darkest hour. I booked a flight, tickets for the Lecce game, and a nice, cozy apartment in the Prati district of Rome.  From there, it's a short 15-minute walk to the Piazza Del Popolo, a tram to stop Mancini, a short walk over the bridge Duca d’Aosta, past some stands with food and merchandise, and tada, the illuminated Olimpico right in front of you. Luckily, Juric had already left Rome, and I was glad that Ranieri got appointed as caretaker. It feels a bit more romantic. We love Claudio, and Claudio loves Roma; it all makes sense. Plus, now I get to see Spalletti and Ranieri in real life (albeit from afar), two of my favorite coaches. My first Olimpico experience was more than 8 years ago, in May 2016. Spalletti guided Roma to a convincing 3-0 win vs. Chievo Verona, thanks to goals from Radja, Rudiger, and Pjanic. DDR was captain, Salah played for us, and Totti got subbed in. Jup different times, I tell you. The game last Saturday wasn’t sold out, but there was quite an atmosphere at the Olimpico. As always, the famous ‘Roma Roma Roma’ anthem before the start, the cheers for Ranieri, and boos for Lecce. But I couldn’t help but feel people were afraid it would end in a frustrating draw or worse, another loss.  After all, Lecce under Marco Giampaolo was rejuvenated, winning against Venezia and holding Juve to a draw at home. Roma, on the other hand, was in a downright crisis. Six losses in their last seven Serie A games, two sackings, two points from relegation... Boy, I sure picked the right time to go to the Olimpico. There was no shortage of tension. Now, the game itself. It was, well, beautiful. I sat at the Tribuna Tevere Top Nord and saw a more convincing Roma—players with confidence, some nice slick passing, and Dybala hustling. Even though Lecce (undeservedly) scored the equalizer right before halftime, I just knew Roma would win this match if they kept this up. Lecce was poor, they rarely threatened Svilar, and Roma wasted a lot of chances.  The stadium exploded right after Mancini’s goal. There was an obvious relief felt in the entire Stadio. The celebrations after Pisili and Koné’s goals were probably heard to the center of Rome. Those goals were the icing on the cake. I also loved the interaction between the crowd and the commentator: NI-CO-LO... PI-SI-LIIII. MAN-CI-NIIII. Hummels was a beast in defense; I was really impressed by him. Paredes was our metronome in midfield, always calm and aware. Koné was the tireless engine. Saud once again started doubtful, but most fans around me actually supported the guy and were happy he got an assist. Pisili is clearly a fan favorite. Ryan Friedkin? Well, not so much. Once he was filmed, the stadium started whistling.  In the end, AS Roma won, and that’s the most important thing. We desperately needed this. Kudos to the cheerful Lecce crowd, by the way. Even though small in size, they made quite some noise even after being 2-1 and 3-1 down. It was everything I had hoped for and more. Honestly, Roma scoring four goals? Their biggest win of the season so far? Amazing. People were still chanting on the way back to the bus and tram. A perfect evening. This was exactly what the fans needed. The Italians who sat beside me at the Stadio even congratulated me for being Belgian after Saelemakers scored. Hey, no problem, ragazzi, that’s what Belgians do. We get the job done.  Ironically, Lecce and Chievo had some things in common. A Belgian opened the score (Radja & Saelemaekers), and Roma won with a three-goal difference. The Giallorossi played with a false nine (Perotti and Dybala), and SES started both matches. I guess I’m good juju for Roma. I just hope Roma are back on track after this win. My (financial) powers can only handle so much. My return was planned for Monday, so I spent the entire Sunday strolling around the city. The Vatican, Colosseo, Pantheon, Trevi, Castel Sant ‘Angelo,... There were mythical buildings, but honestly, nothing could compare to the vibe and joy of the Olimpico—not even the amazing Pasta Amatriciana I ate Sunday evening.  Grazie Roma. Until the next time.

Rasmus Hojlund scored twice to secure all three points for the Red Devils in Thursday's contest at Doosan Arena but not without a scare first. Goalkeeper Onana gifted the home side the lead after 48 minutes when he passed straight to Pavel Sulc, who teed up Matej Vydra to slide home. United captain Fernandes said there was no apportioning blame on Onana, who many felt was also at fault for Nottingham Forest's second in last weekend's 3-2 defeat at Old Trafford. Speaking to TNT Sports, Fernandes said: ""We want to play from the back. Everyone knows we have to make the right decision.  ""Andre missed the pass but it’s nothing we should focus on. It’s not about Andre making a mistake, we don’t look at individuals here. It’s about all the players involved and we have huge belief in Andre.  ""He knows he made a mistake, he’s a clever guy, we don’t need to tell him.

""It's something we’ve been doing for a long time. We know the goalkeepers are good on the ball, they can play.  ""We normally do it. It didn’t work this time but on many occasions it works. We trust Andre to keep doing the thing he thinks are best. Mistakes happen, and if mistakes happen, goals can happen."" United have played six matches under Ruben Amorim, winning three, losing two and drawing one with two of the victories coming in the Europa League. Hojlund said more time is needed for things to come together under the Portuguese. ""We still need more time. It’s very early days. But it’s about getting things together – it’s getting under the skin now,"" he said. ""We still need a lot of practice, a lot of time. We don’t have a lot of training so it’s about getting the practice in during the matches. It sounds a bit odd, but it’s the best way."" Bruno Fernandes insists he and his Manchester United team-mates have full belief in Andre Onana after his mistake in the 2-1 Europa League win over Viktoria Plzen. Rasmus Hojlund scored twice to secure all three points for the Red Devils in Thursday's contest at Doosan Arena but not without a scare first. Goalkeeper Onana gifted the home side the lead after 48 minutes when he passed straight to Pavel Sulc, who teed up Matej Vydra to slide home. United captain Fernandes said there was no apportioning blame on Onana, who many felt was also at fault for Nottingham Forest's second in last weekend's 3-2 defeat at Old Trafford. Speaking to TNT Sports, Fernandes said: ""We want to play from the back. Everyone knows we have to make the right decision.  ""Andre missed the pass but it’s nothing we should focus on. It’s not about Andre making a mistake, we don’t look at individuals here. It’s about all the players involved and we have huge belief in Andre.  ""He knows he made a mistake, he’s a clever guy, we don’t need to tell him.

Onana gifted hosts Plzen the lead in the 48th minute of Thursday's contest at Doosan Arena, when he passed straight to Pavel Sulc, who squared for Matej Vydra to tuck home. Yet Onana's blushes were spared thanks to Hojlund, whose winner came in the 88th minute. The Dane, who came on in place of the ineffective Marcus Rashford, was in the right place to tap in after Martin Jedlicka parried straight to him in the six-yard box. And after Mason Mount had seen two attempts saved by Jedlicka, Holjund reacted sharply from Bruno Fernandes' clever free-kick to drill home the late winner. Antony and Amad Diallo squandered opportunities for United to put the result beyond all doubt in stoppage time, but Ruben Amorim's team nevertheless got back to winning ways ahead of Sunday's Manchester derby. Data Debrief: Amorim in good company thanks to hotshot Hojlund Amorim is only the third United boss to win both of his first two matches in major European competition in charge of the club, after Matt Busby and Alex Ferguson. That is largely down to the efforts of super-sub Hojlund, who has been involved in 50% of United's goals in the Europa League this season (6/12), with the forward scoring (four) or assisting (one) each of United's last five goals in the competition. The Red Devils are now well placed to qualify for the last 16 of the Europa League, though Plzen were dreaming of a famous win when former Burnley forward Vydra put them ahead. Vydra has scored three goals in the Europa League this season; only Michael Krmencik (four) and Marek Bakos (four) have netted more goals for Plzen in a single campaign of a major European competition.

After being held by both Twente and Porto, United travelled to Turkiye requiring a win to ease the mounting pressure on boss Erik ten Hag. However, they were unable to hold on after Christian Eriksen gave them an early lead, with Youssef En-Nesyri heading a second-half equaliser to lift Fenerbahce to five points from three Europa League matches. Fielding a strong lineup, United went on the front foot early on and were rewarded after 15 minutes, Eriksen firing home after being fed by Joshua Zirkzee on the edge of the area. Marcus Rashford went close to doubling United's lead after cutting in from the left-hand side, but the Red Devils were indebted to Andre Onana for preserving their lead in the 39th minute. Onana got down to his right to claw En-Nesyri's header away, then sprung to his feet to tip the Moroccan's second effort away in an incredible double-save. En-Nesyri was not to be denied four minutes after half-time, though, getting between Victor Lindelof and Lisandro Martinez to direct Allan Saint-Maximin's cross past Onana. Fenerbahce wanted a penalty when Manuel Ugarte collided with Bright Osayi-Samuel, with Mourinho sent to the stands for his furious reaction to the challenge, but they largely failed to trouble United's goal after drawing level. The visitors were also unable to find a winner, Rashford missing their clearest chance when he could only prod Diogo Dalot's inviting cutback wide.  Data Debrief: Six of the worst for United United have now gone six games without victory in European competitions, drawing four and losing two, their longest such run since an identical streak between 1980 and 1983. They have won just one of their last 11 matches in Europe overall and are now without a win in their last three trips to Fenerbahce, losing two and drawing one. There was to be no statement victory for Mourinho, either.

He was amply supported in the transfer window too with new arrivals including loan deals for Allan Saint-Maximin, Sofyan Amrabat and Filip Kostić, and the Süper Lig’s most expensive player, Youssef En-Nesyri. The expectation, then, was no less than the club’s first league title in a decade. So far, things are not going smoothly, Fener were eliminated from the UEFA Champions League qualifiers at the hands of Lille, failed to win their domestic season-opener against newly-promoted Göztepe and worst of all, lost to city rivals Galatasaray in what was their first meeting of the season.   There already are murmurs of a negative environment in the dressing room, so the Portuguese tactician seems to be under pressure already. Especially in recent years, Mourinho has developed into much more of a cup expert, so he may well have to rely on his exploits in the Europa League to protect his position as long as possible.  The new format of the Europa League makes it so that two-thirds of the teams that enter the group stage will advance to the knockouts. So, it would take quite a catastrophic campaign for Manchester United to fail to advance, but they will be keen to register their first win of the season after drawing both their matches so far – against FC Twente and Porto. The Red Devils should aim for a top-eight finish to skip the first knockout round, which will be held in February, on what would be the Thursdays either side of a Premier League fixture against Tottenham Hotspur. United have had incessant injury issues dating back to last season, so the less congested they can make their fixture schedule, the better their chances will be of achieving something at the end of the season. At present, they will be without as many as seven first-team players for this fixture, so it will be a depleted squad that travels to Türkiye. They will also be without the suspended Bruno Fernandes.

Ten Hag faces one of his Old Trafford predecessors on Thursday when United visit Mourinho's Fenerbahce in the Europa League. The current United boss is a man under pressure after a difficult start to the season, despite delivering silverware in each of his first two seasons in England. Those were the Red Devils' first trophies since Mourinho was in charge, with the Portuguese leaving Manchester in 2018 and subsequently working at Tottenham, Roma and now Fenerbahce. Fener are now fourth in Turkey's Super Lig, eight points off the pace, albeit with a game in hand. But Ten Hag has faith in Mourinho, just as he does in his own ability to turn United's fortunes around. ""Mourinho and I, we won a lot of trophies the last years, but you have to prove yourself every year,"" the Dutchman said. ""When you don't win, we are always under criticism. ""We know that we are experienced enough. Professional football is about winning games, and when you don't win, the criticism is coming.

United have made hard work of winning two points across the same period, their European form no more impressive than domestic results, which have them 12th in the Premier League. Going back to last season's miserable Champions League campaign, United are winless in five European matches, their worst run since the 1980s. ""Man United didn't win in Europe [since Mourinho's Europa League win] and it's also for us a target, what we want to achieve, and we have a big opportunity this season,"" Ten Had added. ""We have the quality, we have to win games. It's a new set-up, we are two games under way, we have two points, we know what we have to do and win games. ""This season we just started, we have two draws. First season, I think we won a lot of European games. Last season, obviously it was for domestic and also in Europe a difficult journey.

The winger had not started a game for the Red Devils since October 3 but made the most of his opportunity by scoring twice in the second half following an insipid opening 45 from the hosts at Old Trafford. Amad's double was his first Red Devils brace, while five of his six goals in all competitions for United have come at Old Trafford.  Interim boss Van Nistelrooy, who has one more game in charge before handing over to Ruben Amorim after the international break, was full of praise for Amad, who also scored his first Europa League strikes since March 2021. Speaking to TNT Sports, he said: ""I think Amad made a difference for us today obviously, because of his goals, but he was sharp. ""I think in the first half he was also one of the few who was at his level. So well done to him, good game. ""He's been incredible (in training) actually, every time he was never affected by not playing, always training, always staying on the pitch, always saying 'Ruud let's do more'."" Amad's second goal was particularly brilliant as he won the ball back deep in PAOK territory, drove forward, and bent a lovely 20-yard effort into the left-hand side of the goal, albeit with a slight aid of a deflection. Van Nistelrooy added: ""He made his own goal. Coming inside with the left, getting inside the far post was excellent. ""But I think this is what made the goal, he won his own duel and then took the shot for the goal."" Diallo's impressive display saw him register more shots on target (three) and touches in the opposition box (10) than any other player on the pitch.  He also completed the most successful dribbles (two), while also competing in 16 duels during the contest, the joint-highest for the Red Devils along with Victor Lindelof. Diallo himself praised the work Van Nistelrooy has done since returning to Old Trafford as part of the backroom staff under previous manager Erik ten Hag in the summer.  ""Since he arrived at Manchester United he has been very important for everyone,"" he said.  Prior to their victory over the Greek side, United were winless in six consecutive European matches (D4, L2), matching their worst stretch since 1980 to 1983.

From a Dortmund perspective, the first half was very underwhelming. They struggled to create any meaningful chance to trouble Oliver Baumann in the Hoffenheim net, in fact, they had just one shot in the entire first half. Dortmund were awarded a penalty after what was originally deemed a foul on Serhou Guirassy from Arthur Chaves, but VAR, rightly, overturned the decision. For Hoffenheim, they also failed to have a shot on target but looked a lot more dangerous than Dortmund especially when they were going forward.  However, in the second half, Dortmund started very quickly when Giovanni Reyna scored his first Bundesliga goal in 582 days as he latched onto a poor clear from Hoffenheim. This trend did not last long as Hoffenheim continued to be the better side and Dortmund were unable to create any meaningful chances, shown by the fact they created no big chances in the whole game. Hoffenheim on the other hand continued to push for equalisers and they were rewarded late on when ex-Dortmund Jacob Bruun Larsen prodded home.  For Hoffenheim, the result was probably unjust as they would feel like they could have come away with the three points, which goes to show the positive work that Christian Ilzer has done since arriving from Sturm Graz. While Dortmund were not good and lacked any creative spark and were lucky to draw this game. The positive for Dortmund is that on his return from injury, Karim Adeyemi looked lively but he was still unable to make up for the lack of creative spark. Apart from that it is clear that Dortmund need more options in the creativity department as without Julian Brandt and Jamie Gittens not at his best today, Dortmund had nothing.  Gregor Kobel (5), Yan Couto (5), Emre Can (6), Nico Schlotterbeck (6), Ramy Bensebaini (6), Felix Nmecha (6), Pascal Groß (4), Maximilian Beier (4), Giovanni Reyna (6), Jamie Gittens (5), Serhou Guirassy (6) Others: Karim Adeyemi (6), Marcel Sabitzer (5), Kjell Wätjen (5), Julien Duranville (5), Yannik Lührs (-) Oliver Baumann (6), Valentin Gendrey (6), Arthur Chaves (4), Stanley N’soki (5), Alexander Prass (6), Tom Bischof (6), Anton Stach (6), Diadie Samassékou (4), Andrej Kramaric (6), Max Moerstadt (5), Adam Hlozek (5) Others: Jacob Bruun Larsen (6), Haris Tabakovic (5), Dennis Geiger (5), Paul Hennrich (-), Kevin Akpoguma (-) GGFN | Jack Meenan  @2023 - All Rights Reserved.

Nuri Sahin's side suffered a 3-2 defeat to Barcelona in the Champions League on Wednesday, a result that left them ninth in the league phase table with 12 points. The performance raised concerns about Dortmund’s defensive frailty, particularly their counter-attack susceptibility. BVB are currently in a challenging spell and has been winless in their last three matches. However, two of those games were against top-tier opponents in Barcelona and Bayern München. In the Bundesliga, their recent form is mixed, with two wins, two draws, and two losses in their last six matches. At home, Dortmund have faltered recently, going winless in their last two fixtures at Signal Iduna Park. However, they had won their previous eight home games, and the loss to Barcelona remains their only defeat at the stadium this season. Team News In encouraging news for Dortmund, forward Karim Adeyemi is expected to return after being sidelined since October. While his fitness may restrict him to a substitute role, he could feature in place of one of Donyell Malen, Marcel Sabitzer, or Jamie Gittens. However, Dortmund remain without attackers Julian Brandt and Maximilian Beier, who are sidelined with hamstring and knee injuries, respectively. Defensive options are also limited, with Nico Schlotterbeck, Niklas Süle, and Waldemar Anton all unavailable. This shortage may force Nuri Sahin to deploy midfielder Emre Can as a central defender alongside Ramy Bensebaini in a makeshift back four. As for the visitors, Hoffenheim, while only three points clear of 16th-placed Heidenheim, who currently sit in the relegation playoff spot, they will likely take some encouragement from their recent draw with Freiburg. The result marked a positive step after enduring three consecutive defeats in their prior outings. Hoffenheim, led by boss Christian Ilzer, came into the game following a 0-0 draw against FCSB in the Europa League on Thursday. The match saw both sides create three big chances, but neither could capitalise. In the Bundesliga, Hoffenheim have scored 18 goals and conceded 25, placing them 12th in offensive rankings and tying for the fourth-worst defensive record in the league. Their away form, however, has been a major concern, with the team failing to secure a win in their last ten road games, losing six and drawing four during this stretch. Team News For Hoffenheim, injuries have also similarly disrupted their squad. With Ozan Kabak, Florian Grillitsch, and Christopher Lenz all ruled out, Arthur Chaves and Stanley N’Soki are expected to start in central defence ahead of goalkeeper Oliver Baumann. In attack, Adam Hložek is likely to lead the line, supported by Andrej Kramarić, Tom Bischof, and Jacob Bruun Larsen, given the absences of Marius Bülter and Ihlas Bebou. Meanwhile, the midfield could feature a partnership of Anton Stach and Diadié Samassékou due to the unavailability of Grischa Prömel, Umut Tohumcu, and Finn Becker.",

The Sinsheim club enjoyed the lion's share of possession, but struggled to make their dominance count in the final third as the visitors from the Romanian capital held firm. Hoffenheim will likely end the night outside the twenty-four qualification places with two fixtures remaining. Christian Ilzer's men looked the likelier of the two teams to open the scoring as TSG spurned a decent chance on 3 minutes. Andrej Kramarić teed up Bruun-Larsen but the Dane fired wide from 14 yards. The game stumbled upon an uneventful patch until the 36th-minute when Steaua constructed a fine opportunity. Darius Olaru fed Adrian Sut, however the midfielder's effort met Oliver Baumann's midriff. A final header from Jacob Bruun-Larsen was off target before the break.  Maximilian Moerstedt was introduced by Ilzer for the start of the second-half as Adam Hložek's evening came to an end. However the game continued in a rather scrappy manner with yellow cards aplenty. David Miculescu picked up a caution for the visitors while both Arthur Chaves and Maximilian Moerstedt were equally brandished with the yellow warning after duels with Tanase and Popescu respectively. Hoffenheim suddenly awoke from their slumber after the hour and increased the tempo. Anton Stach spurned a gilt-edged opportunity as he skied a Pavel Kadeřábek cross, meanwhile Stefan Tarnovanu was equal to Moerstedt's header in the following sequence. Ultimately, the revival would be shortlived as Bucharest were content to take the point on the road while a night of inaccuracies cost Hoffenheim dearly. ",

After a dramatic comeback win over Leipzig in Ilzer's debut, Ilzer's Kraigauer failed to score a goal in three straight losses. A 1-1 draw against Freiburg on Sunday at least snapped the losing and scoreless skid. There remains plenty of room for improvement in Ilzer's squad. Many German footballing pundits have called into question his not-entirely-convincing style of personnel management. In five matches under Ilzer, the team has only held the lead for three minutes in a total of 450 minutes of football. The last Europa League outing proved an absolute unmitigated disaster. Hoffenheim's Romanian guests have amassed double the amount of points (10) as their host through five Europa League rounds. FCSB roll into Sinsheim on a five-game unbeaten-run and have won three on-the-trot. The Romanian champs qualified for the 2024/25 UEL by defeating four opponents in the qualifying rounds. Since then, they've knocked off Rigas, PAOK Saloniki, and FC Copenhagen. Speaking at his Wednesday pre-match presser, Ilzer declared himself satisfied with the new double six pairing of Diadia Samassekou and Anton Stach in midfield.

The heavily-capped German youth international leads die Gießböcke in scoring with eight league goals this season. Lemperle has also pocketed four league assists and scored once in the Pokal.  The heavily-capped German youth international signed his current working papers in the summer of 2023 before being loaned out to SpVgg Greuther Fürth last season. He excelled for the Middle Franconian Kleeblätter during the 2023/24 campaign, scoring six league goals and adding six assists. His current estimated market worth stands at a career high €3 million.  Germany's Kicker Magazine linked struggling TSG 1899 Hoffenheim with a January swoop for Lemperle last week. Various other sources have also thrown VfB Stuttgart into the mix; a rumor now confirmed by the cathedral city's reliable ""Geißblog"" fan-site. The Kölner site does take care to note that Lemperle might yet extend his deal in the Domstadt.  Lemperle brings with him the experience of 26 total top flight appearances. He netted two Bundesliga goals whilst working with the Köln first team during the 2021/22 campaign, including what proved to be the winning tally in a 2-1 victory over Bochum on match-day three. The 22-year-old may opt to remain with the Effzeh as - just two points off top spot - promotion back to the top flight remains a possibility for his club.  ",

I read about it, but I don't think about it.” Asked when a decision will be made, Bischof smiled and said, “We'll see.” Hoffenheim managing director for sport Andreas Schicker, meanwhile, is optimistic that a new deal will be found for Bischof. ""I think he's doing very well. His parents and management are also doing a great job,"" Schicker said. “We are in constant dialogue. I'm still optimistic that we'll reach an agreement.”",

Despite the high goals, many of the games were close run affairs and with them came a lot of talking points. These are your talking points and recap from matchday 13 in the Bundesliga.  Bayern Munich overcame FC Heidenheim 4-2 to extend their lead at the top of the table to six points. Though it seems like another standard Bayern victory, all is not how it sounds.  Bayern rested Jamal Musiala from their midweek duel with Bayer Leverkusen in the cup and it clearly showed that there was a creative spark missing from the first half.  After Dayot Upamecano gave Bayern the lead but then the Frenchman gifted the visitors their equaliser in the second half.  Enter Jamal Musiala. The 21-year-old made an immediate impact giving Bayern the lead. Leon Goretzka would then make it 3-1, before former Bayern player Niklas Dorsch provided a brief scare. Musiala would then make it 4-2. This result showed that no matter how strong the opponent is, Bayern struggle without Musiala. This is obviously not sustainable as shown earlier on this season when Bayern struggled against Eintracht Frankfurt, Aston Villa and Barcelona. The Friday night game between VfB Stuttgart and Union Berlin turned out to be a cracker and would set the tone for the rest of the matchday.  Union looked comfortable with two goals either side of half time to take a 0-2 lead after 50 minutes. However, a Nick Woltemade brace and a first Bundesliga goal from Atakan Karazor ensured a stunning comeback from the Swabians.  Union looked stunned following the equaliser and never really got going again. Having only conceded 11 goals prior to the game, the collapse was all the more surprising.  The winner for Stuttgart highlighted Union’s complete meltdown as goalkeeper Frederik Rønnow passed the ball to Karazor allowing him to finish with ease.  It’s a welcome win for Stuttgart and shows they still have that fighting spirit which has served them so well over the past 18 months. The win leaves them in 8th and just one point from 5th.  The Ralph Hasenhüttl renaissance is well and truly underway at VfL Wolfsburg. Their thrilling 4-3 victory over Mainz 05 sends them all the way into 5th and well within a shout for Europe next term.  With both sides on a five game unbeaten run going into this one, there was no wonder that forwards dominated the day.  Mainz went ahead early with a great move to set Paul Nebel away who finished into the far corner.  However, Wolfsburg found themselves level just six minutes later, Mohammed Amoura firing home after the keeper’s original stop. The goal was made by the brilliance of Tiago Tomás whose solo run near the touchline created the goal scoring chance in the first place.  Jonathan Burkardt then restored the visitor’s lead five minutes before the break and in doing so became the club’s joint all-time goalscorer in the Bundesliga.  Shortly after the break Amoura turned provided for Tomás whose deflected effort found its way into the net.  Back came Mainz once again with Nebel, which was his first top flight brace of his career and his third goal of the campaign.  Jonas Wind looked to at least salvage a point for Wolfsburg with seven minutes to go, but deep into stoppage time Wind went one better and headed home a freekick to ensure Wolfsburg took all three points.  Wolves unbeaten in six games now and inflict Mainz’s first away defeat since March.  RB Leipzig got back to winning ways with a comfortable 0-2 away victory at Holstein Kiel. Though the hosts had more of the ball and shots, they never really threatened Péter Gulácsi in the Saxon’s goal. The win keeps Leipzig in 4th.  Borussia Dortmund have now failed to win an away game from their opening five away fixtures having draw 1-1 in Mönchengladbach. In fact, BVB have taken just one point from a possible 15 from away fixtures so far. The only positive was that Jamie Gittens found the net again and continues to impress.  Eintracht Frankfurt were held to a 2-2 draw at home to a stubborn FC Augsburg side. A quiet day for Frankfurt’s forward despite the team dominating the ball for most of the game. Perhaps the draw is a little reminder that though Frankfurt are a fun watch, they’re the youngest team in the league and lacked experience when it comes to these types of games.  Elsewhere, there were wins for Werder Bremen at still winless Bochum (0-1), Bayer Leverkusen beat St. Pauli (2-1) and SC Freiburg played out a 1-1 draw with TSG Hoffenheim.  GGFN | Jamie Allen  @2023 - All Rights Reserved.

Standing in their way was TSG Hoffenheim who have been out-of-sorts lately despite Christian Ilzer replacing the sacked Pellegrino Matarazzo. Setting up in an alternative 3-4-2-1 formation, the Breisgauers took the lead through substitute Vincenzo Grifo before Tom Bischof ensured a 1-1 stalemate. Both teams adopted a rather leisurely approach to the game with neither side offering much in the final third. Adam Hložek's pass sought Andrej Kramarić in the 10th-minute but Noah Atubolu was alive to the danger. Freiburg's best chance of the half fell to Gregoritsch who was played onside by Prass, but the Hoffenheim full-back managed to deny his compatriot in time. Although Bruun-Larsen and Gendrey had opportunities, Atubolu was equal to both in what would remain a scoreless first-half. Kramarić's low drive after the break crept past the left upright of Atubolu's goal. At the opposite end, Patrick Osterhage teed up Lucas Höler in the penalty area but the striker's outcome was similarly inaccurate. It wasn't long before Julian Schuster turned to his bench and called upon the services of Vincenzo Grifo as Osterhage vacated one of the double-ten roles behind Höler. The Sinheim side seemed to be getting on top until the Freiburg substitute acted as the catalyst for change.  As is so often the case, the Italian made an instant impact. With a delightful set-piece from the right flank, Grifo placed the ball on a silver platter for Mathias Ginter to divert past Baumann with an extended right boot. TSG restored parity 5 minutes later as substitute Max Moerstedt broke the ball for Tom Bischof to place his shot inside the right post from 17 yards. Denis Geiger stung the palms of Atubolu late on, as did Dinkçi when Baumann tipped his shot over. A share of the spoils seemed somewhat fair as the final whistle sounded. ",

Hoffenheim fell to a heavy 3-0 defeat in their Europa League clash with Braga, before they were beaten 2-0 in last Sunday’s league meeting with Mainz. Unfortunately for Ilzer, his team experienced another unsuccessful road trip in midweek, as they slumped to a 3-0 loss in their DFB-Pokal tie against Wolfsburg. After suffering a last-16 exit in the cup, Hoffenheim will now turn their focus back to league action, with die Kraichgauer languishing in 14th place after winning three, drawing three and losing six of their 12 league games. Hoffenheim will be hoping to claim their fourth league win in Sunday’s home fixture, but that may be easier said than done due to their poor record in recent meetings with Freiburg. Their most recent head-to-head win took place in December 2021 when they recorded a narrow 2-1 away victory. Meanwhile, they have not beaten Freiburg in a competitive home game since September 2018. The hosts are unable to call upon Christopher Lenz, Ozan Kabak, Umut Tohumcu, Florian Grillitsch, Grischa Prömel, Marius Bülter and Ihlas Bebou. Freiburg are experiencing an underwhelming run of form, having won one, drawn two and lost two of their last five competitive matches. The sole victory in that period took place in their most recent league outing, with a Lucas Höler brace helping them claim a 3-1 home victory over Borussia Mönchengladbach. Unfortunately for Freiburg, they were unable to collect another win in their midweek DFB-Pokal clash with Arminia Bielefeld. Michael Gregoritsch’s 63rd-minute effort proved to be fruitless in a 3-1 defeat against the second-tier side. The loss condemned them to a last-16 exit and extended their winless away run to four competitive matches (D1, L3). Julian Schuster’s side will now turn their focus back to league action, with Freiburg sitting in seventh place ahead of Saturday’s fixtures. The Breisgau-Brasilianer have won six, drawn two and lost four of their 12 matches in the Bundesliga this season. Their recent record against Hoffenheim suggests they have every chance of claiming their seventh league win on Sunday. Freiburg have won five of their previous six competitive meetings, including a Bundesliga double last season. The Breisgau-Brasilianer claimed a 2-1 away victory in August 2023, before they recorded a 3-2 home win in January. Daniel-Kofi Kyereh remains unavailable for selection, while Junior Adamu will serve the second game of a three-match suspension.",

Matters have not gone as hoped for the Austrian trainer. After his team scored four goals in a spectacular comeback victory against Leipzig in his debut match, Hoffenheim have failed to score a single goal in three subsequent losses.  “I'm not sure if I've ever lost three games in a row,” the 47-year-old remarked yesterday, ""It's been a big disappointment. The recent setbacks don't make things any easier, but we must stay focused on the path we've chosen."" ”Often it feels like you're stagnating, but in reality you're laying the foundation for the next step forward,"" Ilzer continued. ""We have to be aware that we will be rewarded at some point and that things will start to come together.” Ilzer spoke on form dips involving three specific players, first assuring members of the assembled press that keeper and captain Oliver Baumann had dealt with the mistake that led to the Sinsherimers getting defeated in Ilzer's second match in charge ""professionally"". When it came to the tanking of star players Andrej Kramaric and Tom Bischof, the TSG trainer addressed each player in turn.  “I see him as a carefree lad who is in very good form, even when things aren't going well for the team,"" Ilzer said of Bischof, ""He's good for us because he plays freely, without a lot of thought and without getting rattled."" ""We are still trying to find the best position for him to play his style of football,"" Ilzer said when discussing Kramaric, ""We're fine tuning how he uses space and working on his self-confidence."" The Kraichgauer travel to Breisgau this coming Sunday to take on regional rivals SC Freiburg. Few are according Ilzer's team much of a chance given their current form and the fact that Ilzer appears confused about how to bring out the best in his team. Should the TSG drop their fourth straight match, Ilzer will surely find himself on the hot seat not long after his arrival.  ",

The Malian international hasn't featured in the Kraichgauer XI since the opening Bundesliga match-day of the 2022/23 campaign.  Injuries to Florian Grillitsch and, Ilzer revealed at his Friday presser, German central midfielder Umut Tohumcu played a role in Samassekou receiving his chance in Wednesday's cup loss. Ilzer nevertheless revealed that the 28-year-old may well play a role in his future plans for the team. Hoffenheim had openly been attempting to offload Samassekou this summer after two consecutive loan-outs. No takers could be found for the 39-times-capped international, who did have a decent year representing his country. ""We wanted to have a second very stable player in the double six position who is good at winning back the ball,” Ilzer noted at his Friday presser, ”We definitely have to develop additional attacking opportunities from midfield duels. I think Diadie is an absolute starting point there, given the way he plays, which has justified his inclusion.” “He played well and definitely has potential to play in this area in the future,” Ilzer continued, ”Of course one could tell that he hadn't played for a long time. His strength waned in the second half, but he did very well and made a case for more appearances.” ",

The 19-year-old’s contract in Sinsheim expires in the summer and there has yet to be any indication that he will extend. This has resulted in the bigger Bundesliga teams beginning to swarm. Bayern, Borussia Dortmund, Eintracht Frankfurt, RB Leipzig and VfB Stuttgart have all been linked to Bischof. However, all the teams not named Bayern are away, and the Rekordmeister is well ahead of them when it comes to courting the midfielder.  Bayern is said to be offering Bischof a place on the squad as Leon Goretzka’s replacement. It is well known that Goretzka is surplus to requirements at Bayern and they are looking to get him off the payroll so they can fund Jamal Musiala’s contract renewal. Bischof offers an alternative that will require significantly less money than Goretzka meaning Bayern can make Musiala one of their most-paid players. However, Bischof would still need to compete with the likes of Joshua Kimmich, João Palhinha and Aleksandar Pavlovic for the starting midfield positions at the Allianz Arena.  GGFN | Jack Meenan @2023 - All Rights Reserved.

Despite being big fans of the 19-year-old, Dortmund are already well-stacked in midfield and it will be difficult to offer Bischof a path into the starting 11. Emre Can, Pascal Groß, Felix Nmecha and Marcel Sabitzer are all likely to be at Dortmund next season, so will block any path for Bischof into the 11, while academy product Kjell Wätjen is slowly being integrated into the squad.  With several options in midfield, this is also the reason why Dortmund are unlikely to try and sign Jobe Bellingham, the brother of Jude, as there are also no spaces in the squad with Julian Brandt also added to the mix.  GGFN | Jack Meenan @2023 - All Rights Reserved.

Hoffenheim, in contrast, have struggled so far this season and sacked their manager Pellegrino Matarazzo just three weeks ago. Since then, victory over RB Leipzig has liftened the mood around the club slightly but a poor result against Mainz on the weekend leaves them two points off the bottom three heading into the next game week. This year, both sides have struggled at times in the competition with Hoffenheim narrowly making it through the first round thanks to a penalty shootout win over Würzburger Kickers. Similarly, Wolfsburg only managed one goal in a narrow win over TuS Koblenz in their first game of the competition. Despite this, an impressive win for die Wölfe in the second round against Borussia Dortmund in extra-time might give them more hope than Hoffenheim ahead of this game.  Ahead of the tie, Wolfsburg coach Ralph Hasenhüttl said: “One should have the dream (of winning the cup) in the back of the head. It is always comforting to know that one's team is performing well in the league and is still in the cup.” Before the game, Hoffenheim coach Christian Ilzer said: “Wolfsburg has a lot of pace in attack. The team has found itself and is on a run. More important, however, is that we show a better quality than against Mainz on the weeekend.” Sebastiaan Bornauw, Rogerio and Aster Vranckx are all injured for Wednesday's game. Keeper Niklas Klinger will also miss the tie for Hasenhüttl's side. Ozan Kabak, Christopher Lenz and Florian Grillitsch are all out for Hoffenheim.

Greenwood converted from 12 yards with just a minute of normal time remaining, moving Marseille up to second in the table and ahead of Monaco on goal difference. The spot-kick was awarded for a handball from full-back Christian Mawissa as Marseille ended a three-game winless run against Monaco in the league. Valentin Rongier's poor pass in the first half had earlier allowed Aleksandr Golovin to counter-attack and open the scoring with just his second Ligue 1 goal of the campaign. Luis Henrique subsequently levelled before the hour, capitalising on some fine work from Neal Maupay, before Greenwood snatched victory for Roberto De Zerbi's side. At the other end of the table, bottom side Montpellier salvaged a 2-2 draw with fourth-placed Lille thanks to Arnaud Nordin's last-gasp leveller in an ill-tempered clash. Jonathan David had earlier scored a penalty in either half for the visitors, with Issiaga Sylla on target for Montpellier on the stroke of half-time to level after the Lille forward's first spot-kick. Montpellier head coach Jean-Louis Gasset was sent off late on before Tanguy Coulibaly and Mitchel Bakker were both dismissed in a chaotic ending. Coulibaly prompted the altercation by kicking the ball against Lille head coach Bruno Genesio, with Bakker and the Montpellier man taking the punishment for the clash that subsequently followed. Far less drama ensued in Lyon's routine 4-1 victory over Nice as Alexandre Lacazette's hat-trick helped his side move into fifth place. Sofiane Diop managed an equaliser for sixth-placed Nice after Lacazette's opener, only for the Lyon striker to put the visitors to the sword along with a goal from midfielder Jordan Veretout. Sunday marked the seventh time Lacazette has scored three or more goals in a Ligue 1 game, more than any other Lyon player in the competition's history. He also scored his 149th, 150th and 151st Ligue 1 goals. In the 21st century, only Kylian Mbappe (191) and Wissam Ben Yedder (161) have scored more in the top-flight.

A 2-1 win over Brentford at Stamford Bridge on Sunday saw the Blues cut the gap at the top, after Liverpool could only draw with Fulham on Saturday. Goals from Marc Cucurella, who was sent off after full-time, and Nicolas Jackson got the job done, but they were made to hold on as Bryan Mbeumo grabbed one back for Brentford near the end. Maresca has been adamant that his side are not yet ready for a title battle, and despite a fifth straight league win, he still believes there are issues for his players to iron out before they can call themselves challengers, with Brentford’s late goal being a prime example. ""It's not about how many games we win, it's about being realistic,"" Maresca told BBC Sport. ""There are things we have to do better. If you see the goal we conceded it was a throw-in to us, 90 minutes. ""The team that are ready to compete for [the title] use the ball in the right way.""

He added: ""In the first half, we were in control of the game. We could have scored more goals. ""The second half except the last 10 minutes where we struggled, which is normal, we deserved to win the game.” Cucurella was given a second yellow card after the final whistle for dissent and Maresca wants to see more maturity from his side going forward.

""I didn't see the second yellow card. The referee said the second yellow card was for bad attitude. There are things we can do better,"" he said. ""I said we have many things we can do better and this [Cucurella's red card] is one of them.""  Brentford boss Thomas Frank, meanwhile, was happy with what he saw from his team, who have picked up just one point on the road all season. The Dane told BBC Sport: ""We played a very good game here. We were unlucky not to get a draw. Some big chances we missed in the end. ""We managed for the 90 minutes to go toe to toe with Chelsea, especially in the second half. A draw would have been fair. ""Chelsea are a very good team, well coached, very good players. ""They're playing with confidence and credit to them for pushing us back in the first half. They are right up there in the title race. They're very good. ""If you look at the performance today against a top team who will go right to the end of the season and try to win the title, the way they celebrated it was clear they respected us and we could easily have got something."" © Copyright 2024 FotMob",Chelsea's 2-1 win over Brentford took them two points off the top but Enzo Maresca does not see his team as Premier League title contenders.

It’s a conundrum we looked at in detail earlier in the week – in an article you can read here.   Enzo Maresca’s side return to Stamford Bridge having won their last six matches in all competitions and unbeaten in their last nine using the same criteria. Not since their Carabao Cup defeat at Newcastle in October have the Blues been second best when the final whistle blows. As for opponents Brentford, this season they are a team that Jekyll and Hyde would be most proud of. The Bees have collected an impressive 22 league points from the 24 available at home but have picked up just a single point from the 21 offered on their travels.   This encounter could well be won by whose strike partnership performs best on the day. The visitors will have to be wary of the 19 league goals that Cole Palmer and Nicolas Jackson have scored between them this season.  But by comparison, the combined 18 league goals that Yoane Wissa and Bryan Mbuemo have bagged should not be overlooked either and although there were fears that Brentford would decline when Ivan Toney cashed in his chips to move to Saudi Arabia, his two former teammates have more than picked up the slack.   After a busy week both home and abroad, Chelsea manager Maresca will ring the changes. Not only because of Pedro Neto’s one-game suspension for five bookings but also due to fitness doubts surrounding the midfield pair of Enzo Fernández and Roméo Lavia.  Brentford will monitor the fitness of Vitaly Janelt before they make the short trip across the capital but he is likely to appear. The same cannot be said for teammate Mathias Jensen who suffered a hamstring injury at the start of the month and is not expected to be fit for this one.  Although Chelsea have had to cross continents with their trip to Kazakhstan this week, the additional time in the air should not hamper their bid to beat Brentford on Sunday – especially when you consider just how poor the Bees have been away from home this season.

          Football Journalist
       Sunday 15 December 2024 16:00, UK Our football betting expert Jones Knows is back to provide more Premier League insight as he hunts down the value in the markets. When it looks like a draw, walks like a draw, quacks like a draw, then it's probably a draw. And it becomes an interesting betting angle when that outcome is priced up as the outsider of the three at 11/4 with Sky Bet. When it comes to draws these two teams are superb at them. Crystal Palace have drawn a Premier League-high seven games this season and Brighton have drawn six - the joint second-most games. Six of the last 10 meetings have also ended 1-1. Keep the draw on your side. The fallen-giant derby. Both teams are on their lowest points total after 15 Premier League games. This sharp decline of Manchester City is becoming a maddening thing to unpack with Pep Guardiola's insistence that City are playing well while acting uncharacteristically hapless in trying to fix it is certainly adding to the circus of it all.

             The defensive numbers behind City's results of seven defeats in 10 are extraordinary - a sackable offence for most managers. Since October 5, City are working at a per-game average of conceding 2.79 big chances on their goal - only Ipswich and Southampton have a worse return. Teams are charging past them in transition at will and their per-game average of being dribbled past figure of 10.36 is extraordinary - only West Ham have a higher average. Guardiola's side have conceded two or more goals in nine of their last 10 matches, meaning the 7/4 with Sky Bet on Manchester United following suit and scoring at least twice is the value call in a winnable game for Ruben Amorim if he gets his tactics right to expose City's laughable make-up out of possession. Why aren't Chelsea serious title contenders? It's a question I've been pondering as they've shortened dramatically into 6/1 with Sky Bet for the Premier League crown. The inconsistency factor is high on that reasoning. Teams that win titles win matches when not playing well. I'm not sure this young Chelsea side are there yet - there are going to be bumps in the road, especially with such an unreliable goalkeeper in Robert Sanchez between the sticks. That bump could be on the horizon here. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Credit to them they've managed to fend off a funny result for most of the season but one might be due, which may help dampen the expectations in the long run. Brentford haven't lost to Chelsea in five matches, winning the last three at Stamford Bridge. Yes, Thomas Frank's football isn't quite as savage on the road but they will hold no fear and Chelsea look a risky prospect at 1/3 with Sky Bet for the win, especially at an odd kick-off time. Brentford double chance at 9/4 it is then. Tyler Dibling is going to win Southampton a game on his own soon - he's that good. And in truth, Russell Martin probably needs him to as the Saints carry little attacking threat, bar the exciting vibes that Dibling brings. This might be the night where Dibling delivers a big one. Defences don't come as generous as Tottenham's without Micky van de Ven - he is so instrumental to Ange Postecoglou's style of football and his weak hamstrings will probably be the big Aussie's downfall as Spurs look flat, timid and a shell of their best at the moment. Dibling to score in a home win at 9/1 with Sky Bet stands out. Andoni Iraola's unique and hard-to-stop football is surely going to land him a top job soon enough - if a vacancy were to come up at Tottenham for example, Iraola should be their number one priority. In the last 44 games, Iraola has Bournemouth as the sixth-best team in the Premier League - that is an outrageous achievement for a club who were only promoted two seasons ago. Just look at how subsequent promoted teams have fared, it's no easy task. They are a better football team in every department than West Ham, who once again looked quite stodgy and lacking identity in their important win over Wolves. The home win is skinny enough at 7/10 with Sky Bet but adding under 4.5 goals into the mix gets us to a 5/4 shot that makes sense considering the Cherries have seen under that line in 10 of their last 12 home matches.

Chelsea were looking to become the first team to start a Women's Super League campaign with 10 straight victories, with Bompastor already the first coach to win their first nine matches at the helm in the competition.  However, they were surprisingly held by Leicester, requiring a Wieke Kaptein equaliser after Missy Goodwin fired the Foxes ahead in the first half. Chelsea were utterly dominant throughout, accumulating 28 shots and 1.9 expected goals (xG) to Leicester's two, worth 0.39 xG. The Foxes had lost each of their last four WSL matches without scoring, but Saturday's result ensured they avoided becoming just the sixth team to lose five in a row to nil in the competition, after Yeovil Town (12), Bristol City (seven), Birmingham City (six), Doncaster (five) and Reading (five).  Bompastor credited Chelsea's hosts for their resilience but said she was disappointed with her team's start to the game, as just six of their shots came prior to the interval.  ""For sure we're frustrated about the performance today,"" Bompastor said. 'When we talk about ambitions, we need to turn words into actions.  ""I need my players to be ready from the beginning of the game. If you analyse this game, the first half was not intense enough from us.  ""We did not show our intentions, and I think we got punished for that. The second half was better – we created more chances and opportunities – but we only scored one.   ""We were not efficient enough to win this game. I'm frustrated because we have talent in the team, but we didn't show that in the first half.  ""The players need to realise this is a competitive league and if you don't show up from the start, you don't get good results."" Chelsea's slip-up opens the door for Manchester City, who will now enter the winter break three points adrift of the summit if they overcome Everton on Sunday. ""It's even more frustrating for me because when the other team plays a really good game, you have to give credit to them,"" Bompastor continued. ""They were all together and mentally tough, but I think we have more talent than that.  ""We had to be able to beat this team today and if you have ambitions to finish at the top of the table, you cannot drop points like we did in this game today.""

The Foxes had lost each of their last four WSL matches without scoring, but Saturday's result ensured they avoided becoming just the sixth team to lose five in a row to nil in the competition, after Yeovil Town (12), Bristol City (seven), Birmingham City (six), Doncaster (five) and Reading (five).  Bompastor credited Chelsea's hosts for their resilience but said she was disappointed with her team's start to the game, as just six of their shots came prior to the interval.  ""For sure we're frustrated about the performance today,"" Bompastor said. 'When we talk about ambitions, we need to turn words into actions.  ""I need my players to be ready from the beginning of the game. If you analyse this game, the first half was not intense enough from us.  ""We did not show our intentions, and I think we got punished for that. The second half was better – we created more chances and opportunities – but we only scored one.   ""We were not efficient enough to win this game. I'm frustrated because we have talent in the team, but we didn't show that in the first half.  ""The players need to realise this is a competitive league and if you don't show up from the start, you don't get good results."" Chelsea's slip-up opens the door for Manchester City, who will now enter the winter break three points adrift of the summit if they overcome Everton on Sunday. ""It's even more frustrating for me because when the other team plays a really good game, you have to give credit to them,"" Bompastor continued. ""They were all together and mentally tough, but I think we have more talent than that.  ""We had to be able to beat this team today and if you have ambitions to finish at the top of the table, you cannot drop points like we did in this game today."" © Copyright 2024 FotMob","After 14 straight victories across all competitions, Sonia Bompastor's 100% record in charge of Chelsea came to an end on Saturday."

According to Sky Sport via Calciomercato, the Roma loanee left the hospital on Friday afternoon after recovering from cardiac arrest.  Bove underwent surgery on December 10 for the implantation of the removable subcutaneous defibrillator. The subcutaneous defibrillator implanted is removable, and Bove will have the option to keep it or have it removed based on the results of future medical evaluations. The 22-year-old collapsed on the pitch in a Serie A meeting between Fiorentina and Inter on December 1. Heart-stopping moments at Stadio Artemio Franchi sent shockwaves through the football community in Italy and abroad.  Quickly after being admitted to the hospital, the Fiorentina youngster spent a couple of days in the intensive care unit of Careggi before being transferred to the UTC. Thankfully, Bove has fully recovered and is ready to return to Viola Park to greet his teammates and manager, Raffaele Palladino. However, Bove’s career in Serie A is over. He will no longer be allowed to compete in professional sports in Italy, mirroring the case of Christian Eriksen, who had to leave Inter in 2021.  The Fiorentina starlet must wait to receive comprehensive documentation from his tests, which will determine whether his myocarditis is genetic or inflammatory in origin, helping to assess the potential risks he might face moving forward. As for Fiorentina, they’ll likely dive back into the market this winter to strengthen Palladino’s midfield options amid La Viola’s incredible season in Serie A.

Now that Edoardo Bove is out of the hospital, Fiorentina can breathe a sigh of relief. Replacing him on the pitch, though, will doubtless give Raffaele Palladino some headaches. Bove was the key to Fiorentina’s early-season success. His energy and intelligence meant he could basically play 2 positions, shifting out wide when the number 10 wanted space between the lines and tucking in when the leftback wanted to overlap, while also providing an extra body in central midfield out of possession. Fortunately, Palladino’s got a lot of guys who can operate on the left wing. Unfortunately, none of them replicate Bove’s impact. It may take some chopping and changing for the mister to figure out how best to compose his XI, especially with Albert Guðmundsson finally healthy again. Let’s run down the obvious options in alphabetical order. In a lot of ways, el Vikingo is the most similar of the group to Bove. He’s always busy, presses really well, and is comfortable in central positions. He hasn’t shown a real facility for playing out wide yet but he also hasn’t been asked to, so he could probably adapt. It does seem a shame to take him out of the number 10 position, where he’s been outstanding since Guðmundsson’s injury (2 goals, 5 assists) and shown a great understanding with Moise Kean. Palladino’s tried him out there for short spells over the past few games, so this may be his top pick. Guðmundsson’s mostly played as a second striker for most of his career but does have some experience out wide. Using him on the left could create more space for him as opponents clog the middle, making it easier for him to cut inside and shoot. However, he was brought in to play as the 10 and has looked best when given license to roam a bit. His defensive work is also suspect, especially since that left winger needs to offer Robin Gosens some protection. He’s often the object of derision among fans, but the Ivorian is popular with all his coaches because he’s smart, runs non-stop, and follows instructions. He’s always been great at tracking back and doesn’t mind making big off-ball runs to open space for his teammates. His lack of end product is frustrating but Bove wasn’t always super decisive in the final third either. The real issue is that Kouamé is Kean’s only backup, at least until January, and using both of them at the same time risks blowing up Palladino’s player rotation. Palladino’s used Parisi on the left wing several times this year to mixed results. Against opponents looking to attack, it’s worked out: Parisi’s dribbling and pace make him tough to stop on the break. Against more deeper blocks, though, he lacks the technical ability to break down his man or the physical attributes to offer a threat otherwise. Like Kouamé, using him here would also blow up the rotation, especially now that Cristiano Biraghi’s talked his way out of town. That goes double if Mario Giuffredi follows through on his bluster to force Parisi out too, although we’ll see if that actually happens. The new mister has coaxed a new level out of the ravishing winger, helping him find consistency and a more reliable end product. It also helps that Ricky’s fully healthy and often looks like the fastest guy on the pitch. He’s not going to replicate Bove’s defensive contribution or passing but his ball-carrying might replace the latter, and, if nothing else, his ability to win free kicks and chip in with goals and assists (4 and 2 respectively this year, or 1 every 156 minutes) means he would juice the attack. The concern is that his newfound impact is best deployed against smaller squads, but maybe it’s time to trust him one more time. Gambling Problem? Call 1-800-GAMBLER (1-800-426-2537). Hope is here.

Tommaso Martinelli—6.5: Made a good stop on Maximilian Enstrup after Kayode’s flubbed knockdown but didn’t have much else to do as every other save he made was quite tame. More than anything, it was cool to see him make his first appearance in the Franchi, which must’ve been quite an experience for him. Fabiano Parisi—7.5: Under the spotlight after his agent threatened to pull him from the squad and responded brilliantly. In fairness, this game set up perfectly for him, as he had to do minimal defending and could bomb down the flank unopposed as LASK sat very narrow. Still, he was really good, chasing down loose balls and making things happen in the final third. Luca Ranieri—6.5: Played a lovely ball in for Ikoné that #ChaosJonny missed. Struggled a bit against big Maximilian Entrup but did enough. Pretty quiet day for him, all things considered. Lucas Martínez Quarta—6.5: Much like Ranieri, didn’t have much to do. Did pick up a pointless booking in stoppage time, which was frustrating. Michael Kayode—6.5: Motored up and down impressively but continues to look shaky, exemplified by a really bad attempt to chest down a high ball for Martinelli to scoop up. Kayode got it all wrong and was lucky not to be punished. The potential is still there, but he set the bar impossibly high for himself last year and now everyone thinks he’s bad. It’ll be fine. Rolando Mandragora—7: Invisible as ever but in the right way. Didn’t have to do too much running and focused on knocking the ball around, doing a good job of regulating the tempo. Finished a nice team move and hit a lovely ball over the top for Kouamé/Kean on that early goal that got ruled out. Well done, Roly. Amir Richardson—7.5: Silky in possession, clever on the ball, and quick to snuff out moves before they got going. He’s got every tool and for the first time this year, he used them all correctly. This is the kind of player he can become night in and night out, and watching him reach that ceiling is going to be a joy. Riccardo Sottil—9: He’s too fast, too clever on the ball, and too skillful for the likes of LASK and he made sure everyone knew it. Still a bit arrogant at times but he’s finding his footing. This is who Fiorentina fans have been hoping he’d be for years. Christian Kouamé—7: Ran non-stop both in and out of possession. Got an assist and helped create half a dozen great chances with his pressing. Still managed to squeeze in a couple of mystifyingly bad touches but that’s just who he is and no amount of grumbling will change it. Jonathan Ikoné—7.5: Scored the simplest goal of his life but, knowing his track record, that’s still an accomplishment. Was a bit quieter than I’d expected but still produced a few slithery runs capped off by weird decisions. Moise Kean—7: So unlucky not to score but that’s fine. Was pretty quiet after his initial goal was ruled off until the very end of the first half, when he went on the rampage and was denied only by Lukas Jungwirth at close range and the frame of the goal. He’s still him. Matías Moreno—6.5: Without any pressure, he could play a little looser and it suited him. Composed with his positioning and on the ball, making a couple of decent interventions in the box. Still settling in. Lucas Beltrán—7: Won the penalty and bustled around as per. I was hoping to get a sense of how he’ll look on the left as Guðmundsson takes over as the 10 but the circumstances prevented us from getting a good sense. In a lot of ways, though, he’s the closest thing to a Bove replacement on the roster, so this may be the way forward. Albert Guðmundsson—7.5: Obviously a cut above everyone else, threading passes through the middle and taking neat touches in and around the box. Still ramping up but approaching full power. Andrea Colpani—6.5: Showed some neat touches and nearly scored off a lovely feed from Kouamé that eventually resulted in the own goal. Also deserves plaudits for his tracking back. Jonas Harder—6.5: Fiorentina’s first ever number 64 was tidy enough on the ball and didn’t let the moment overwhelm him as he made his debut. He’s not ready for a regular role with the senior side yet but he’s definitely one to watch. 1. Fiorentina advances. The Viola had the early game, but once the dust settled after the later fixtures, the standings confirm that, mathematically speaking, the team is advancing out of the group/league/whatever weird thing we’re calling this first stage with 1 game left. Considering how this Conference League campaign began—scraping past Puskás Akademia in the playoff then unconvincingly holding off TNS and St Gallen—it’s a pretty fine achievement. As you can see, Fiorentina’s climbed to 3rd after goosing its goal difference. The top 8 sides advance straight to the Round of 16 while places 9 through 24 have an additional two-legged playoff to determine the other side of the bracket. The objective is to finish in that top 8 to skip another couple of draining fixtures, which, given the injuries throughout the squad, has to be front and center of Raffaele Palladino’s mind. Funnily enough, Fiorentina can secure that bye with a win at Vitória next week, which would be quite nice. A draw will be enough if 3 of Cercle Brugge, Jagiellonia, Rapid Wien, APOEL, and Djurgården fail to win. If Fiorentina draws and 3 or more of those 5 win, the Viola will still probably advance on goal difference. A loss, however, muddies things quite badly. Once again, if 4 of those aforementioned 5 teams win or 3 of them win by massive margins, the Viola will drop to the playoff spots. If that all seems complicated, well, it is. And Palladino and his boys could simplify it significantly by taking all 3 points in Guimarães. 2. The team doesn’t look too distracted. There was significant concern that, between Edoardo Bove’s situation and Cristiano Biraghi/Mario Giuffredi’s temper tantrum, the players’ minds would be understandably elsewhere. We saw what that looked like against Empoli in the Coppa Italia last week and I had braced myself for a repeat in this one, especially when LASK came out wearing what looked like Udinese kits from 2010. Those Zebrettini teams were awful to play against and I figured it’d be more of the same. There were multiple points the team could’ve lost focus, starting with Kean’s early goal being chalked off. They did switch off after each of the first 3 goals, too: LASK had a great chance moments after conceding, but a bit of luck saw the Viola escape unscathed. After the break, it was all business. The traditional Italian approach is to call off the dogs once the scoreline is 3-0 in order to rest everyone and preserve a bit of dignity for the opponents, but Fiorentina never slowed down. To me, that indicates a level of unity that’s really important for any good team. It’s easy for everyone to get along when everything’s going well, when the wins are piling up, and that’s where we are now. With the Biraghi situation, though, there was the opportunity for things to collapse and they didn’t. The guys stuck together. Rather than being a pariah, Parisi was right at the heart of everything, despite his agent trying to remove him from the squad. The players all celebrated with the staff, too, so it seems that everyone’s still fully behind Palladino. Fiorentina’s in a weird position right now. Despite rattling off wins at a historic clip, they’ve faced real adversity in these Bove and Biraghi situations. That almost makes winning easier: everyone rallies around and focuses on the team, creating an us-vs-them mentality that can carry everything through. However, there will be a point this season when the club’s dropped a few games and everything begins falling apart. While we never know how anyone will react to that, the emotional strength currently on display is reassuring. 3. This wasn’t a serious game. Serious teams don’t lose games 7-0, and right now, LASK isn’t a serious team. The Schwarz-Weißen were missing 12 senior players, have already sacked a coach this year, and look like they could sink into the relegation places if they aren’t careful. Maybe they bounce back after a result like this but the combination of Fiorentina’s superiority, their own negative circumstances, and the random bounces of the ball meant that this one was over before the half hour mark. Serious analysis isn’t possible in those circumstances.  Gambling Problem? Call 1-800-GAMBLER (1-800-426-2537). Hope is here. GamblingHelpLineMA.org or call (800) 327-5050 for 24/7 support (MA).

While McMike’s under the weather and possibly suffering Nyquil hallucinations, your remaining favorite Fiorentina podcast idiots—that’sProducer Mike and Tito if you weren’t clear—run through the latest goings on. At the top of our minds, of course, is Edoardo Bove, because his medical episode was terrifying, and we first and foremost hope that he’s okay and that he does whatever’s best for his health going forward. Losing him for the foreseeable future, though, means that Daniele Pradè and Roberto Goretti have a lot more work to do in the January transfer window, although there may be some in-house solutions to replace Edo. Returning to actual stuff on the pitch, we also discussed the Cagliari game and touched on the Coppa Italia before taking a dive into the future of the goalkeeping position in Florence. Along the way, we also discussed whether it’s better to get punched in the mouth or grabbed by the nipple and who’s going to stake out McMike’s house to confirm that he’s alive, as is a Viola Nation tradition. Thanks to the Sport Social Podcast Network for hosting us and to Windchime Weather for the music. Hit us up on the website, Twitter, or Blue Sky with any questions. As always, we hope you enjoy listening to this one as much as we enjoyed making it. Forza Viola! Gambling Problem? Call 1-800-GAMBLER (1-800-426-2537). Hope is here.

Raffaele Palladino trotted out a distinctly second-choice XI. Tommaso Martinelli made just his second senior start (and first at the Franchi). Moise Kean did get the nod up front to provide some teeth to an attack. Markus Schopp trotted out his expected lineup, largely because he’s got 12 absences in the senior team. It’s worth noting, too, that the Stadio Artemio Franchi was pretty empty, allowing the 700 visiting fans to make themselves heard a bit more than you’d expect. Fiorentina came out like gangbusters. Moise Kean scored with 2 minutes after Christian Kouamé (maybe intentionally) dummied a bouncing ball past goalkeeper, but VAR ruled it out for the slightest of handballs. Luca Ranieri played Jonathan Ikoné in beautifully moments later but #ChaosJonny scooped it wide while he was all alone. The breakthrough finally came via Riccardo Sottil, who roofed a sliding volley after Fabiano Parisi tracked down a Michael Kayode cross and played it back in. Kayode nearly gave away the equalizer by missing an attempt to chest it down for Martinelli but the youngster managed to push Maximilian Entrup’s shot onto the bar and Parisi eventually cleared. The Viola then retook the initiative, looking miles the better side as they created several opportunities, with Parisi, Sottil, and Kouamé all looking active. The goal, though, came from a woeful backpass from LASK’s Maxim Talovyerov. Kouamé ran it down, rounded Jungwirth, and then played it back to the penalty spot, where Ikoné arrived all alone to thunder it into the empty net. LASK again came close right after conceding, with Talovyerov just missing a free kick header, but the good guys quickly retook the initiative, knocking the ball around LASK’s half and applying constant pressure as they searched out a third. That pressure resulted in yet another goal. This time, Sottil hung a free kick up to the back post and Amir Richardson headed it home. Sometimes, it’s just as simple as letting the very tall dude score headers. The Viola nearly switched off again but again LASK lacked the quality to take advantage, and the scales immediately tipped back towards the hosts. The only drama left was whether referee Balász Berke would start pulling out his cards—Florian Flecker in particular deserved one—and whether Kean would score; he had 2 great chances in stoppage time but had the first saved after nutmegging his defender in the box and watched the second strike the woodwork. It was, in short, all Fiorentina in the first half, and that was just fine with us. Fiorentina emerged from the break perhaps a bit too relaxed, allowing the game to open up more than it needed to for the opening minutes. The boys settled down, though, and started turning the screws again. They added the 4th via Sottil again via a nice passing move between him and Kouamé, but the way the ball set up for him after his first attempt was blocked summed up the evening: everything broke right for the Viola. Now thoroughly demoralized, LASK just gave up the ghost. The Austrians were completely unable to get out of their own half and Fiorentina constantly won the ball high up and looked for clever little combinations to add another. It eventually worked when substitues Lucas Beltrán and Albert Guðmundsson combined to put Rolando Mandragora clean through on goal and he duly bundled it home. Fiorentina wasn’t done, though, and kept hunting the ball down in the visitors’ half. Guðmundsson’s passing quality was on full display and he looked likely to add another but it ended up being Filip Stojković, although it wasn’t his fault at all. Albert played in Kouamé, who one-upped him with a lovely ball into the middle for Andrea Colpani. El Flaco’s shot was saved but rocketed off Stojković and into the net to make it 6-0. pic.twitter.com/MP9ZvXYZJS Was that it? Reader, it wasn’t. An utterly deflated LASK faffed around in their own box again and it ended with a poor touch by Talovyerov that Flecker tried to clear, but Beltrán pounced and got his boot in ahead. Berke pointed to the spot and Guðmundsson waited for Jungwirth to dive then rolled it the other way. 7-0. Good lord. pic.twitter.com/GDTH11gSnV Kouamé nearly won another penalty in stoppage time but was offside, thank goodness. The only real interest at that point was watching local kid, Primavera star, and Italy U19 international Jonas Harder make his senior debut in midfield. By the end, it was pretty clear that the LASK players would’ve rather been anywhere on earth than inside the Franchi. Yikes. Goals: Sottil 10’ (ass. Parisi) 58’, Ikoné 22’ (ass. Kouamé), Richardson 39’ (ass. Sottil), Mandragora 69’ (nice ass. Guðmundsson), Stojković OG 82’, Guðmundsson PK 85’ Cards: Martínez Quarta 90’; Jovičić 45’+1 Fiorentina earns its biggest European win ever and its highest scoring to boot, outdoing last year’s 6-0 against Čukarički. It’s also Sottil’s first double at senior level. Richardson also got his first Viola goal, while Ikoné buried his 4th in the Conference League, putting him one off the lead (jointly held by Krzysztof Piątek of all people). It was a good chance for a lot of guys to have some fun. It’s time to get serious again, though, as the Viola travel across the mountains for a narrative-packed Derby dell’Appennino against Vincenzo Italiano’s Bologna on Sunday. A win in that game will set a new all-time Serie A winning streak for Fiorentina with 9 in a row, which would be pretty dang cool. In the Conference League, this win means Fiorentina has taken a big step towards finishing in the top 8 in the table, which in turn means a direct path into the Round of 16 rather than an extra two-legged playoff. The Viola sit 2nd in the standings behind Chelsea, even on 12 points with Lugano and Legia Warsaw, although Jagiellonia, Rapid Wien, and Vitória could leapfrog them with games kicking off later today. Regardless, though, Fiorentina’s advanced out of this wacky group stage, and will secure a bye with a result against none other than Vitória a week from today. Gambling Problem?

Atalanta top the standings on 34 points, two ahead of Antonio Conte's Napoli, with Inter and Fiorentina both one point further back on 31. Reeling from Tuesday's 1-0 loss at Bayer Leverkusen, Simone Inzaghi's side remain without injured defensive pillars Francesco Acerbi and Benjamin Pavard ahead of Monday's visit to his former club. Inter's 573-minute run without conceding a goal in the Champions League ended when Nordi Mukiele scored for Leverkusen in the 90th minute on Tuesday. That capped a miserable trip to Germany for Inter, who failed to record a single shot on target in a Champions League game for the first time since February 2022 (versus Liverpool), and for the first time on record (since 2003-04) in the competition's first round.  Lazio, meanwhile, have racked up consecutive victories over Napoli in league and cup, with the Biancocelesti facing Ajax in the Europa League on Thursday before returning to Serie A action. Inter could be six points off the top by the time they take to the field for that headline fixture, with Atalanta targeting a piece of history at Cagliari on Saturday. Gian Piero Gasperini's Dea side have won nine straight Serie A games to equal their club record, having also won nine in a row between February and July 2020. Another victory would make this their best-ever winning run in the competition. This is only the second time that Atalanta have topped the table at the end of a Serie A matchday since the competition returned to 20 teams in 2004-05, having only managed to do so after the fifth matchday in 2022-23. Until now, Atalanta had never led the top-flight table as many as 15 matches into a campaign. They are big favourites to maintain their winning streak against 15th-placed Cagliari, with Gasperini having no new injury concerns. Giorgio Scalvini is out, having sustained a shoulder injury ahead of Tuesday's Champions League 3-2 loss to Real Madrid, while Gianluca Scamacca and Juan Cuadrado are longer-term absentees. While both Inter and Atalanta were beaten in Europe this week, Juventus claimed a huge result by beating Manchester City 2-0, courtesy of goals from Dusan Vlahovic and Weston McKennie. The Bianconeri's triumph came despite them only having 31% of possession – only once previously on record (since 2003-04) have they won a Champions League game while having a lower share of possession (27% versus Chelsea in September 2021).  In Serie A, however, it has been a case of possession without purpose for Juventus, who remain unbeaten but have drawn nine of their 15 matches, including each of their last three, to sit sixth. ""Nothing bothers me. I perfectly accept all honest judgements, but I won't enter this story,"" Juve coach Thiago Motta said, when asked about criticism of their domestic form. ""I am only focused on my work: improving the team and helping my players. The rest doesn’t count much."" With last-placed Venezia travelling to Turin on Saturday, Motta should be confident of maintaining the feel-good factor built in midweek.  Juventus have dominated this fixture historically, winning 10 of their last 12 Serie A matches against the newly promoted side. Surprise package Fiorentina, meanwhile, are riding high on an eight-match winning streak in Serie A, and they could make history when they travel to Bologna – led by former Viola boss Vincenzo Italiano – on Sunday.

The left-back hasn’t been a regular since Antonio Conte switched from 3-4-2-1 to 4-3-3 earlier in the season. Mathias Olivera has started basically every game in recent months. According to Gianluca Di Marzio, the defender spoke with the boss, who won’t obstruct his departure if he receives a good offer. He’s attracting interest from Real Betis and Saudi Arabia. He was already linked to such a league a few times near the end of his Giallorossi stay. Instead, he hasn’t received enticing proposals from other Italian sides for now. He has made 12 appearances so far, assisting once. On the other hand, he last started in Serie A back in mid-September. He’s been an unused sub in four of the last six rounds. He makes €1.8M annually. Napoli have quickly identified Cristiano Biraghi as a potential replacement for Spinazzola. The Fiorentina captain is unhappy with his game time too. His agent Mario Giuffredi just announced he’d flee in January. The Partenopei would be quick to pounce if they found a solution for their outcast. Conte already coached the 32-year-old at Inter in 2019/2020. He split time with Ashley Young and posted 3 goals and 7 assists in 37 appearances that year. Other than in the recent Lazio game, Olivera has been solid and has grown a lot. His competitor should arguably get some more run when they need to score, but he’s never played regularly as a fullback. In the end, it’d be a lateral and minor transition.

He lashed out against Raffaele Palladino after the coach announced the former wouldn’t be called up for the match versus LASK Linz due to a technical choice. He spoke with FirenzeViola. “I’ll reply to him at the end of the window. They will both depart in January. I’m sure they’ll have some offers. We’ll see in due time if the coach has the guts. There’s something cooking already. I don’t know whether they’ll transfer on loan or permanently, but their stay is over.” Biraghi and Parisi have been hurt by Fiorentina acquiring Robin Gosens last summer, as he’s been the clear top option at left-back. The captain had started routinely in the Conference League. His relationship with Palladino had been cordial, but he didn’t take well the news that he wouldn’t have made the XI on Thursday, Tuttomercatoweb informed. The boss dished in his pre-game presser. “I think that Cristiano wasn’t used to not playing with consistency. He’s always been the captain and is a key player for this team, and he has done important things when called upon. He has found less room in recent matches. It’s a technical choice that can’t be questioned. I wouldn’t add anything more to that.” According to Alfredo Pedullà, Como like the youngster, while his teammate could wind up joining a big team.

According to Sky Sport via Calciomercato, Marco Baroni’s men are contemplating a winter bid for the unsettled Ajax midfielder. Tahirovic, who joined Roma from Vasalunds IF in 2021, left the Stadio Olimpico last summer to team up with the Dutch powerhouse. However, the 21-year-old has fallen out of favor with manager Francisco Farioli and is now keen on leaving Amsterdam. Lazio could be his next stop. Despite his past ties with Roma, the surprising Serie A title contenders are considering luring the Bosnia & Herzegovina international back to Italy. However, Lazio are not the only Italian club interested in capturing the services of the ex-Giallorossi playmaker.  After Edoardo Bove’s collapse against Inter earlier this month, Fiorentina are in the market for a new midfielder and could challenge Lazio for Tahirovic’s signature. In addition to Italian giants, Tahirovic has admirers in other European leagues. PAOK and Celtic are willing to fight Lazio and Fiorentina. Meanwhile, Ajax chiefs must be rubbing their hands. The Eredivisie outfit paid Roma €7.5 million to sign Tahirovic a year and a half ago and will aim to recoup their investment.  With a bidding war on the horizon, they’re well-positioned to maximize their gains. As for Lazio, they could use today’s UEFA Europa League encounter against Ajax as a pretense to gather information about the Bosnian starlet. Your email address will not be published.

Fiorentina manager Raffaele Palladino spoke ahead of the Conference League tie with LASK and the biggest news was that he hasn’t even selected club captain Cristiano Biraghi for the bench due to a “technical decision” rather than any sort of injury. The mister was as even-keeled as ever in his presser, explaining that Biraghi’s used to playing more but insisting that the club’s (read: Palladino’s) decision must be respected.   L’allenatore @acffiorentina #Palladino: “Biraghi fuori per una scelta tecnica. Lui era abituato a giocare con continuità. Quando è sceso con noi in campo ha dato tutto, quindi lo ringrazio ma è una mi scelta tecnica che va rispettata”. Epilogo di un rapporto mai nato pic.twitter.com/vVd96WNRHj Biraghi has been 2nd-choice at best since the Viola snapped up Robin Gosens on deadline day this summer and the German has been quite good despite having to adjust to playing in a back 4. The captain has stayed quiet in public but tensions have clearly been simmering inside the jeweled fortress of the Rocco B. Commisso Viola Park. Biraghi had accepted the demotion to backup, but it seems that a rise in Fabiano Parisi’s profile at his expense was a step too far; the youngster has received considerably more playing time over the past month, leaving Biraghi glued to the bench. Per TMW, things came to a head in training yesterday when Palladino separated the starters and reserves. Biraghi received the black shirt (which feels very Juanes, no?), symbolizing that he wasn’t starting. Palladino hadn’t previously informed him and the player likely felt humiliated in front of his peers, telling the coach not to bother calling him up at all if it was just for the bench. Biraghi’s been a steady presence in the city and showcased some tremendous toughness and leadership, both in and out of the spotlight. For example, he could’ve milked the injury received when a West Ham fan hit him with a vape pen, possibly even getting the game called off and a Viola victory, but he instead kept his feet and kept going despite the blood pouring down his face, even though he was clearly shaken up and probably concussed. His response to the floods that hit Tuscany last year was at least as impressive, as he threw on his waterproof boots and got to work cleaning up the neighborhood like everyone else without trying to publicize his efforts. Despite wearing the DA13 armband since 2021 and producing some of the most statistically bizarre seasons ever, fans have never really liked him, and if he’s been a bit prickly in return, well, he’s fully justified. However, this is the second time he’s fallen out with a coach (although Cesare Prandelli flatly denied the worst rumors) and, even worse, he’s acted in a way deeply unbecoming of the club captain. If Fiorentina takes 3 points in Bologna on Sunday, it will set a new record for consecutive wins in Serie A with 9. Breaking up that kind of momentum with gripes about playing time is the opposite of leadership, especially when the team’s likely still reeling from Edoardo Bove’s episode last week. Even so, the bridges could probably be rebuilt if not for Biraghi’s agent Mario Giuffredi immediately responding to Palladino’s comments. Giuffredi told FirenzeViola that Biraghi will leave the team in January, whether on loan or permanently. “Let’s see how big [Palladino’s] balls are,” is a pretty strong statement and likely marks the point of no return. There aren’t any concrete offers for Biraghi as far as anyone knows, but there will doubtless be suitors. Adding yet another wrinkle, though, is that Giuffredi also represents Fabiano Parisi and bombastically declared the 24-year-old would also be leaving. That feels like career malpractice, as Parisi’s obviously in line for a bigger role with Biraghi on the way out, but Giuffredi clearly feels that the bombast and vengeance outweigh a golden opportunity for another client, which feels quite on brand. Giuffredi also represents a third left-footed defender on the team, but Luca Ranieri seems quite happy in Florence and there’s been no word about him wanting out, so it’s likely that Parisi was considering a move away in the interest of more playing time anyways. Still, it means that Daniele Pradè and Roberto Goretti have a busy January coming up as they scramble to find a leftback as well as a winger (to replace Bove) and a striker (to back up Moise Kean). Fiorentina, just one normal day. That’s all I ask. (And sorry, m.atthew, this is your meme but I couldn’t find your original anywhere.) Gambling Problem? Call 1-800-GAMBLER (1-800-426-2537).

Speaking in an interview with Firenze Viola, Cristiano Biraghi’s agent Mario Giuffredi affirmed that the player is set to leave Fiorentina during the January transfer window. The defender was excluded from The Viola’s Conference League squad against LASK as coach Rafaelle Palladino cited technical reasons. However, the agent was quick to confirm the actual reason behind such a decision as he claimed: “I will respond to Palladino at the end of the transfer window, I don’t feel like talking about it too much today but Biraghi will be leaving.” Apart from mentioning the 32-year-old’s name, Giuffredi also indicated a departure for Fabiano Parisi as rumours have skyrocketed about where these two players will play their future.  December is expected to be the final month in Biraghi’s Fiorentina career where he is currently featuring in his seventh season since joining the ranks in 2017.    Trambak Bhattacherjee | GIFN   @2024 - All Rights Reserved.

However, he hasn’t had any room with the first team during the regular season, and he has struggled to find his footing with the Futuro squad in Serie C too. According to Calciomercato, the Rossoneri are mulling the future of the starlet, whose contract runs out in 2026. It’s not so certain it’ll be with them, as he would like to be given a real shot. Atalanta and Fiorentina have shown interest and would be ready to pounce if he became available. Milan will have to make the call about Liberali next summer given the expiration date of his deal. The extension talks haven’t gone far due to his challenging season. He was named among the 60 most promising youngsters in the world by The Guardian. The 17-year-old hasn’t received consistent minutes in the Daniele Bonera-led team. He last appeared on October 30th and hasn’t been called up in the past month. He’s been sent back to the Primavera side, where he’s starring domestically and in the Youth League. The youngster has scored once in each competition. He also hit the net in his first match in the Coppa Italia Serie C but didn’t produce in seven appearances in the third division. Paulo Fonseca selected him twice without fielding him. His contract is more of a factor than his displays, as he’s super young and has all the time in the world to improve. Still, it’d be quite ludicrous if he didn’t resume playing regularly with the Futuro team. Your email address will not be published.

If all goes well, he’ll be discharged from the hospital by the end of the week. According to international guidelines, the measure is mandatory for all patients who suffered a cardiac arrest due to atrial fibrillation, La Repubblica reported. The patient has been informed of the risks and consequences and has given his green light. On the other hand, he’ll have the faculty of taking it away down the road. Bove won’t be allowed to play in Italy with an ICD. It’ll be possible in other countries, for instance, England, the Netherlands, and Belgium. Christian Eriksen had to leave Inter after a similar event during Euro 2020 but eventually continued his career elsewhere. The instrument intervenes to correct the heart rhythm when necessary. Cardiologist Antonio Spataro weighed in. “In Italy, the law mandates an agonistic certification for those who practice any sport. There are some conditions that can negate it. What happened to Bove and the ICD are among those. After six months, he’ll be able to participate in non-contact activities that require moderate physical effort. Other countries leave the choice up to the person. There’s an ethical debate on the matter. If somebody earns a lot with what he’s doing, he generally keeps going. Instead, we have different bylaws and are advanced in that regard.” Bove will leave the hospital and head home between Thursday and Saturday. He joined Fiorentina on loan from Roma last summer. Impossible this incident is any way related to a vaccine injury. Just bad luck like the thousands of other young athletes with sudden heart issues. Your email address will not be published.

It’s the first Friday of the month, and that means it’s time to hop in the time machine and go a very short distance backwards again. With 9 goals in 5 matches (10 if you count David Goldar turning Sottil’s cross into his own net against Pafos, which for the purposes of this exercise I’m not), it’s not quite at October’s bonanza level, but there are still some worthy aspirants for you to choose from. Here are your 5 candidates, presented in chronological order. In just the 5th minute, Fiorentina took control. For a moment, it looked like Tomáš Suslov was in on goal, but Luca Ranieri came across and put an earth-shaking tackle on him. The ball eventually found Lucas Beltrán, who drove a good 40 yards before slipping in Kean, making a clever run through the defense. Moise produced the tidiest of finishes. This one isn’t perhaps the greatest individual effort but as a team goal and an encapsulation of how Raffaele Palladino wants his boys to attack, it’s perfect. It’s rare to see a finish from a corner on this sort of list, but Moise Kean is a rare bird. Despite Diego Coppola embracing him like a long-lost brother, the striker somehow stuck a leg out and casually redirected Yacine Adli’s corner into the spot where the owl sleeps. It looked elegantly simple but the combination of physical and technical abilities to pull this off is truly remarkable. “Moise picked up the lone defender, patted him gently on the top of the head, and then spiked him into the molten core of the earth before rifling a shot past Lorenzo Montipò, who might as well have turned away and walked off the pitch as soon as that ball got to Kean. There was no suspense. It was pure certainty.” The small-minded trolls will claim that Emil Audero should’ve saved this one because it was pretty close to him. But those small minds simply can’t comprehend that 1) the ball was hit through a crowd, leaving Audero minimal time to react, and 2) that ball was hit as sweetly as any you’ll ever see. Goalkeepers don’t save that kind of connection. My goodness. Another deceptive one for Moise, with the added bonus of some Riccardo Sottil action. Ricky blazed past his defender, picked up his head, picked out his striker, and fizzed in a low ball. Kean turned it home; if that was all that happened, it would’ve been a deeply standard goal. But the way he hit it—a lefty finish that wafted into the top corner—makes this one a little more special. Feel free to vote for one of the other 4 goals. Kean against Torino (outmuscling Guillermo Maripán to a clearance and smashing it home), Ikoné against Apoel (a 1-2 with Christian Kouamé to get in behind and a composed finish), Kouamé against Pafos (a stumbling, bumbling, chaotic close-range finish), or Lucas Martínez Quarta against Pafos (Cristiano Biraghi spots the weak spot in the marking at a corner and tells LMQ to exploit it), but you’ll have to say which one in the comments.

Fiorentina CEO Alessandro Ferrari provided an update to SportMediaset (via OneFootball). “He’s in good shape. He’s recovering, and we’re happy with that. We need to be patient and respectful while he gets past this moment. He’s fine and already changed the area at the hospital. It means that things are going better. He’s in the hands of capable professionals that will figure out what happened. He moved from the ICU to a department called UTIC, which is a step below.” Fiorentina elected not to postpone the Coppa Italia tilt versus Empoli. They lost on PKs. Coach Raffaele Palladino dished on the team’s psyche afterward (via Ansa). “It’s inevitable to be affected after going through a situation like the Bove one. I can’t reprimand the lads. Something affected us today, especially in the first half, when we erred in things we usually do correctly.” According to La Gazzetta dello Sport, Bove collapsed due to severe arrhythmia, but the reason is proving to be hard to find. The MRIs found a little scar on his heart. The doctors are investigating his past. He suffered from myocarditis due to a COVID-19 infection in 2020, but he overcame it easily. The tests in the following years didn’t find anything unusual. The cause could be genetic. Per La Repubblica, the player no longer requires treatment but just to be monitored. He has signed off on inserting an implantable cardioverter defibrillator. It wouldn’t allow him to play in Italy, but he’d be able to continue his career abroad. Not a vaccine injury. Couldn’t be.

After erasing a first-leg deficit and beating Rapid Wien in the UEFA Europa Conference qualifiers, La Viola finished top of their group before beating Maccabi Haifa, Viktoria Plzeň and Club Brugge en route to their second consecutive final in UEFA’s fledgling third tier competition. Having lost to Atalanta in the Coppa Italia semifinals and Napoli in the Supercoppa Italiana semifinal in the previous months, this was their chance to win their first piece of silverware in 23 years. Once again, the footballing gods subjected Fiorentina to another cruel twist of fate. When it seemed the title would be decided on penalties, Ayoub El Kaabi scored in the 116th minute to snatch a 1-0 victory for Olympiacos, who became the first Greek team ever to win a European trophy. There was no more room for doubt: it was time for a rebuild. Veteran midfielders like Giacomo Bonaventura and Gaetano Castrovilli left on free transfers, defensive talisman Nikola Milenković and top scorer Nicolás González joined Nottingham Forest and Juventus for substantial fees, and coach Vincenzo Italiano left his post after three years at the helm. Enter: Raffaele Palladino.   Palladino only made his managerial debut on September 13, 2022, guiding Monza to a maiden Serie A victory against Juve and leading them to 11th and 12th-place finishes in their first two seasons in Serie A before making the move from Lombardy to Tuscany. And yet, he’s quickly implanted his tactical DNA and steered Fiorentina to a stellar start. After 13 games played, La Viola find themselves on track to qualify for the Champions League for the first time in 16 years. “Italiano’s Viola won the possession battle in every game, often to their own detriment as opponents dropped into a deep block and picked them off on the break,” said Tito Kohout of the English-language Fiorentina website Viola Nation. “Palladino’s team, on the other hand, is happy to soak up pressure and play on the break, giving the attackers more space to work with. There’s now a willingness to let the players find their own solutions within a tactical framework rather than insisting on mechanical repetitions and hoping something works. That was Italiano’s approach and it dragged Fiorentina back from the brink, but wasn’t fun to watch and became very predictable.” After spending the past years tightening their pursestrings and budgeting for the construction of the €110 million Viola Park which contains 10 practice fields, two stadia, a swimming pool, and state-of-the-art training and medical facilities, Fiorentina were finally able to spend more than they received in transfer fees and acquire 11 new players in the summer of 2024. Many of these signings were, for lack of a better word, rejects. Danilo Cataldi, Edoardo Bove and Yacine Adli were surplus to requirements at Lazio, Roma, and Milan, but they’ve all found a new lease on life in Fiorentina’s midfield. One man’s trash is another man’s treasure, and that’s certainly been the case with Moise Kean. Having failed to score in 20 appearances last season for Juventus, Kean has racked up 12 goals and one assist in 15 appearances since heading to Fiorentina. His nine league goals are bettered only by Mateo Retegui (12), while he leads Serie A in Expected Goals (9.1) and Expected Goals on Target (9.8).   Fiorentina are conceding the third-fewest goals per match (0.8) and have the third-most clean sheets (6) in Serie A thanks in large part to the stellar performances of another ‘reject’: David De Gea between the sticks. Despite boasting a decade of experience as Manchester United’s starting goalkeeper, he was forced to spend an entire year as a free agent before finally finding a new club in August. It hasn’t taken long for him to hit top form at the Stadio Artemio Franchi, registering the highest save percentage (82.5%) and the third-most goals prevented (3.0) in Italy.   “Sporting Director Daniele Pradè and Technical Director Roberto Goretti did an amazing job in the window,” said Kouhout. “Because so many players arrived late in the window, there wasn’t much continuity in preseason and Palladino had to build the plane in midair. It was pretty bumpy at the start but it started falling into place against Atalanta. A lot of what Fiorentina is doing on the pitch looks sustainable rather than just being outlier results, so Palladino deserves a ton of credit for the work he’s done integrating the new signings and then changing the entire system just a month into the season.” After opening the season with five straight draws and a loss at Atalanta, Fiorentina edged Lazio 2-1 before drawing 0-0 at Empoli. Since then, they’ve won 10 of their last 11 matches, the sole exception being a 2-1 defeat at APOEL in the UEFA Europa Conference League on November 7. Palladino has struck the right balance with a 4-2-3-1 formation based on aggressive, man-to-man marking, a high backline, and quick, vertical passing – no team is completing more accurate long balls per match than Fiorentina (27.8). They sit fourth in Serie A, four points behind Napoli, level on 28 points with Inter, Lazio and Atalanta, two above Juventus and six above Milan, with a game in hand on Napoli, Lazio and Juve. We’re only a third of the way into the season, but Fiorentina are on track to finish in the top six for the first time in nine years.   They were looking to secure a ninth straight league win in Sunday’s home match vs. Inter, but the game was suspended after Bove collapsed onto the pitch in the 17th minute. He was hauled away in an ambulance and spent nearly 13 hours in a medically induced coma before being extubated on Monday. Edoardo is awake, alert, and responding to questions, and the first cardiological and neurological tests have ruled out acute damage to the central nervous and cardiorespiratory systems. Fiorentina fans are accustomed to heartbreak – both on and off the pitch. Club captain Davide Astori and chief executive Joe Barone tragically succumbed to cardiac arrest in March 2018 and March 2024, but as for Bove, he looks set to make a miraculous recovery from his cardiac arrest. And when he does return to the pitch, he’ll be given a hero’s welcome at a club whose supporters have been given more and more reasons to smile.     (Cover image from IMAGO)   You can follow all the action from Serie A on FotMob – with in-depth stat coverage including xG, shot maps, and player ratings. Download the free app here.

La Repubblica today, as relayed by TVPlay, report that Bove will undergo local anesthesia surgery to insert an internal defibrillator. The player himself has already given his consent to this operation. However, in fact, this choice brings with it the fact that Edoardo Bove will no longer play in Serie A. That is because players with a defibrillator are not allowed to play in the Italian top flight, as witnessed in the case of Christian Eriksen, who left Inter right after his incident and joined Brentford. This means that like Eriksen, Bove will also have to depart the Serie A and seek other pastures. The feeling in Italy is that the defibrillator can ‘break’ at any point, causing potential harm to a player’s life and they do not want to take that risk.           Kaustubh Pandey I GIFN @2024 - All Rights Reserved.

Fiorentina has made deep runs in the Coppa Italia the past couple years, reaching the final and the semifinal. On Wednesday, 4 December 2024, at 8:00 PM GMT/3:00 PM EST, it opens this season’s campaign in the competition with a local derby against Empoli at the Stadio Artemio Franchi. When these two met in the league a couple months ago, it ended in a deathly dull scoreless draw as the Viola moved to a back 4 for the first time. Expect a solid turnout in the chilly Tuscan evening, but given that it’s a weeknight, the Franchi will probably be well under even its current limited capacity. 1. How the team’s feeling. Edoardo Bove is okay. That’s the most important thing. The earnest well wishes and palpable relief among players, staff, and fans has been all-enveloping but for that former group especially, it’s ridiculous to expect them to bounce back and play as if nothing had happened. We all saw the emotional impact watching a teammate collapse had on these guys; one look at the disconsolate faces was enough to let you know that these guys have been through something immense.

   Distasteful as it is to talk about a game now, it might be hard for the players to focus on the match plan after 72 hours of turmoil. It’s more than just seeing a coworker suffer something so sudden. It’s also a glimpse at their own mortality in a way that must be extraordinarily jarring. If they need some time to recover emotionally, that’s okay. They deserve it. On the other hand, Bove himself has already stated his desire to return to playing, and that could inspire them to go all out as a way to honor and support him. None of us know how they’ll react out there, but now more than ever, we need to support them. 2. Empoli’s defense. The noisy neighbors were one of Serie A’s biggest surprises in the opening weeks, rising as high as 5th when they met the Viola in September. Despite their reputation for developing exciting attacking talents, it was the defense that carried them to such rarefied air: through the first 6 match weeks, they conceded just 3 goals and kept 4 clean sheets, including against Juventus. As I wrote earlier, though, the underlying numbers indicated that they were more lucky than good, and I predicted that they might slow down soon. Sure enough, Roberto D’Aversa’s men have only taken 6 points from their last 8 matches, keeping just 1 clean sheet and allowing both Milanese clubs to put 3 past them. They’ve slid down to 10th—still higher than the stat geeks expect—but it seems that their month-long overperformance is grinding to a halt. They’ve average the least possession in the league and concede the most shots and the most fouls. In short, they’re constantly under pressure, and that’s just not a way to sustain success for a full season. Of course, long-term sustainability doesn’t matter much in a one-off game, especially when it’s a derby. Having already stifled Fiorentina’s attack once, Empoli will be confident of doing so again, and that’s a considerable part of the battle. The Azzurri will sit very deep, focus on maintaining their shape out of possession, and make the Viola beat them. No one wants to hear it, but this could be a cross-heavy game: Empoli will block off the middle but has the lowest aerial success rate in Serie A, so we could be in for an old-fashioned bombardment. 3. The returnees. Raffaele Palladino may have more options than usual. Albert Guðmundsson made the squad for the first time in 6 weeks against Inter Milan and, while he’s probably not fit enough to start, should get some minutes off the bench as he tries to find fitness. Amir Richardson has also recovered more quickly than expected from a calf injury he picked up on Morocco duty, although he might need another week before he’s ready. The real question, though, is in goal. David de Gea will get a well-earned break, but that doesn’t mean Palladino’s got an easy choice. Pietro Terracciano is the obvious choice, especially after his exemplary 2023-2024. The problem, though, is that Tommaso Martinelli is also ready to go. The 18-year-old has been tabbed as Fiorentina’s long-term solution between the sticks and this could be his year to prove it. If he gets the nod, it could symbolize a passing of the torch from the World’s Funnest Dad to the World’s Least-Impressed Teenager. Fiorentina is pretty heavily favored for all the obvious reasons: at home, higher in the table, better form, et cetera. However, the odds just don’t matter much here; see point number one above. Anything could happen in such an emotionally uncertain environment, especially when it’s the Derby dell’Arno. I’ll still back the Viola to win, not least because it sounds like the players really want to win it for Bove. That kind of emotional boost can overcome some sloppiness, which is likely to be the defining feature of this game. Empoli is going to be a stubborn out, sitting very deep and only sporadically venturing into the opposition half, so it’ll probably just take one goal, and bah gawd, that sounds like Moise Kean’s music.

Cesare Casadei's sending off in second-half stoppage time took the gloss off an otherwise impressive display, with the Blues' focus now turning to Aston Villa this weekend.  Chelsea lead the league phase of the competition and are on the brink of the last 16. Maresca praised the mentality his side showed to stay perfect in the competition. ""It was a very good challenge for all the aspects, they were high pressing, intense, but no matter what they do, it's important we are ready,"" he added. ""It's important to continue with that mentality.""

At the same time, the Catalan giants have themselves had a bit of a stumble in recent weeks.  Barcelona have won only one game out of their last four league games. They did recover from last weekend’s home defeat to Las Palmas by routing Mallorca 5-1 in midweek. But one thing is certain; there are some chinks in the armour of the Blaugrana.  Manuel Pellegrini‘s Real Betis had started off the season in a fine fashion but they have faded away over the last couple of months. They haven’t won a single league game since beating Atlético Madrid towards the end of October and the last three have yielded only a single point. That run has included a 4-2 loss to struggling Valencia.   Pellegrini’s Los Beticos will be hoping to expose Barcelona’s recent problems, as they look to lift themselves in the top half of the table. They could be helped by their good home record, having lost just once at the Benito Villamarín.  Goalscoring has been an issue for Pellegrini’s side in recent weeks, with Betis having underperformed on their Expected Goals metric by about six.   They’ve created an xG of 22.4 but have scored 16 times only. On top of that, they have missed the joint second-highest number of big chances this season – behind only Barcelona. The only difference in this context is that the Catalans create a lot of chances and them missing 40 big chances doesn’t matter as much to them.   Vitor Roque, who is on loan from Barcelona, will surely have something to say in this department on Saturday, having already revealed that he would like to score against his parent club.  Flick’s insistence on playing a risky yet effective high defensive line has worked out well for Barcelona so far – generally speaking. It helped them register wins over Real Madrid and Bayern Munich but at the same time, there are some concerning underlying numbers. They have conceded the ninth-highest xG in LaLiga and a lot of it is because of how high they operate.   Whether that approach is sustainable or not remains to be seen in the longer term but Pellegrini’s side will count on those weaknesses tomorrow.  Johnny Cardoso, Nobel Mendy, Héctor Bellerín, Marc Roca, William Carvalho and Isco are on the sidelines for Los Verdiblancos.  For Barcelona, Ansu Fati, Andreas Christensen, Marc Bernal, Marc-André ter Stegen, Ronald Araújo will remain out. Robert Lewandowski will come back into the side after being rested in mid-week.

Hansi Flick‘s side find themselves four points clear at the top of the table and have played a game more but the gap could have been much less comfortable, if Real Madrid hadn’t stumbled against Athletic Club on Wednesday. At the same time, the Catalan giants have themselves had a bit of a stumble in recent weeks.  Barcelona have won only one game out of their last four league games. They did recover from last weekend’s home defeat to Las Palmas by routing Mallorca 5-1 in midweek. But one thing is certain; there are some chinks in the armour of the Blaugrana.  Manuel Pellegrini‘s Real Betis had started off the season in a fine fashion but they have faded away over the last couple of months. They haven’t won a single league game since beating Atlético Madrid towards the end of October and the last three have yielded only a single point. That run has included a 4-2 loss to struggling Valencia.   Pellegrini’s Los Beticos will be hoping to expose Barcelona’s recent problems, as they look to lift themselves in the top half of the table. They could be helped by their good home record, having lost just once at the Benito Villamarín.  Goalscoring has been an issue for Pellegrini’s side in recent weeks, with Betis having underperformed on their Expected Goals metric by about six.   They’ve created an xG of 22.4 but have scored 16 times only. On top of that, they have missed the joint second-highest number of big chances this season – behind only Barcelona. The only difference in this context is that the Catalans create a lot of chances and them missing 40 big chances doesn’t matter as much to them.   Vitor Roque, who is on loan from Barcelona, will surely have something to say in this department on Saturday, having already revealed that he would like to score against his parent club.  Flick’s insistence on playing a risky yet effective high defensive line has worked out well for Barcelona so far – generally speaking. It helped them register wins over Real Madrid and Bayern Munich but at the same time, there are some concerning underlying numbers. They have conceded the ninth-highest xG in LaLiga and a lot of it is because of how high they operate.   Whether that approach is sustainable or not remains to be seen in the longer term but Pellegrini’s side will count on those weaknesses tomorrow.  Johnny Cardoso, Nobel Mendy, Héctor Bellerín, Marc Roca, William Carvalho and Isco are on the sidelines for Los Verdiblancos.  For Barcelona, Ansu Fati, Andreas Christensen, Marc Bernal, Marc-André ter Stegen, Ronald Araújo will remain out. Robert Lewandowski will come back into the side after being rested in mid-week.  Prediction Barcelona should pick up a win in this one, with the Catalan giants having not lost at the Villamarín since 2008.

As the competition’s top scorer, with 15 goals in 16 games, the Polish striker will be one of the key figures in the lineup Hansi Flick is set to field against Manuel Pellegrini’s Real Betis, who sit 11th in the LaLiga standings ahead of kick-off at the Estadio Benito Villamarín (Saturday December 7, 10:15 a.m. ET / 7:15 a.m. PT.). Few changes are anticipated from the team that secured a convincing 5-1 victory over Mallorca, with Raphinha and Lamine Yamal expected to play alongside Lewandowski in the attacking trio. ✈️ BARCELONA→SEVILLE!#BetisBarça pic.twitter.com/lDUfeutobF In midfield, Marc Casadó and Pedri remain undisputed starters. However, there is greater competition for the third midfield spot, with Dani Olmo, Gavi, Fermín, and Frenkie de Jong all vying for a place. Olmo, when fully fit, is regarded as the leading option. If Flick opts to rest him for Wednesday’s Champions League away game against German side Borussia Dortmund (11 December, 3:00 p.m. ET / 12:00 p.m. PT.), Gavi is likely to step in. The defensive line is also expected to remain largely unchanged, with Pau Cubarsí and Íñigo Martínez anchoring the central defense, Jules Koundé and Alejandro Balde occupying the full-back positions, and Iñaki Peña continuing as the goalkeeper instead of recent signing Wojciech Szczęsny. On the bench, Ferran Torres, who lost his starting role to Lewandowski, will be available alongside Eric García, who recently returned from injury against Mallorca. Other substitutes include Pablo Torre, Fermín, Wojciech Szczesny, Frenkie de Jong, Pau Víctor—both of whom impressed with goals and assists during their cameo appearances in Son Moix—and several reserve team players, including Astralaga, Fort, Martín, and Domínguez.

Raphinha scored twice in that match, taking his tally of LaLiga goal contributions for the season to 17, a joint-league high alongside Lewandowski. The former Leeds United attacker has been crucial to Barca's form under Flick, and the former Germany coach claimed Raphinha is a player he cannot afford to rotate. Flick told reporters: ""We need Rapha. When he is available, he will play. ""If he's ready for 90 minutes, then he'll play 90 minutes. So is Lewandowski, who will also play tomorrow.""  Barca, who top the LaLiga standings with 37 points, snapped a three-game winless run in the league with the victory over Mallorca.

They are always capable of pressing high up the pitch, that's their style and we have to be careful,"" Flick said. ""They know how to play and we have to be focused. Manuel [Pellegrini] is a very experienced coach, his teams always play very good football.

Across his LaLiga coaching tenure, Pellegrini has recorded a 47.9% win ratio. His best win percentage came at Real Madrid, where he won 81.6% of his matches (31 wins out of 38 games).

As much comes after the Spanish international was forced under the knife for a 2nd time, owing to unforeseen complications in his recovery from a fractured fibula. Recent weeks had seen Isco spotted back out on the grass, giving rise to hope of a return at some point in December. Few, however, predicted his comeback arriving as soon as it has.

The name of frontman Roque has of course returned to the forefront of the headlines in the buildup to the upcoming round of La Liga fixtures. This comes as the Brazilian’s current club – Real Betis, prepare to lock horns with his parent club – Barcelona. Roque joined the former on loan with an option to buy this past summer, after an altogether difficult six-month stint in Catalunya’s capital. So, what is his status for Saturday’s clash at the Estadio Benito Villamarín? Often, upon loan deals being made between two clubs from the same division, a ‘fear clause’ is inserted into the terms of the contract, to ensure that the player involved is not eligible to face his parent employers. Roque, however, is under no such restriction. As reiterated by Mundo Deportivo this week: ‘Tigrinho refused to accept the fear clause that the Barcelona board wanted to include in his contract.’ He will therefore be at the disposal of boss Manuel Pellegrini on Saturday evening.

Ten-man Killie shrugged off the early sending off of Robbie Deas and went in front just ten minutes later through Bruce Anderson’s penalty. They then put in a power of work to negate being a man down although the Jambos didn’t offer much either. They failed to force the issue and in truth it seemed inevitable the game would end 1-0, which it did. Kieran O’Hara made a save from James Penrice and Yan Dhanda struck the bar at the death but that was all Hearts could muster. Neil Critchley couldn’t believe what he was seeing at Rugby Park as his Hearts side lost to ten-man Kilmarnock. He feels his players played right into Killie’s hands by allowing them to be comfortable and accepting how the game was going to play out instead of doing something to change it. And the Englishman has accused his players of not having hunger or desire on the day. He said: “I’m more than disappointed. I was stunned by what I’ve just witnessed. I thought we started the game quite brightly, the first three minutes, then the sending off changes the course of the game.  “We got involved in the emotion of the game for the next ten minutes, with the crowd being involved, and we made poor decisions with the ball for that short period, and for the rest of the game with the ball. “We made poor decisions off the ball as well, and one of them cost us a penalty, which ultimately lost us the game.  “But after that, we’ve had ample enough time to get back into the game, and we didn’t produce nowhere near enough quality, intelligence, our decision-making was woeful. It’s like we forgot where the goal was.  “And I can assure you the message was: ‘We need to ask questions of the defence’. “They were going to put men behind the ball, defend low. And when you defend low, there’s not a lot of space behind, there’s not a lot of space. They give you the space in front, and we just played in front of them, we played into their hands, and we didn’t do anywhere near enough. It was as if we accepted what was happening on the pitch, and I was really shocked by what I saw. “I’ve just said the same thing to the players. What I say to you, I say to the players, there’ll never be a gap between what I say in the dressing room and here. I give them my honest feelings. They spoke in as a group as well when I left, and we need to make sure that we draw a line in the sand, and that level of performance can’t happen again. That’s why I’m shocked by it, because I’ve not seen that from this group. “We’ve lost games, but even when we’ve lost, we’ve shown desire, hunger, we’ve gone right to the end, we’ve played with aggression and insensitivity, and we’ve shown none of that today, none of it. If you look at our level of performance after playing in Europe, in some tough games, we’ve produced good performances.  “Now, we’ve not always won, but today that was not a good performance at all. It was a million miles away from that. I sincerely hope that that’s a one-off. If it isn’t, then we’ll have a problem. Only time will tell, and the next few performances will tell me a great deal.” Critchley also has mounting injury issues and it is not good news on Frankie Kent who joins fellow Hearts defender Stephen Kingsley on the sidelines potentially for the rest of the season. But it is better news on Beni Baningime despite the midfielder missing today’s game. Critchley added: “We’re hopeful that Beni will come back quicker. He had an injection early on in the week, just to settle a little bit of an issue in his knee down, but we’re hopeful that will clear that up.  “He’s done a little bit of running, and we’re hopeful that that will settle the issue and he can return sooner.”",

   Report as Kilmarnock recover from Robbie Deas being sent off inside the first 10 minutes for a high challenge on Kenneth Vargas; Hearts slump to another defeat after Bruce Anderson's spot-kick proved to be the winner for Killie Sunday 15 December 2024 17:57, UK Hearts remain bottom of the Scottish Premiership after losing 1-0 to 10-player Kilmarnock at Rugby Park. The hosts looked to be facing an uphill task after defender Robbie Deas was sent off inside the first 10 minutes for a high challenge on Kenneth Vargas. But Bruce Anderson's spot-kick gave Killie the lead and they could have added to it, with Hearts goalkeeper Craig Gordon making big saves to deny Marley Watkins and David Watson. Hearts hit the woodwork twice through Musa Drammeh and Yan Dhanda but they were disappointing against the 10 players. Kilmarnock manager Derek McInnes had made two changes from the draw with Dundee United last time out, introducing Bobby Wales and Watkins, while Craig Halkett and Drammeh came in for Hearts, replacing the injured Frankie Kent and the suspended Lawrence Shankland. Hearts were inches away from taking the lead after just one minute as Kilmarnock goalkeeper Robby McCrorie missed a corner, allowing Drammeh to volley against the inside of the post. The home side got away with that one but they had no such luck moments later as Deas went in heavy on Vargas' ankle.

             Referee Don Robertson initially issued a yellow card to the Killie defender before upgrading it to red after being sent to the screen by VAR Gavin Duncan. It had been a busy start to the match for the referee and he was involved again after a quarter of an hour as he awarded Kilmarnock a penalty after James Penrice caught Joe Wright late in the corner of the box. Anderson stepped up and coolly slotted the ball to the left of Gordon to give Killie the lead. Despite their numerical disadvantage it was Kilmarnock who should have doubled their lead in the 28th minute as Watkins was put clean through but Gordon came out and made a vital stop. Watkins came close again in the 40th minute as he latched on to Fraser Murray's cutback but Penrice made a vital block. Hearts had been poor since the red card and Alan Forrest saw a low effort easily saved by McCrorie as the first 45 minutes came to an end. Kilmarnock had the first chance of the second half in the 48th minute as Brad Lyons drove forward and released Watson but the Killie substitute saw his low effort well stopped by Gordon. Kilmarnock had another chance in the 54th minute when Watkins cut the ball back for Liam Donnelly whose deflected shot squirmed agonisingly wide. Hearts were still looking toothless and boss Neil Critchley made four changes before the hour mark, bringing on Liam Boyce, James Wilson, Jorge Grant and Dhanda. Wilson nearly made an instant impact as Cammy Devlin caught the Killie defence napping and cut the ball back but the young striker saw his shot blocked. Kieran O'Hara had replaced McCrorie in the home goal at half-time and he was eventually called into action in the 73rd minute, getting down low to nip a low Penrice shot away to safety. Substitute Dhanda thought he had salvaged a point for the visitors in stoppage time but his curling shot came back off the crossbar as Kilmarnock secured a deserved win.

The home side found themselves down to ten after just six minutes as Robbie Deas walked for an early challenge on Kenneth Vargas.  Referee Don Robertson initially booked the centre-back but was asked by the VAR to take a second look and upgraded to a red card. But Killie didn’t look like the team reduced in numbers and just ten minutes later they were in front. James Penrice stuck a high boot up as Joe Wright went for a header and a penalty was awarded, Bruce Anderson tucking it away. Hearts couldn’t find the solution as they tried to break the stubborn ten men down and Derek McInnes’ side were typically dogged and resolute. VAR had to get involved and aid the decision to send Deas off early in the game. On the basis of the replays, the correct outcome was correctly reached. Deas was straight-legged, over the ball and met Vargas’ ankle with the full force of his studs. It is actually quite surprising Robertson didn’t think it worthy of a red card straight off. It didn’t matter in the end though and credit is very much due to the Kilmarnock players who managed to get the win despite being down to 10 men for pretty much the entire match. If there was a side and manager in the Scottish Premiership you would back to do just that it would be Killie and Derek McInnes, so it wasn’t much of a surprise. But the Ayrshire men were actually pretty comfortable here and able to keep the men in maroon at arm’s length. Hearts’ problems this season are well known, struggling at both ends of the park. It was the poor attacking play that was evident today and they just never did anything to make you think they were going to find the breakthrough here. Missing Lawrence Shankland through suspension after his return to form with a double against last weekend, the likes of Musa Drammeh and Kenneth Vargas didn’t offer enough of a threat. There was no attacking potency or creativity and the Jambos are looking in real trouble as a result. Kieran O’Hara didn’t have a save of note to make until a decent one to deny James Penrice on the 74th minute. And while Yan Dhanda hit the bar late on it was too little, too late. It has been confirmed Hearts are looking to sign a striker in January and today served to display just how much that is required. It would seem they could do with more than just the one attacking reinforcement though, with a wide man or two potentially on the agenda. Recruitment in general is going to be so important for them and that has been exacerbated by Frankie Kent’s ‘significant’ injury which Neil Critchley admits will keep him out long term.",

They were both enforced with captain Lawrence Shankland suspended after racking up too many bookings and Frankie Kent having to go off early in that match with a serious looking injury. He had just returned from a game and a half out with a problem with his quad and Hearts manager Neil Critchley revealed post-match that was where the issue lay again. The fears were that it looked a lot worse this time round, adding to their injury woes with fellow Hearts defender Stephen Kingsley already out for possibly the rest of the season. Ahead of the Killie clash, Critchley has now offered an update on Kent’s situation. BBC Scotland reporter Brian McLaughlin has suggested Kent may not be seen again this season but Critchley stopped short of confirming that. He did reveal though that it is a ‘significant’ injury and the defender will be missing for quite some time. The Jambos boss said: “No, he’s got a similar injury to Stephen Kingsley but in his quad not his hamstring. So it’s a significant injury which is a big blow, obviously. “And he’s facing a lengthy period on the sidelines. I would say months, definitely. “He still needs to go and see a specialist to decide whether we’ll operate on him. “He’s been outstanding since I’ve been here, a big personality. He’s a good guy to have around the dressing room. “We’ll miss him but it’s an opportunity for someone else now.” The Tynecastle club are looking to do business in the January transfer window to add quality in certain areas to their unbalanced squad. It has been confirmed Hearts will be looking to sign a striker with the help of Jamestown Analytics after doing a deal with the data firm. They are also looking to add defensive cover and that is now exacerbated by the Kent injury. Asked about that, Critchley added: “Yeah, I would have thought so. “That would be obvious I think if you looked at our squad then that is an area of the pitch we would need to look to strengthen.”",

It was during a stop in play and Devlin looked rather bewildered after Shankland reacted strongly. But the Aussie midfielder insists it isn’t anything to worry about. Hearts lost 2-0 at the Parken Stadium in the end as Devlin explained: “Hey, I know. We were laughing. We were arguing about a complete misunderstanding. “He thought I was throwing the ball because he didn’t get it. But I was throwing the ball because I didn’t hit him with the pass. “We’ve kissed and made up in there. We’re out there. We’re losing. We both want to win. You can see how hard we all try. “At the end of the day, if you don’t see that, then you’d probably start asking questions as to why we’re not getting into each other. But it’s only passion. “We both just want to win for the team. We’ve kissed and made up. It was just a misunderstanding. We were arguing about completely different things. “He thought I was going long but I tried to play him and I missed the pass. And then I got angry at myself because I missed the pass. He thought I was angry at him for not getting it. “That’s just football. I feel like you’ve got to be passionate. You’ve got to yell at your team-mates. If they do well, get into them. If they do bad, get into them. “Because they say you get the best out of each other. We’re fine. We could argue properly and then get in there and have a hug and a kiss and we’d be fine.” It’s a bottom of the Premiership table clash between Kilmarnock and Hearts next for the Jambos, but one eye is definitely on Petrocub next week at Tyencastle, as a win is likely to secure progression to the knockout play-off round. Devlin said: “It hasn’t been a great start to the season by any stretch. We’re nowhere near where we want to be in the league. We haven’t got a result in our last three Conference games. “First and foremost, Sunday is all we think about now. We need to get a result and start climbing up that table. I think that goes without saying. Then we’ll look to Thursday when we’re at home. “More than likely, if we win, we will go through. You have to be confident. We’re at home. All the home games we’ve had, we’ve done really well. “Look at Heidenheim, another great team, but I feel in the first half if we score our chances we probably go in 2-0 up at half-time and you never know. “It’s about picking ourselves up like we have had to do a lot this season. Just be men. When you’re at a club like Hearts, I’ve said it before, you have to stand up in these moments. “You’re not walking away with your tail between your legs as such because of the calibre of opposition, I feel anyway. I feel like we did everything we could and probably got beat by a better team.”",

The Jambos were left fuming on Thursday night when Copenhagen were handed the chance to seal three Europa Conference League points late in the game. They held a 1-0 lead and were then awarded a penalty after Craig Gordon was deemed to have controversially fouled Amin Chiakha inside the area. On-field referee Andrea Colombo pointed to the spot after a VAR review and it left Hearts boss Neil Critchley and Gordon in particular feeling extremely aggrieved. Kevin Diks converted from 12 yards and it put the game out of sight from a Hearts point of view. Critchley branded the decision ‘really poor’ while Gordon was baffled as to why he wasn’t given a free-kick instead of a foul the other way. But Neestrup is having none of that and thinks there was clear contact from Gordon. The Copenhagen boss also thinks regardless of the penalty award, his team would have saw out the win. Neestrup said: “I think it’s a penalty. Amin touched the ball and then the goalie… there’s a collision. “To be honest, as I said to the Danish journalists, I think it’s ridiculous to talk about that penalty because it was not decisive for the game. “As the game went on, we would have won that game nine out of 10 times anyway.” “With all respect, I think we have total control of the game from second one to the last second”, added Neestrup. “We expected maybe that there would be a little bit more bite back, but that’s not a disrespect for Hearts. “An amazing club, by the way, and a great team, but I just think that we kept ourselves on an extremely high level and showed the difference that has to be between FC Copenhagen and Hearts. “But do you know what? This game we played today has been exactly the same in our two previous home games against Jagiellonia and Istanbul. “But for some reason we have only managed to get one point. But it’s actually been exactly the same game picture. “So we needed those three points today because we have lost five in our two home games before that.”",

The Croatian topped the charts for the goals prevented stat by some distance, ahead of Matt Freese who still deserves a mention for his performances with New York City this season. This more advanced stat, based on xGOT faced, is linked to expected goals and assigns a number between zero and one to each shot on target faced based on its likelihood of finding the net. The number of goals conceded is then subtracted from the total xGOT faced to give an idea of how many shots a goalkeeper is saving that they might not be expected to — hence “goals prevented”.   Kahlina also topped more traditional goalkeeping metrics such as save percentage (76%) and clean sheets (13) even though the latter is more of a team defensive stat. The Charlotte goalkeeper was named Goalkeeper of the Year in this year’s MLS awards, receiving 35% of the votes. If anything, it’s surprising this percentage wasn’t higher.  Moreira was named Defender of the Year for his performances on the right of the Crew’s back three. Though this means he’s classed as a centre-back, his job is as much about what Columbus does with the ball as it is defending without it. Playing right-back for much of his career before joining the Crew has helped his adaptation to this fairly specific role. One could imagine him playing effectively as a right-back in a back four who also contributes to build-up play, as he will do in our imaginary XI.   When it comes to pure defensive work, Yeimar remains one of the best central defenders in MLS. Seattle conceded the fewest goals in the league during the 2024 season, and Yeimar’s partnership with Jackson Ragen in the middle of the Sounders’ backline played a big part in that. His proactive defending also takes some burden off the midfield, and he led MLS for interceptions in 2024 with 63.  Robinson has played as part of a back three for Cincinnati this season, and showed he is still among the most highly regarded centre-backs in the league even while not being at his absolute best. Robinson ranks well in FotMob’s season performance data for duels, both from tackling and aerial ability. Cincinnati had the third best defence in the Eastern Conference behind the already mentioned Charlotte and Columbus.  Alba’s availability and consistency made him one of the more reliable members of Inter Miami’s star cast. He was third in the team for total minutes played and finished the season having scored five goals and made 11 assists. His retirement from international duty in 2023 increased his availability in a league which plays through international breaks and he played a big role in his team’s record-breaking regular season.   Busquets, like Alba, was one of the strongholds of this Supporters’ Shield-winning Inter Miami season. There was the odd shaky moment as the defensive side of Inter Miami’s team was often left in the lurch by the understandable focus on attack, but overall he was a steady, important presence. A combination of defensive nous and link-up play in possession meant he was often the player that made the whole thing work for Miami.  The veneration of Puig during the MLS Cup final showed how important he has been to LA Galaxy this season, despite an ACL injury keeping him out of the MLS Cup final itself. The Spaniard is the best footballer in the league not named Messi, and has been instrumental in LA Galaxy’s turnaround this season, orchestrating their play from midfield.   The outgoing Whitecaps head coach Vanni Sartini once said of Gauld: “In the last 5, 6, 7 games he’s almost MVP level. Some other guys are more flashy, maybe. He’s what I call a working-class DP.” It sums up Gauld’s contributions in Vancouver where he has always been up among the best players in the league since joining in 2021. There was more of the same from the Scottish attacker in 2024 as he scored 15 goals and made 12 assists across MLS regular season and post-season in 2024 this year.  Despite finishing 15th in the overall standings, Portland scored the fourth-most goals in MLS in 2024, partly because Evander was one of the league’s most productive attacking players. Only Luciano Acosta registered more assists than Evander across the regular season and playoffs, and only Messi had more goals plus assists combined in the regular season.  Having missed a large part of the season through a combination of injury and international call-ups, there was plenty of debate around whether Messi had played enough games to be considered for the MVP award, but on a per-game basis, his stats broke MLS records. He was voted the league’s MVP in 2024 on the back of votes from the media and his fellow players, and his stats and performances in the 22 MLS appearances he did make in 2024 make it difficult to argue against them.   While Puig is the second-best footballer in the league after Messi, Cucho has been the second-best player in terms of performance levels in 2024, so much so that he led the MLS MVP vote among technical staff at MLS clubs. His defensive work is almost as impressive as his attacking numbers, as he’s one of the best in the league at winning the ball in the attacking third. He led the league for shots per 90 in 2024, scored 19 goals, and made 11 assists.

Combining the data with the eye test, here is a look at the players in each category, and an assessment of the award winners already announced.  The headline award of the season is the only one for which the winner has yet to be announced. A lot of the data suggests Lionel Messi is the obvious choice for this award, but it’s not that simple. He has the highest average FotMob rating, is second in the goalscoring charts, is joint top for goals and assists combined, averages more than one goal per 90 minutes, and leads the way for expected goals plus expected assists per 90.   Despite all of this, his lack of game time has left the MVP award discussion open to other contenders who have appeared more regularly throughout the season. The most notable among these is the regularly impressive Cucho Hernández of Columbus Crew, while there are also outside shouts for Golden Boot winner Christian Benteke of DC Untied, Evander of Portland, and Messi’s Inter Miami teammate Luis Suárez. Messi started just 15 of his team’s 34 regular season games (the awards are judged on the regular season and not the playoffs) and made four appearances off the bench. There was a point as the season came to a close when he hadn’t played the required amount of games or minutes to appear on many statistical leaderboards. A flurry of appearances towards the end of the season remedied that, and scoring eight goals in seven appearances to round off the campaign also helped. Those per 90 numbers show how good he’s been in the games he has played. His goals per 90 of 1.21 and his goals plus assists per 90 of 1.82 are the highest in MLS regular season history.   It has been more of the same Messi we’ve been used to seeing light up games with Barcelona, Paris Saint-Germain, and Argentina. Despite playing in a lower standard of league, his performances have been so good that he can count himself unlucky not to have been included on the shortlist for the Ballon d’Or, especially as he has the requisite big international tournament honour to his name in 2024 after winning Copa America with Argentina.  This is the second big award that came down to a choice between Columbus Crew and Inter Miami. Tata Martino deserves credit for guiding Inter Miami through a run of nine games without Messi and winning eight of them. Regardless of the talent at his disposal, winning the MLS Supporters’ Shield with a record-breaking points total is no easy feat.  It’s also easy to forget that such a season for Inter Miami was not widely predicted. Of the 17 experts asked by the official MLS website for their predictions at the start of the season, 14 had Inter Miami finishing between 3rd and 7th in the Eastern Conference, and only three had them winning it. This is why the eventual winner, Columbus Crew’s Wilfried Nancy, was not the most obvious choice for some. The Crew won the MLS Cup last season and the Leagues Cup in 2024, but these two trophies are not quite enough to call them an all-time great MLS team. That said, this Crew side can comfortably be called one of the best teams we’ve ever seen in MLS, and much of this is down to the coaching of Nancy and the way the players have responded to it.   They also managed to maintain a challenge in the league for much of the season while also embarking on deep runs in the Concacaf Champions League and Leagues Cup, which is not an easy feat with MLS roster restrictions. If there’s one non-Messi game you’d want to watch each week in MLS (and as mentioned earlier, there were quite a few of those) it would be Nancy’s Columbus Crew. They have transcended the league and are simply a great team to watch in world football. Few MLS teams have ever managed this, and this is why Nancy deserves the award.  Columbus Crew’s style of play has also influenced Defender of the Year voting and led to many a debate on what defines good defending. The Crew’s Steven Moreira would have been my pick and eventually won the award, but he was not an obvious choice when it came to defensive work. Given this award also includes full-backs, many of whose defensive duties became a secondary part of their game long ago, giving it to a central defender would initially seem like a safe, more traditional option. But Moreira’s style of play in the Crew setup — in which he’s involved in the build-up play and bursting forward from his position as a right centre-back in a three — leads to a data profile that doesn’t look much like a defender. The Crew’s control of possession also means there isn’t as much traditional defensive work to do in areas such as tackling and intercepting. Seattle centre-backs Yeimar Gómez Andrade and Jackson Regen were more obvious candidates from a purely defensive standpoint. Yeimar led MLS for interceptions (63 in 30 starts) and Seattle had the best defence in the league.   Defensive data alone would see the award go to Yeimar, and it would be deserved, but Moreira emerging as the winner shows there are more ways to defend with the ball in the modern game.  The goalkeeper award picks itself both from the eye test and from the stats. For much of the season, New York City’s number one Matt Freese was neck and neck with Kristijan Kahlina but the Charlotte man continued his extraordinary form right until the end. Bafflingly, neither Freese nor Kahlina made the MLS All-Star game this season, while Freese didn’t make the three finalists for goalkeeper of the year. Maybe goalkeeping is a blind spot for MLS judges, but there was no doubting who would eventually win the award. That said, it’s a surprise Kahlina only gained 35% of the overall vote from players, clubs, and the media combined. Hugo Lloris of Los Angeles FC got the highest percentage of a the player vote with 16% with Kahlina at just 11%.   This award was between Gabriel Pec of LA Galaxy and Inter Miami’s Suárez. Pec won out thanks to a highly productive season, easily reaching double figures for goals and assists, with 19 goals and 15 assists so far as the Galaxy continue in the playoffs. The Brazilian played a big role in LA Galaxy’s transformation this season, which was arguably more impressive than Inter Miami’s. Pec has the fourth-highest average rating in MLS, behind Messi, teammate Ricqui Puig, and Evander.  Andres Gomes would likely have been the young player of the year had he not left Real Salt Lake midway through the season. His teammate Diego Luna eventually, and deservedly, won the award for being part of the RSL team that maintained a good position in the West despite losing Gomes and a late downturn in form from top scorer Cristian Arango. However, the eligible player with the highest average rating is Philadelphia Union’s Jack McGlynn. The creative midfielder who likes to shoot from long range was probably overlooked due to the Union’s disappointing season and will be hoping he and his team can produce better results in 2025.   This is not an award to be judged on statistics as it’s often about a player overcoming a difficult period, usually an injury, and making a successful return. My vote would have gone to Inter Miami’s Ian Fray, who made 14 appearances and played 643 minutes this season after coming back from three serious knee injuries. Sadly, Fray picked up a meniscus injury in the playoffs, but given the timing of it before the off-season break, he should be back next year. The eventual winner, Lewis Morgan of the New York Red Bulls, had to overcome his own injury issues.  It was almost miraculous that he returned in 2024 looking like the player he was prior to a hip operation in September 2023 that, according to MLS, gave him just a 20-25% chance of returning to peak performance. There was even a 15% chance that he might not play again. His performances were so good, they earned him regular call-ups to the Scotland squad which can be difficult when playing in a non-European league like MLS.  Such a comeback was not an easy one and the award was fully deserved. The role he’s played for the team as they make their unlikely playoff run further reinforces this.

Thank you as always for your participation! I'm only going to review the data in this article, so if you want to see the full results for yourself, you can see those here. As I started writing this, I realized I never did an analysis of last year's survey. Since that's long gone, the recap is that the fans and front office basically acted in unison, with nothing too interesting to note. This year I'm writing this before the club announces their roster decisions, so I will likely do a follow up article with any notable differences between the Fan GM team and the Real Salt Lake GM team's decisions. I'm going to write this as if I'm writing the press release after you, the GM, have handed me the decisions from on high. Obviously this won't be super professional, but it'll give a nice summary of what you have voted to do before we dive into some analysis. So, without further ado... Press Release Ending the 2024 season, the RSL Fanbase General Management Board has made the following contract decisions. Included are the % of the Board who voted for the decision taken. Players not returning for 2025 are: Tomas Gomez - GK - Out of Contract - 80.4% Delentz Pierre - DF - Club Option Declined - 57.6% Erik Holt - DF - Club Option Declined - 86.4% Marcelo Silva - DF - Out of Contract - 82% Maikel Chang - MF - Out of Contract - 88% Benji Michel - FW - Club Option Declined - 58.8% Rubio Rubin - FW - Club Option Declined - 74.4% Additionally, Kevon Lambert's loan with San Antonio FC (USL Championship) has been extended through the 2025 season (65.2%). The following players have had their contract options exercised for 2025: Gavin Beavers - GK - 90.4% Andrew Brody - DF - 40%* Javain Brown - DF - 71.6% Jaziel Orozco - DF - 79.2% Kevin Bonilla - DF - 50.4% Philip Quinton - DF- 86% Tommy Silva - DF - 61.2% Zack Farnsworth - DF - 40.4%* Noel Caliskan - MF - 67.6% Anderson Julio - FW - 82% Bertin Jaquesson - FW - 48%* Ilijah Paul - FW - 49.2%* *While these players did not get a majority of the Board's votes to have their options exercised, the majority of the Board expressed desires for the player to stay via the option or negotiating a new contract, with most of those votes going to the option to be picked up. This resulted in the author moving to exercise their contract options. The Board has also decided to extend Head Coach Pablo Mastroeni's contract for 2025 with 79.1% voting in favor. In addition, team awards have been determined for the 2024 season: MVP - Diego Luna - MF - 35.2% Honorable Mention - Andrés Gómez - MF - 60.4% would have voted him had he not been sold mid-season Defensive Player of the Year - Justen Glad - DF - 29.6% Honorable Mentions - Alex Katranis and Emeka Eneli Newcomer of the Year - Alex Katranis - DF - 69.6% Player to Watch for 2025 - Dominik Marczuk - MF - 31.6% Honorable Mention - Diego Luna - MF - 31.2% The following 12 players are also protected for the 2024 Expansion Draft: Alex Katranis - DF - 97.2% Chicho Arango - FW - 96.8% Emeka Eneli - MF - 94.8% Dominik Marczuk - MF - 93.2% Braian Ojeda - MF - 92.4% Justen Glad - DF - 92.4% Diogo Gonçalves - MF - 85.2% Matt Crooks - MF - 81.6% Anderson Julio - FW - 80% Brayan Vera - DF - 78% Nelson Palacio - MF - 70% Lachlan Brook - MF - 60.4% All complaints may be filed in the comment section below. Analysis I generally tended to agree with the fans on who stays and who goes. Here are my reasonings for why each of the outgoing players was probably selected as such by the fans: Tomas Gomez is a 3rd string goalie and we have plenty of coverage for that spot in the Academy Delentz Pierre hasn't been remarkable with the Monarchs, and wasn't able to get a consistent starting spot out on loan in the USL Fans have wanted Holt gone for years. We now have Quinton as a backup CB who I think is a major upgrade Silva only played in 3 first team games this year before going down with an injury, and didn't touch the field after he returned Chang is one I'm split about. He's definitely on the decline physically but has come in handy off the bench to close out games. But, I think he is in the way of Lachlan Brook and other young wingers getting more minutes Michel played a few games in a pinch, but couldn't sniff the field after Leagues Cup Rubin has been out of favor with the fans for a few years now, and the writing was on the wall for him once he got loaned out to Liga MX side Queretaro for the season The only one of these that is surprising to me is Pierre, as younger players generally get the benefit of the doubt in these surveys. My only hope here if RSL decides to not offer new contracts to Silva or Chang, is that they get a proper send off into retirement. RSL has an unfortunate history of simply parting ways with aging players like Andy from Toy Story 2's classic ""I don't wanna play with you anymore"" line from Woody's nightmare scene. While Chang and Silva don't leave the legacy of the Javier Morales-type legends, they've served diligently though some of the toughest times of this club's history, with Silva captaining most of the 2023 season when Krielach was injured. Chang was also an important part of the 2019 USL Championship winning Monarchs team, the only trophy won by a professional soccer team in Utah since RSL's MLS Cup win in 2009. While it may be time for them to move on from RSL, these two need to be recognized for the important work they've done for this team over the years. Oh, and Rubin gets a shout out for winning the 2021 MLS Goal of the Year, in part thanks to the entire Guatemalan soccer fan base showing up at the polls. It was a sick bike though. With the players whose contract options were exercised, I think it's worth looking at Andrew Brody specifically. The fans were pretty split on what they wanted for him with 40% wanting his option exercised, 33.6% wanting his option declined with no new contract offer, and 26.4% wanting the option declined but a new contract offered. Brody definitely didn't have the best season overall. He's shown vulnerabilities in his speed and recovery, and for most of the year was in a battle with 22 year old Kaysville native Bode Hidalgo, who is just breaking into substantial first team minutes. I think Brody's salary was a big decider for people, with a $300k guaranteed compensation, and the up and coming Hidalgo generally performing better on the right flank (6.81 vs 6.94 FotMob ratings respectively), I think it makes sense for a decent chunk of fans to want a reduced contract for Brody. Take that and factor in Javain Brown's emergence at the end of the season as a viable option at right-back, I'd tend to agree that a lower contract would not be a bad idea here. If we let him go though, we'll have to find a new backup left-back unless it's time for one of the academy kids to jump into that spot (Tommy Silva, Luis Rivera, Zack Farnsworth, I'm looking at you!). I don't think that I need to comment on Mastroeni's vote beyond saying that you don't just fire a coach after a record setting season, even if we did fizzle out of the Playoffs, Leagues Cup, and Open Cup. Let the man cook unless there are massive problems with the locker room we don't know about. There were 4 major contenders for MVP, with Luna coming out on top with 35.2% of the vote. Chicho came in 2nd place with 28.4%, Eneli in 3rd with 18%, and Ojeda in 4th with 12.8%. A major shoutout to the two defensive midfielders here, as DM's are hardly ever in MVP conversations, and I think it shows just how important they were to RSL's impressive season. I really think the award going to Luna has quite a bit of recency bias since Chicho's record tying 17 goals came before the Leagues Cup break, and he wasn't able to find good form after his suspension and injuries. Luna was the stalwart for the year, consistently having good performances and really trying to carry the team on his back when things weren't clicking after Leagues Cup. The team award ended up going to Eneli, but Luna was a solid shout by the fans. Which leads to the next question about Andrés Gómez. The fact that 60.4% of the respondents said that if he was still on the team, he would have been their MVP is impressive. The young Colombian was excellent and we never really found our footing after he left. Let's hope that the offseason can help Dominik Marczuk fill the void Gómez left and build a good connection to Chicho so we can find a little more of that magic in 2025. And major props to both Marczuk and Gómez for getting their first senior level international goals this week! Glad as Defensive Player of the Year doesn't surprise me. He was one of the few consistent pieces of a broken backline that limped across the finish line at the end of the season. I wouldn't say it was his best year, but I think he's a solid choice by the fanbase. Second place fell to Katranis, who had a solid debut season and was justly awarded with Newcomer of the Year in my opinion. Eneli came in with a solid 3rd place showing with 23.6% of the vote. Again, he and Ojeda had an incredible season and Eneli really impressed. Brayan Vera was off in a distant 4th place on this one. I don't think his 3 game suspension at the end of the year for spitting did him any favors. The team’s vote and the fans’ vote was the same on this one! As I mentioned before, Katranis won the Newcomer of the Year award by a LANDSLIDE with 69.6% of the vote. The next closest was Matt Crooks with 18.4%. Considering how important Katranis was to how we played, and how he won us some games with a few bangers along the way, I'm not surprised in the slightest that he won. I think his on-field attitude also endeared him to fans. He had a Kyle Beckerman-esque edge of determination and physicality on the field, never backed down from a fight, but was mature enough to keep his cool and not get ejected. Not only was he a great fit for the team's tactics, but he embodies what Utah sports fans want in a player. Hats off to him for a great debut season. There was only one vote separating Marczuk and Luna from being the ""players to watch"" for 2025. Marczuk edged this one out for the win, but I think this vote is very telling for how the fans see the arrival of the new signings this summer, as well as the continuation of the old guard. Marczuk was the only summer signing who really felt like he gelled with the team. I'd say that Brown was a close second, but he did have the advantage of already having MLS experience. Marczuk brought energy and maturity beyond his years as he filled in the gap Gómez left, but it was obvious that he had room to grow. I think that's why he was a top pick here. Luna is the same young dynamic player profile as Marczuk, but we know what he's capable of, and we know he's capable of growing more. While it's highly likely that he'll be sold abroad before we see him come to his full potential at RSL, the idea of having a young superstar in our ranks that grew into his stardom at RSL is exciting, and clearly RSL fans have plenty of hopes that he'll stay at least one more season to delight us with his creativity and Bluey sweaters. My most anticipated part of this survey was the Expansion Draft Protection List. I was so curious to see who people would protect, and it honestly differed from my list a bit! Just so you don't have to scroll back up, here's ""the Board's"" list of 12 players that they want protected from the draft: Alex Katranis - DF - 97.2% Chicho Arango - FW - 96.8% Emeka Eneli - MF - 94.8% Dominik Marczuk - MF - 93.2% Braian Ojeda - MF - 92.4% Justen Glad - DF - 92.4% Diogo Gonçalves - MF - 85.2% Matt Crooks - MF - 81.6% Anderson Julio - FW - 80% Brayan Vera - DF - 78% Nelson Palacio - MF - 70% Lachlan Brook - MF - 60.4% Now here's my list (I was the first one to fill out the survey, so it's really easy to find). I've emphasized the names that differ from ""the Board's"" selections: Alexandros Katranis Brayan Vera Justen Glad Philip Quinton (in place of Anderson Julio, received 32.9% of the vote, 14th ranked) Chicho Arango Emeka Eneli Braian Ojeda Pablo Ruiz (in place of Nelson Palacio, received 54.4% of the vote, 13th ranked) Diogo Gonçalves Dominik Marczuk Lachlan Brook Matt Crooks The fact that so many people voted in favor of generally the same group I think speaks to the general fanbase accepting that those are the best/better players on the roster. I wouldn't be surprised if that's the list we see on December 11th to be honest! But I will make my arguments on why my differing picks should be the ones there. Feel free to tear me apart in the comments. This might be my biggest hot take of the article, but for me Philip Quinton is one of the most important roster pieces to keep for 2025. With Silva and Holt likely gone, he's the default 3rd center back, and can hold his own at right back if we need him to. Behind him we'd have Brown and then academy kids that haven't been proven yet, so I'd like to keep him around for security. He's also on a dirt cheap salary ($89,716). I think he's a guy that if not protected will get snatched up in a heartbeat after the types of performances he's put in this year combined with that salary. I'd take him over Julio specifically because while we don't have a ton of backup options at forward, we have some prospects to give a chance (Kei and Gozo come to mind) and with Julio's higher salary, it wouldn't be bad to free up some cap space if he got taken. For Ruiz, before he was injured in 2023, he was in early season league MVP conversations, and he was slated to be a key player in 2024 based on comments from Pablo Mastroeni and Kurt Schmit's post-season press conference. I also think he is better than Palacio in every way and we don't want to just give up that level of player like this. Now, he does have a very high salary at $900k which wouldn't be bad to free up in the cap, but I think he's much more of a pivotal player to what we can be in 2025 and beyond than Julio is so taking the salary hit is more reasonable in my book. I'd protect him over Palacio simply because he's a better player. Palacio has had good moments, but overall has been rather underwhelming since joining from Ateltico Nacional in 2023, at times not even able to find the field as the 3rd defensive midfielder in the depth chart. For me, Palacio's had time to prove himself and hasn't done enough for me to be above Ruiz in the list of players we should protect. The unknown here is how Ruiz comes back from two massive knee injuries in two years. If he can channel anything close to what we saw in the first half of 2023, I'd take him in a heartbeat over Palacio. What do you think? Are the fans right in their decisions? Were you one of the 4 people who think we should let Gavin Beavers walk instead of picking him up for another year, or buy out Diogo Gonçalves from his DP contract after 4 months? Let's keep the conversation going in the comments! I'll probably make a follow up once the actual roster decisions drop if there are any differences worth discussing, so keep an eye out for that in the coming weeks.

Having recorded a 2-1 victory at home in Game 1, the Supporters’ Shield winners had a chance to book their place in the Eastern Conference semifinals on Saturday. However, they were punished for a lacklustre performance at Mercedez-Benz Stadium, only recording two shots on target throughout the match. The Herons did take a 40th-minute lead when David Martinez scored a bizarre opener, dinking his shot into an empty net following a slip from Atlanta goalkeeper Brad Guzan. However, Derrick Williams headed a 58th-minute equaliser and Atlanta struck the decisive blow four minutes into stoppage time, Xande Silva coming off the bench to fire home from the edge of the box and prevent a penalty shoot-out. The teams will now reconvene for a third game next week, with Messi and Miami requiring a home win to keep their campaign alive.  New York City also forced a decider in their series against FC Cincinnati, clinching a 3-1 home victory with goals from Alonso Martinez, Thiago Martins and Santiago Rodriguez. Martinez put them ahead with a cool finish midway through the first half, with Martins adding a deserved second just before the interval, taking advantage of some poor defending to score with a free header at the far post. Cincinnati were given hope of a comeback when Luca Orellano curled a wonderful strike into the top-left corner, but Rodriguez converted a stoppage-time penalty to ensure NYCFC kept the tie alive. In the last of Saturday’s games, Minnesota United recorded a second penalty shoot-out win over Real Salt Lake in the space of four days to advance to the Western Conference semifinals. Joseph Rosales’ placed effort gave Minnesota a second-half lead just four minutes after Brayan Vera’s deflected strike was disallowed for an offside in the build-up at the other end.  Emeka Eneli prodded home 15 minutes from time to take the game to spot-kicks, but Real Salt Lake came up short from 12 yards once again, failing to score with three straight kicks in a 3-1 loss. Minnesota goalkeeper Dayne St. Clair repelled efforts from Diogo Goncalves and Diego Luna either side of Matt Crooks blazing over the top, allowing Jeong Sang-bin to score the decisive kick for the Loons, who will face the LA Galaxy in the next round.

The Albiceleste bounced back from a shock defeat to Paraguay, with the Inter striker's 55th-minute effort enough to extend their lead at the top of the table to five points. Argentina started brightly and almost took the lead with their first real opportunity, only for Julian Alvarez's powerful strike to rebound off the outside of the post. Alexis Mac Allister also came close moments later and rose high to meet Alvarez's cross, though he could only glance his header wide. Martinez, who netted his 32nd Argentina goal to go joint-fifth in the all-time scoring chart, proved decisive in the second half, acrobatically volleying Lionel Messi's cross into the back of the net.

Lautaro Martinez had given Argentina the lead in the 11th minute – his powerful shot past Roberto Fernandez was initially ruled out for offside before a VAR review overturned it. However, Paraguay were soon back on level terms. Gustavo Gomez rattled the crossbar with a diving header from a corner, but they regathered possession and pulled level with a sublime overhead kick from Antonio Sanabria 19 minutes in. Two minutes into the second half, the hosts completed the turnaround through Omar Alderete, who met Diego Gomez's precise free-kick to nod in from close range. Rodrigo De Paul arguably should have equalised for Argentina with just over 20 minutes to go, but under pressure, sliced over from close range, with the visitors unable to salvage a point.

""I'm not here to criticise my players; I'm here to support them,"" Scaloni said. ""We knew it was going to be a tough match. We're here to move forward. ""In the first half, we played a good game, but the first action at the start of the second half made everything more difficult. We have to congratulate the opponent, who defended very well. ""I don't know if they found the antidote [to beating Argentina]. We're hoping to get back on the positive path. ""The team always tries and stands tall. That's what's important: never giving up on the game and always having the desire to compete.""

Real Madrid midfielder Federico Valverde opened the scoring 10 minutes into the first half, curling into the bottom corner from the edge of the area to put Uruguay a goal up. But seven minutes later, Gerson scored his first goal for his country to level things up, a brilliant volley from outside the box. The draw has Uruguay in second place, two points above Brazil, who could have won it if not for Sergio Rochet's fine save to deny Gabriel Martinelli, and five behind leaders Argentina with six matches remaining. Data debrief: Brazil struggle to break down Bielsa's Uruguay Despite Raphinha, Vinicius Junior and Gabriel Martinelli all featuring in this game, Brazil could not find the quality to regularly trouble their visitors. The home side managed just three shots on target during the match – one more than Uruguay. While they won the xG battle 1.09 - 0.47, it will be a disappointment that they had 18 attempts in total and could only divert so few goalwards.

However, they climbed to second in the CONMEBOL qualification group – ahead of Colombia on goal difference – by edging a five-goal thriller in Montevideo. Andres Gomez's 96th-minute strike had appeared to salvage a point for Colombia, but Ugarte volleyed home following a knock-down from Facundo Pellistri mere moments after Uruguay had kicked off again.

""They have a well-oiled style of play; they defend, press, manage the ball, and have individual brilliance, which makes them a tough rival to beat. ""It's not easy to win against this opponent, as they have physically gifted, technically proficient players across all positions, many of whom can change the game's dynamics."" Next up, Uruguay face Brazil, with the Selecao languishing in fourth after they played out a frustrating 1-1 draw with Venezuela on Thursday. Bielsa, however, is under no illusions regarding the magnitude of the task awaiting his team in Salvador on Tuesday. ""If Colombia is an athletically strong team with an offensively capable system that creates danger and has organisation in possession, Brazil has that and more,"" he said.  ""We will try to control the ball in their half and not ours.

While the Maldini clan is the best-known example, they’re far from the only family with three consecutive generations representing a national team.  The apple doesn’t always fall far from the tree, and that’s certainly been the case in the Mihaylov family tree. Biser Mihaylov spent 14 years at PFC Levski Sofia between 1961 and 1975, excelling between the sticks, leading them to four league titles, and making five international appearances. His son Borislav began his career at Levski Sofia and quickly solidified a starting spot in goal for Bulgaria, becoming their most-capped player with 102 appearances (later eclipsed by Stiliyan Petrov), and captaining them in their run in the 1994 FIFA World Cup semifinals, while his son Nikolay has gone on to become a regular in goal for both Levski Sofia and Bulgaria (46 caps).  Whilst the Mihaylovs have earned a reputation for their imperviousness in goal, the Guðjohnsens have made a name for themselves due to their attacking firepower. Three years after having the final penalty of the UEFA Cup Final saved by Tottenham’s Tony Parks, Arnór Guðjohnsen bounced back by finishing as the top scorer in Belgium’s top division with 19 goals in 1986/87. But whilst he scored 14 goals in 73 appearances for Iceland, he does have one regret: not playing with his son. Arnór looked set to make history by playing alongside his 17-year-old son Eiður on April 24, 1996, only for Iceland FA president Eggert Magnússon to demand manager Logi Ólafsson to not play them together, instead preferring the moment to take place on home soil in their next match vs. Macedonia two months later. Eiður replaced his 34-year-old father at halftime, and one month later, he broke his ankle while playing for Iceland’s U-18s. By the time he returned two years later, Arnór had retired. Eiður is regarded as the greatest Icelandic footballer of all time, winning two league titles at Chelsea and a treble with Barcelona, scoring 26 goals in 88 appearances for Iceland, and his children are keeping the fire burning: Sveinn Aron (26) has scored 2 goals in 20 caps for Iceland, Andri (22) has registered 7 goals in 28 appearances, whilst Daníel (18) has already represented them at the U16, U17 and U19 level.   Albert Guðmundsson is the latest in a long line of Guðmundssons who have made their mark for Iceland. His great-grandfather Albert was Iceland’s first professional footballer and played for the likes of Arsenal, Milan and Rangers before serving as Minister of Finance of Iceland and Minister of Industry and producing a son: Ingi Björn Albertsson, the second-all-time leading scorer in Iceland’s top-flight with 126 goals. Not only have both Albert’s maternal great-grandfather and maternal grandfather played for Iceland, but so too have both of his parents: Guðmundur Benediktsson scored twice in 10 appearances, whilst his mother Kristbjörg Helga Ingadóttir held the record for most goals in Icelandic’s top division from 1987 to 2012. Each of the four generations of the Guðmundssons have scored for Iceland, and with 10 goals in 37 caps, Albert is proudly keeping that tradition alive.  Unlike his grandfather Salvinu, who scored one goal in three Malta appearances, or his father Eric, who scored zero in three, André Schembri would not only play more than three times for Ħomor, but play overseas, bouncing around Europe before finally retiring in 2020 after a season in India. In total, the Maltese striker scored 131 goals in 446 appearances at club level and 3 goals in 94 appearances at international level, and he began his managerial career this summer after taking charge of Cypriot second-tier side Anagennisi Deryneia.  On June 19, 1954, 22-year-old Mexican striker Tomás Balcázar scored in the 85th minute to equalize in a World Cup group stage match, but Raymond Kopa immediately restored France’s advantage from the penalty spot in a 3-2 win. On June 17, 2020, Tomás’ grandson, 22-year-old Mexican striker Javier ‘Chicharito’ Hernández, would open the scoring against France as El Tri prevailed with a famous 2-0 victory in the World Cup group stage. Unlike his maternal grandfather, who won 8 league titles in a decade with Chivas and scored 6 goals in 11 appearances for Mexico, Chicharito left Guadalajara at an early age and joined Manchester United, where he would participate in a Champions League Final and win two Premier League titles. He is the all-time leading scorer for Mexico with 52 goals in 109 appearances, well ahead of his father Javier ‘Chicharo’ Hernández (4 goals in 28). And he’s still going – having made an emotional return to Chivas earlier this year.   You’d be hard-pressed to find a Northern Irish family with deeper footballing roots than the Feeneys. Jim Feeney helped Linfield win three wartime league championships and represented Ireland twice in wartime internationals, whilst his son Warren made his sole appearance for Northern Ireland in 1976. Warren James Feeney would suit up for them over a quarter-century later, making 46 appearances for the Green and White Army between 2002 and 2011. George Feeney doesn’t turn 17 until January, but he’s already made his professional debut under his father Warren James for Glentoran and earned a move to Tottenham’s academy. However, it remains to be seen whether or not George will continue the long-lasting Feeney dominance: after playing for Northern Ireland’s U16 and U17 sides, he switched allegiances to Wales and debuted for their U16 side in March.  Few names are as synonymous with Bodø/Glimt as the Bergs. Harald Berg spent the bulk of his playing career at Bodø/Glimt, finishing as top scorer in the 1965 Eliteserien season and scoring an impressive 12 goals in 43 caps for Norway as a midfielder. His grandson Patrick left his boyhood club in December 2021 and joined Ligue 1 outfit Lens for €4.5 million, only to return eight months later. At 26 years old, Patrick has already accumulated 271 appearances for Bodø/Glimt, bettered only by five players in their history, including his uncle Runar (2nd – 317), whilst he’s also played 29 times for Norway. Patrick’s uncles Ariid and Runar, great uncle Knut, and father Ørjan have all represented Bodø/Glimt – Ørjan racked up 19 caps for Norway and now serves as Bodø/Glimt’s sporting director. Patrick sat down for an interview with us a couple of years ago, where he discussed the weight of his name. You can read that – here.    Whilst he only played three matches for Czechoslovakia, Vladimír Weiss won a silver medal in the 1964 Olympics in Tokyo. His son Vladimír achieved 19 caps with Czechoslovakia and 12 with Slovakia, and like his father, he also transitioned into coaching, guiding Slovan Bratislava to the last four league titles. Unlike his father and grandfather, who never left Czechoslovakia in their playing days, the third Vladimír joined Manchester City’s academy in 2006 but failed to establish himself in the first team before eventually leaving in 2012. He played for four different clubs in Europe and Asia before linking up with his father in 2020, and whilst his national career has come to an end after 8 goals in 77 caps, he is still going strong at 34 and playing a pivotal role in Slovan Bratislava’s domestic supremacy.  Marcos ‘Marquitos’ Alonso emerged as a brick wall in defense for Real Madrid and helped them win six league titles and five European Cups between 1954 and 1962, but whilst he played 215 times for Los Blancos, he only played twice for Spain. His son Marcos developed in Real Madrid’s academy but wasn’t able to make the step up to the first team, proceeding to represent two of Real’s biggest rivals in Barcelona and Atlético Madrid and win a league title and reach a European Cup Final with Barça. He made 22 caps for Spain and was an unused squad member in their run to the 1984 Euros Final, whilst his son Marcos achieved 9 caps for Spain and won the Premier League, Champions League, and Europa League with Chelsea. Like his father, Marcos was unable to ascend from La Fábrica to the first team and left Real in search of minutes, before going on to play for Barcelona, where he would win the 2022/23 LaLiga title.   Whilst he only played twice for Uruguay in 1928, Juan Carlos Corazzo would end up managing La Celeste on four separate occasions, including in the 1962 FIFA World Cup. Corazzo held the record for most consecutive Uruguay games without defeat (14) from 1968 to 2012 until being surpassed by Óscar Tabárez, whilst his son-in-law Pablo Forlán would play 17 times for Uruguay and participate in the 1966 and 1974 FIFA World Cup. Unlike his father Pablo, whose resolute displays in defense powered Peñarol to four league titles and a Copa Libertadores championship, Diego Forlán made a name for himself in attack. Diego was 12 when his sister Alejandra was left handicapped in a car accident, and the cost of these medical bills plunged his family into a financial crisis that was only averted when Diego Maradona stepped in and assisted with the fundraising efforts. Forlán decided to abandon tennis and focus solely on football in hopes of being able to pay for his sister’s treatment one day. The rest, as they say, is history. Forlán would go on to win the European Golden Shoe in 2005 and 2009 with Villarreal and Atlético Madrid, score 36 goals in 112 appearances for Uruguay, and become the first Uruguayan to reach 100 caps, whilst he was also Uruguay’s all-time leading scorer for two years before Luis Suárez leapfrogged him. One year after leading Uruguay to the 2010 FIFA World Cup semifinals and being named the tournament’s best player, he ended a year-long goal drought for Uruguay by scoring a brace vs. Paraguay in the 2011 Copa América Final and guiding them to their first trophy in 16 years. In doing so, he followed in the footsteps of his grandfather, who won the Copa as a manager in 1959 and 1967, and his father, who won it as a player in 1967. It remains to be seen if either of Diego’s sons Martín (8) or his César (5) will continue the trend, but one thing’s for sure: the Forlán name will always be remembered fondly by Uruguay supporters.

""I admit, this injury is the one that shook me the most in my career.  ""I was really sad, and very down mentally for the first month. I knew it was a serious and long-term injury. Being on the sidelines is tough.  ""The beginning of an injury is quite complicated. At the start, you only feel pain.

The Real Madrid winger failed to scoop the accolade despite scoring 24 goals and providing 11 assists last season, as Los Blancos won a LaLiga and Champions League double. The club opted to skip the ceremony after hearing Vinicius Junior would miss out on the top award, which was won by Manchester City and Spain midfielder Rodri. Madrid's decision not to attend generated mixed reviews. City head coach Pep Guardiola empathised with Carlo Ancelotti's side, but LaLiga president Javier Tebas accused them of ""exaggerated victimhood"". Dorival acknowledges Rodri was deserving of the award, having helped City to an unprecedented fourth successive Premier League title before starring Spain's victorious Euro 2024 squad. However, the Selecao boss believes Vinicius has every right to feel aggrieved at missing out. ""In my opinion, [it's] an unfair situation, especially because it is an individual award,"" Dorival told reporters during a press conference. ""Nothing against whoever won the award, quite the opposite. It is the recognition of one of the great players of Spanish football, but Vinicius - for the work he did - should have received different attention. ""But the greatest prize that Vinícius won was the recognition and respect of his people. The vast majority of the Brazilian people realised the injustice that was done to the player who could have deservedly received the award."" Dorival Junior feels Vinicius Junior suffered an ""injustice"" by not winning the Ballon d'Or, as the Brazil head coach slammed the ""unfair situation"". The Real Madrid winger failed to scoop the accolade despite scoring 24 goals and providing 11 assists last season, as Los Blancos won a LaLiga and Champions League double. The club opted to skip the ceremony after hearing Vinicius Junior would miss out on the top award, which was won by Manchester City and Spain midfielder Rodri. Madrid's decision not to attend generated mixed reviews. City head coach Pep Guardiola empathised with Carlo Ancelotti's side, but LaLiga president Javier Tebas accused them of ""exaggerated victimhood"". Dorival acknowledges Rodri was deserving of the award, having helped City to an unprecedented fourth successive Premier League title before starring Spain's victorious Euro 2024 squad. However, the Selecao boss believes Vinicius has every right to feel aggrieved at missing out. ""In my opinion, [it's] an unfair situation, especially because it is an individual award,"" Dorival told reporters during a press conference. ""Nothing against whoever won the award, quite the opposite. It is the recognition of one of the great players of Spanish football, but Vinicius - for the work he did - should have received different attention. ""But the greatest prize that Vinícius won was the recognition and respect of his people. The vast majority of the Brazilian people realised the injustice that was done to the player who could have deservedly received the award."" © Copyright 2024 FotMob",Dorival Junior believes Vinicius Junior has every right to feel aggrieved after missing out on landing this year's Ballon d'Or award.
