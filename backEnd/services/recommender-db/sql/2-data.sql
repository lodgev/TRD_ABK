Earlier this week, the Confederation of African Football approved their 2025 competition calendar and it includes another edition of the Africa Cup of Nations. It is supposed to be a summer tournament but it will take place in the winter yet again, with Morocco playing host from December 21, 2025 to January 18, 2026. For clubs in Europe who enjoy a winter break it will not be as disruptive, but Premier League sides will be in the middle of their busiest time of the year. To put it into some context, Liverpool play seven games in that exact timeframe this season – it could yet rise to eight if the Reds progress to the League Cup semi-final. Currently, Liverpool’s only concern would be losing Salah (yet again), but the No. 11 has yet to extend his contract at the club – though a formal offer has been tabled. It will be a bridge Slot and Co. will only cross if Salah does agree a new deal, but it serves as another reminder that the football calendar does not prioritise players or clubs. The 2025 AFCON falls in the same year as the introduction of FIFA’s new Club World Cup, which will take place over the summer and ask more of players plying their trade at the highest level. Earlier this year, the Press Association reported that clubs could block call-ups to either competition due to FIFA rules, but that could jeopardise relations with players. Last season Salah missed five games for Liverpool whilst at AFCON, he picked up an injury with Egypt and missed a subsequent seven matches, looking half the player he was before he left on return. It is one of many cautionary tales and could consequently make clubs think twice about pursuing African players in the upcoming transfer windows. The Reds have been linked to Egypt forward Omar Marmoush, though Eintracht Frankfurt insist there has been “no contact” over a possible transfer. Whether Salah signs a new contract or not, Liverpool will be expected to be without the winger for the festive schedule next season – but let’s hope that is all he will be absent for!

The Reds are a victory away from a semi-final berth on Wednesday evening, but Slot has already confirmed that “it’s going to be a game where not all our starters will start.” The Dutchman noted that a “few starters” will keep their place but we should expect rotation to the XI and a host of changes later in the game. With Andy Robertson (suspended), Kostas Tsimikas (ankle), Ibrahima Konate (knee) and Conor Bradley (hamstring) unavailable, opportunities are to open up for several young players. A potential quartet to do so have zero starts for Liverpool between them, but incredibly two of them have League Cup winners’ medals to their names already. Trey Nyoni (17), Amara Nallo (18), Jayden Danns (18) and James Norris (21) will all be considered to play a role – combined they have nine first-team appearances off the bench. Early team news from the Times‘ Paul Joyce suggests Nyoni is set to make his full debut at St Mary’s in a midfield that will likely include Alexis Mac Allister and Tyler Morton. The 17-year-old was part of the League Cup-winning squad last season and was used off the bench in the previous round of the competition by Slot, playing the final 26 minutes at Brighton. Danns, meanwhile, has only recently returned to academy action after a long-term back injury but will be under consideration, while centre-back Nallo and left-back Norris could have big roles to play. Nallo, an aggressive defender without any first-team outing, was on the bench at Newcastle and was part of the senior setup during pre-season, while Norris was on the extended bench during the recent trip to Girona. All have been surrounded by the first team for some time and are no strangers to the senior squad, and we should also mention midfielder James McConnell (20) will also come into consideration. An interesting evening awaits and perhaps even more surprises. Confirmation of the team sheet is expected from 6.45pm (GMT). Speaking in his pre-match press conference on Tuesday, Slot said: “You talk about these two (Nallo and Norris) now, but there’s a few others who have made a good impact in training sessions. “I’m aware we’ve only got four defenders available, and probably the ones who have started a lot of times will not play 90 minutes, or maybe not even at all. “So it’s going to be either academy players who get playing time or players nobody would expect to see in the last line that are going to play in the last line [vs. Southampton].” Get our free app © Copyright This Is Anfield 2024'),

Elliott has featured for just 33 minutes under Arne Slot after he fractured his foot in training with England U21s in the season’s first international break. He watched 14 games from the sidelines and then a further two from the bench before marking his return with a late cameo against Man City, with further minutes against Girona (14) and Fulham (11). It has been a long process to get back on the pitch and Elliott has now explained that the coaching staff were right not to throw him back into the team “as quick as possible.” “I feel fit. I feel 100 percent, it’s just taking a bit of time. As it does after every injury,” Elliott told the club’s website before the trip to Southampton. “I wasn’t really quite there as much as I thought in my head that I was and the coaching staff and the manager could see that, and I think it was a mature decision to keep me part of it but not throw me in as quick as possible and I feel like it’s helped me now. “It’s built me up and I am hungrier than ever to get back out on the pitch and to help my team, to help the club, and I feel like now I am in a position where I feel 100 percent again and now I’m just raring to go.” It has been a frustrating start to the campaign for the 21-year-old, but he is eager not to allow that to dictate how he performs when given the opportunity by Slot. Asked if he’s desperate to make up for lost time, he said: “I wouldn’t say ‘desperate’ because I feel like that’s when you’ll start going off the rails a little bit. “I feel like it’s just for me to go out and just enjoy my football again. “I don’t want to put pressure on myself because last season and the seasons before when I was playing a fair amount I never did that, so for me to do that now because I’ve been out for a long time would be wrong. “I just want to go out, enjoy putting on the kit again, walking out and hopefully putting in a good performance. “We are there to win and that’s the priority really: it’s not about me, it’s about the team and however I can help I’m going to do so. “The most important thing, as I’ve said, is making sure we try to win.” Of Slot’s senior players, Elliott has played the fewest minutes but the relentless schedule ahead will certainly present the 21-year-old with chances to make an impact.
