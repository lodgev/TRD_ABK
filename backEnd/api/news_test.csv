Earlier this week, the Confederation of African Football approved their 2025 competition calendar and it includes another edition of the Africa Cup of Nations. It is supposed to be a summer tournament but it will take place in the winter yet again, with Morocco playing host from December 21, 2025 to January 18, 2026. For clubs in Europe who enjoy a winter break it will not be as disruptive, but Premier League sides will be in the middle of their busiest time of the year. To put it into some context, Liverpool play seven games in that exact timeframe this season – it could yet rise to eight if the Reds progress to the League Cup semi-final. Currently, Liverpool’s only concern would be losing Salah (yet again), but the No. 11 has yet to extend his contract at the club – though a formal offer has been tabled. It will be a bridge Slot and Co. will only cross if Salah does agree a new deal, but it serves as another reminder that the football calendar does not prioritise players or clubs. The 2025 AFCON falls in the same year as the introduction of FIFA’s new Club World Cup, which will take place over the summer and ask more of players plying their trade at the highest level. Earlier this year, the Press Association reported that clubs could block call-ups to either competition due to FIFA rules, but that could jeopardise relations with players. Last season Salah missed five games for Liverpool whilst at AFCON, he picked up an injury with Egypt and missed a subsequent seven matches, looking half the player he was before he left on return. It is one of many cautionary tales and could consequently make clubs think twice about pursuing African players in the upcoming transfer windows. The Reds have been linked to Egypt forward Omar Marmoush, though Eintracht Frankfurt insist there has been “no contact” over a possible transfer. Whether Salah signs a new contract or not, Liverpool will be expected to be without the winger for the festive schedule next season – but let’s hope that is all he will be absent for!

8650,7685C5964D4CDFC6DEB828B2799B4470,Liverpool’s squad vs. Southampton could include 4 players who’ve never started,https://www.thisisanfield.com/wp-content/uploads/Feature-image-template-1.jpg,2024-12-18T13:27:49.000Z,This is Anfield,https://www.thisisanfield.com/2024/12/liverpools-squad-vs-southampton-could-include-4-players-whove-never-started/,"This Is Anfield With suspension, injuries and a busy fixture list to consider, Arne Slot could turn to four players who have never started a game for Liverpool in the League Cup clash at Southampton. The Reds are a victory away from a semi-final berth on Wednesday evening, but Slot has already confirmed that “it’s going to be a game where not all our starters will start.” The Dutchman noted that a “few starters” will keep their place but we should expect rotation to the XI and a host of changes later in the game. With Andy Robertson (suspended), Kostas Tsimikas (ankle), Ibrahima Konate (knee) and Conor Bradley (hamstring) unavailable, opportunities are to open up for several young players. A potential quartet to do so have zero starts for Liverpool between them, but incredibly two of them have League Cup winners’ medals to their names already. Trey Nyoni (17), Amara Nallo (18), Jayden Danns (18) and James Norris (21) will all be considered to play a role – combined they have nine first-team appearances off the bench. Early team news from the Times‘ Paul Joyce suggests Nyoni is set to make his full debut at St Mary’s in a midfield that will likely include Alexis Mac Allister and Tyler Morton. The 17-year-old was part of the League Cup-winning squad last season and was used off the bench in the previous round of the competition by Slot, playing the final 26 minutes at Brighton. Danns, meanwhile, has only recently returned to academy action after a long-term back injury but will be under consideration, while centre-back Nallo and left-back Norris could have big roles to play. Nallo, an aggressive defender without any first-team outing, was on the bench at Newcastle and was part of the senior setup during pre-season, while Norris was on the extended bench during the recent trip to Girona. All have been surrounded by the first team for some time and are no strangers to the senior squad, and we should also mention midfielder James McConnell (20) will also come into consideration. An interesting evening awaits and perhaps even more surprises. Confirmation of the team sheet is expected from 6.45pm (GMT). Speaking in his pre-match press conference on Tuesday, Slot said: “You talk about these two (Nallo and Norris) now, but there’s a few others who have made a good impact in training sessions. “I’m aware we’ve only got four defenders available, and probably the ones who have started a lot of times will not play 90 minutes, or maybe not even at all. “So it’s going to be either academy players who get playing time or players nobody would expect to see in the last line that are going to play in the last line [vs. Southampton].” Get our free app © Copyright This Is Anfield 2024"
8650,53FE2508729F0C6BD375C2C3EFCB1B06,Harvey Elliott explains why coaching staff were right to delay his injury return,https://www.thisisanfield.com/wp-content/uploads/2024-12-01-253-Liverpool_Man_City.jpg,2024-12-18T11:30:49.000Z,This is Anfield,https://www.thisisanfield.com/2024/12/harvey-elliott-explains-why-coaching-staff-were-right-to-delay-his-injury-return/,"This Is Anfield It has been a season defined by injury so far for Harvey Elliott, and Liverpool’s staff made certain he was fully fit to return after 14 games on the sidelines. Elliott has featured for just 33 minutes under Arne Slot after he fractured his foot in training with England U21s in the season’s first international break. He watched 14 games from the sidelines and then a further two from the bench before marking his return with a late cameo against Man City, with further minutes against Girona (14) and Fulham (11). It has been a long process to get back on the pitch and Elliott has now explained that the coaching staff were right not to throw him back into the team “as quick as possible.” “I feel fit. I feel 100 percent, it’s just taking a bit of time. As it does after every injury,” Elliott told the club’s website before the trip to Southampton. “I wasn’t really quite there as much as I thought in my head that I was and the coaching staff and the manager could see that, and I think it was a mature decision to keep me part of it but not throw me in as quick as possible and I feel like it’s helped me now. “It’s built me up and I am hungrier than ever to get back out on the pitch and to help my team, to help the club, and I feel like now I am in a position where I feel 100 percent again and now I’m just raring to go.” It has been a frustrating start to the campaign for the 21-year-old, but he is eager not to allow that to dictate how he performs when given the opportunity by Slot. Asked if he’s desperate to make up for lost time, he said: “I wouldn’t say ‘desperate’ because I feel like that’s when you’ll start going off the rails a little bit. “I feel like it’s just for me to go out and just enjoy my football again. “I don’t want to put pressure on myself because last season and the seasons before when I was playing a fair amount I never did that, so for me to do that now because I’ve been out for a long time would be wrong. “I just want to go out, enjoy putting on the kit again, walking out and hopefully putting in a good performance. “We are there to win and that’s the priority really: it’s not about me, it’s about the team and however I can help I’m going to do so. “The most important thing, as I’ve said, is making sure we try to win.” Of Slot’s senior players, Elliott has played the fewest minutes but the relentless schedule ahead will certainly present the 21-year-old with chances to make an impact.

Shankly served Liverpool Football Club for 15 years between 1959 and 1974, taking the Reds out of the Second Division and propelling the club into contention on the European stage. The Scot embodied all that Liverpool and its supporters stand for, and now award-winning studio A24 are turning his story into a multi-episode TV series in association with Box to Box. Box to Box, the sports content studio, is behind the increasingly popular Netflix series ‘Formula 1: Drive to Survive’, while A24 is known for its originality and style that opposes major film studios. The series will be filmed in Liverpool and Anfield, supported by the club and Shankly’s granddaughter Karen Gill, who will help ensure historical accuracy in the retelling of this significant story. It will be set in the 1960s and explore a hugely pivotal era in the club’s history, charting Liverpool’s rise while also shining a light on the city and its unique local music scene. Shankly won the top-flight title three times, the FA Cup twice, and the UEFA Cup once, leaving an indelible legacy that is certainly worth immortalising further on television screens. He laid the foundations of success for the likes of Bob Paisley and Joe Fagan to immediately follow and for all of what came next as Liverpool established themselves as a global powerhouse. Jack Thorne, award-winning screenwriter and playwright, whose work includes ‘Harry Potter and the Cursed Child’ and ‘His Dark Materials’, is attached to write the series. On the project, Thorne said, via Variety: “I’m excited to be telling this incredible story and it’s an honour to be working alongside A24 and Liverpool Football Club. “Our goal is to focus not just on the club, but on the city itself—because, and this is one thing Bill Shankly made sure, the club belongs to the city and the city belongs to the club. “We have a chance with this show to celebrate both a magnificent football club and a magnificent city, whilst being honest about the struggles of the 1960s and 1970s in one of our industrial heartlands. “We hope to honour the fans, to the city, and the legacy of Liverpool FC in bringing its story to life.” There is currently no published timeline for the project, but the award-winning studios involved lend themselves to plenty of excitement for the finished product.

Mohamed Salah, Cole Palmer and Bukayo Saka are three stellar talents currently setting the top-flight of English football alight - but who is the best? Comparisons are made easy given the similar spaces off the right wing that each player occupies while in action, although determining which of the three takes top spot is no mean feat. Here, Sky Sports takes a statistical dive into each of the three players in a bid to make the decision easier for you, the reader. Saka has the lowest tally of goals and assists across the three but has found consistent form in an Arsenal side that has struggled in front of goal at times this season. Arsenal are the lowest scorers of the three teams with 28 goals in comparison to Chelsea's 37, which is the most in the division, and Liverpool's tally of 31. Despite this, Saka has registered a goal or assist in nine of his 15 outings in the Premier League, including the dominant performances against West Ham and Southampton. Live Premier League table Stream Sky Sports on NOW Premier League fixtures Premier League top scorers He continues to grow in importance by the day at the Emirates Stadium and it comes as no shock that he currently leads the league in assists with 10. It is an impressive figure which could be even better given no player has created more big chances than his 19 and his team-mate Kai Havertz currently sits in the top 10 for big chances missed with eight. Palmer's rise has been astronomic since swapping the Etihad Stadium for Stamford Bridge on Deadline Day last year and he has now solidified himself as one of best players in the league. Twenty-two goals and 11 assists was a staggering return in his first season at the club - and this form has carried over into the current campaign. With 11 goals and six assists already to his name, the 22-year-old is just behind Salah in terms of goal involvements in 2024/25. He is well-known for his unblemished record from the spot - scoring all 12 of his penalties so far - but his proficiency from 12 yards out has only supported his strong showings from open play. No player of the three has scored more from these situations in 2024 than Palmer and the creativity he offers Chelsea is highlighted by his team-mate, Nicolas Jackson, also being on the same figure. Given more freedom than his counterparts on the right wing, Palmer has the keys to this Chelsea side and it is clear to see why. In steps the most experienced of the three. Salah's talents in front of goal have been on full display in the Premier League since arriving in 2017 and his powers are not waning despite turning 32. He is currently tied with Erling Haaland in the race to secure his fourth golden boot in England with 13 goals already - not to mention the nine assists he has to go alongside them. The Egypt forward is currently averaging a goal involvement every 59 minutes, which is his best rate of return since completing the move to Anfield. This impressive form now makes it 13 goals from open play in the calendar year, with nine of these arriving since Arne Slot took charge at Liverpool this season. If Salah is here to stay, goals will inevitably follow. These Power Rankings are based on points awarded to players for 35 different statistics - from goals and assists, to blocks and tackles. Palmer currently takes top spot when taking into account Sky Sports' algorithm, followed closely by Salah in second and Saka in fourth.

8650,545C34159C51BCCCF0FAD7A4328ED0AF,Who will be on touchline for Liverpool at Southampton after Arne Slot ban?,https://www.thisisanfield.com/wp-content/uploads/2024-11-02-120-Liverpool_Brighton-1.jpg,2024-12-18T09:40:00.000Z,This is Anfield,https://www.thisisanfield.com/2024/12/who-will-be-on-touchline-for-liverpool-at-southampton-after-arne-slot-ban/,"This Is Anfield Arne Slot will serve his one-match touchline ban at Southampton, leaving his trusted assistants to take the reigns on the sidelines in his absence. Slot was shown his third yellow card of the season in the hectic draw against Fulham over the weekend, instantly triggering a touchline ban for Liverpool’s next domestic match. Although a different competition to which Slot was shown his cautions, he will watch from the stands at St Mary’s before returning to the touchline for the trip to Tottenham on Sunday. In Slot’s absence, his assistants Sipke Hulshoff and John Heitinga will oversee matters at ground level on Wednesday evening, with the former to take primary responsibilities. Hulshoff is a well-respected figure in football and first worked with Slot in 2015, with the assistant coach also acting as the No. 2 at Feyenoord. He is not one to seek the spotlight, but you may have noticed he is an active participant on the touchline on matchdays, he is in regular communication with Slot and the players. As for Heitinga, the former Everton defender was a late addition to the backroom staff this summer and had never previously worked with Slot, but has quickly made an impression. Speaking on his assistants ahead of their role at Southampton, Slot told reporters: “Sipke I worked with for a long time. We know each other in and out, especially football-wise. “One of the reasons why we work together [is] because we have so much in common. If it’s about the playing style, game model or the changes we make during the game. “And John Heitinga is now here with me for the first half [of the] season, and I couldn’t have wished for more. “If I say talented, I don’t even rate him high enough because he’s more than that already. He’s been a head coach himself, but he’s still young. “[He] grew into our staff from the start in a very good manner, so has the same idea about football. That’s also why I chose him to come to us as well. But the way he is with the boys, just like Sipke is, [is] very positive. “So yes, I will be involved [at Southampton]. But if I wouldn’t be, that would not be a problem at all for the players. They would not notice anything different.” Slot’s touchline ban is at odds with his typically calm and measured demeanour, but it is a nod to how refereeing decisions can trigger an emotional response. While a ban is far from ideal, Slot is at least thankful that he can still play a big role in preparing his team at St Mary’s. “If you are suspended in Holland, then you’re not allowed to be in and around the dressing room, you cannot do the media as well,” Slot explained. “This is a lighter version of suspension, I would say than I’m used to – but I’ve never been used to being suspended, it’s the first time I am. “I think I’m still able to do the things I want to do. The moment you have the least impact on your team is during the (two) 45 minutes, and the most impact you can have is at half-time or before the game. Those are the things I can do. “In an ideal situation, I would have just been on the sideline but I got a yellow, which I probably deserved, again, as well. It happens.” Southampton, meanwhile, have under-21s manager Simon Rusk in the dugout after Russell Martin was sacked in the immediate aftermath of the 5-0 defeat over the weekend.

Balagizi took in two loan spells last term, firstly with Wigan and then, after a mid-season recall, Kilmarnock, before heading back to Merseyside for pre-season. But having spent the summer with Liverpool U21s, the expectation had been that the 21-year-old would then depart either on loan or even on a permanent basis. A transfer never materialised, however, and he went on to score one and assist another in a 3-2 victory over Sunderland U21s in September. That proved to be his only appearance in the first four months of the campaign, with a hamstring injury keeping Balagizi sidelined until the start of this month. And with the U21s signing off for 2024 with a 3-3 draw at Crystal Palace on Monday, the versatile midfielder was able to come off the bench to cap his recovery from a lengthy issue. While a winter break for the academy offers him little time to build on that, Balagizi’s return to fitness could prove timely as the January transfer window looms. Having turned 21 in September, the chance of a first-team breakthrough at Liverpool may have passed him by, and he will be eager to make up for lost time at senior level. As clubs in the Football League and beyond assessing their options heading into January, Balagizi could now seek a new loan or perhaps a permanent transfer. He will not be the only Liverpool player finding himself in this position, with a senior core staying with the U21s for the first half of the season. That includes Tom Hill, 22 and Dominic Corness, 21, while Oakley Cannonier, Isaac Mabaya and Lee Jonas, all 20, have worked their way back from injuries of their own but find themselves needing exposure at first-team level. Similar could even be said of James Norris, the 21-year-old left-back, but injury to Kostas Tsimikas has led to him being called up to Arne Slot‘s squad this month. Liverpool’s pathways team will be monitoring potential destinations for those players in the upper age bracket of academy football, with a mid-season reshuffle likely to see younger talent promoted to the U21s. Balagizi’s return from injury may have come at the perfect time, then, with a player who shone on loan at Crawley in 2022 now needing an opportunity elsewhere.

The Reds have arrived on the south coast ahead of their third game of this season’s Carabao Cup defence, having already seen off Brighton and West Ham. Victory over manager-less Southampton will ensure a spot in the final four, with a two-legged semi-final – played in January and February – to await the winner. Slot will not be on the touchline on Wednesday night as he serves a one-match suspension and Liverpool will be without at least four players. Here is the latest on availability ahead of kickoff: While Robertson has joined the absentee list after being sent off against Fulham at the weekend, Liverpool are buoyed by the return of Alexis Mac Allister. Mac Allister has not featured in a fortnight having missed a game in each of the Premier League and Champions League due to back-to-back suspensions. Federico Chiesa could also make his first appearance since September, though Slot was unsure whether the summer signing is fit enough to start. “It’s definitely a moment where he can get minutes,” he said on Tuesday. “The amount of minutes is a question mark.” The same can be said of Diogo Jota, with the head coach revealing he was “not completely fit” after his goal off the bench against Fulham. Slot told reporters: “Let’s see if he can train with us today. Don’t expect him to start.” Slot knows he will be without Kostas Tsimikas, Ibrahima Konate and Conor Bradley due to long-term injuries. • READ: Tsimikas “close” to return as Arne Slot updates on 3 injuries But the Dutchman has confirmed Caoimhin Kelleher will start and strongly hinted that Wataru Endo will too, while academy defenders Amara Nallo and James Norris are being considered.

The Reds make the trip to Saints for a midweek quarter-final clash, with Arne Slot expected to ring the changes at St Mary’s. Jarell Quansah and Wataru Endo are both likely to start the game, but they will need to be careful of picking up a yellow card. If booked in this game, they will miss the first leg of the semi-final, should Liverpool proceed. Slot has confirmed that Caoimhin Kelleher will replace Alisson on Wednesday evening. The Irishman has saved more penalties in shootouts (6) than any other goalkeeper in Liverpool’s history, one more than Pepe Reina. Kelleher saved three spot-kicks in the 2022 win over Derby and has won four penalty shootouts with a 100 per cent winning record. Liverpool have been involved in 15 League Cup penalty shootouts, winning 11 of them, and they have won 20 of 27, in all competitions, including each of the last four. Liverpool have led in 20 of their 23 games played this season, and have won all 16 fixtures in which they have scored the game’s opening goal. The Reds have failed to score in only one of their last 27 matches – the 1-0 home defeat to Nottingham Forest back in September. Only one home team have prevented Liverpool from scoring since April 2023 – Everton in last April’s Merseyside derby. That means they have scored in 43 of their last 44 matches played away from Anfield. Liverpool are aiming to reach a 20th League Cup semi-final on Wednesday evening, which would be a record for the competition. Meanwhile, this is their 26th quarter-final in the tournament’s history. This is the eighth time Liverpool and Southampton have been drawn together in the League Cup, which includes the semi-finals in 1987 and 2017. In the 2017 semi, Virgil van Dijk started for Saints in the first leg. Southampton are the only team ever to beat Liverpool in both legs of a League Cup semi-final, preventing them from scoring in the process. They were also the first team ever to knock the Reds out of the competition, winning 2-1 at Anfield in November 1960. Saints have only won one of the last 15 meetings since winning 1-0 at Anfield in 2017, though.

Carabao Cup Quarter-Final | St Mary’s December 18, 2024 | 8pm (GMT) Arne Slot‘s side have stumbled a little in recent weeks, drawing back-to-back games in the Premier League. Carabao Cup commitments are up next for Liverpool, as they visit a beleaguered Southampton side. Here’s all you need to know ahead of the game. Southampton‘s 5-0 defeat to home to Tottenham on Sunday made for painful viewing – that was the score at half-time! – and it proved fatal for Russell Martin. There were deafening boos from the home crowd and the writing was on the wall for the Englishman, who was sacked after the game. Saints under-21s manager Simon Rusk will take Martin’s place in the dugout against Liverpool, taking temporary charge. Liverpool will also be without Slot in the dugout, with the Dutchman serving a one-match suspension after a third yellow card on Saturday against Fulham. Sipke Hulshoff will be in his spot. Liverpool should always be looking to win every competition, but there’s no ignoring the fact that Premier League commitments take precedence this season. Long domestic cup runs in recent years have seen the Reds run out of steam in the spring, so key players cannot afford to be overplayed. Those two final wins against Chelsea in 2021/22 were thrilling, but did Liverpool miss out on league glory because of the physical toll of both runs? This isn’t to say that Liverpool should be sacrificing the Carabao Cup, but there are bigger fish to fry in the coming months. Conor Bradley and Ibrahima Konate are the most noticeable longer-term absentees for Liverpool, with pair still not back in training. Diogo Jota should be in the squad but will not start, because he didn’t feel 100 percent fit after scoring in last weekend’s 2-2 draw at home to Fulham. Kostas Tsimikas has been stepping up his recovery from an ankle injury, however, and he is “close” to returning to the fold, says Slot. Andy Robertson is suspended after his red card at home to Fulham. As mentioned, we should expect to see a much-changed Liverpool XI on Wednesday evening. Amaro Nallo and James Norris could come into the team at centre-back and left-back, respectively, with Caoimhin Kelleher behind them in goal. Alexis Mac Allister is back after missing Liverpool’s last two games with European and domestic bans and should start alongside Wataru Endo and Tyler Morton. This could be a great time to give Federico Chiesa much-needed minutes, while Jayden Danns will hope to feature after his recent injury return. Predicted Liverpool XI: Kelleher; Alexander-Arnold, Quansah, Nallo, Norris; Endo, Morton, Mac Allister; Elliott, Diaz, Nunez Southampton are stuck between a rock and a hard place, with a response needed after their humiliation against Spurs, but players needing a rest. For that reason, it will be interesting to see how strong Rusk’s starting lineup is. Key man Aaron Ramsdale looks likely to return in goal, following an injury absence, but Jack Stephens is serving the last of a three-match ban. Martin picked a strong side in the last round at home to Stoke, with the likes of Taylor Harwood-Bellis, Mateus Fernandes and Adam Armstrong all starting. Speaking to the media on Tuesday, Slot explained his potential use of Chiesa: “It’s definitely a moment where he can get minutes. The amount of minutes is a question mark “You cannot expect for him to play 90, I think, especially not at this level where the intensity is so high, because he’s been out for five, six months now. “But he will, if he has a good training session, make minutes.” Liverpool know that victory over Saints will make it five wins in a row at St Mary’s in front of supporters. The Reds lost 1-0 there back in January 2021, but did football behind closed doors really even count?! The highlights from the last time we faced Southampton at St Mary's in the quarter-finals of the @Carabao_Cup ??? pic.twitter.com/kQ9PrCKzUf — Liverpool FC (@LFC) December 16, 2024 The last time Liverpool were beaten at St Mary’s in a ‘proper’ game was in January 2017, when Nathan Redmond’s goal earned the hosts a 1-0 win in the Carabao Cup semi-final first leg. Meanwhile, the Reds won 6-1 at St Mary’s in this competition in December 2015, even though Sadio Mane opened the scoring for Saints. Liverpool are aiming to reach a 20th League Cup semi-final on Wednesday, which would be a record in the competition. This is the Reds’ 26th quarter-final in the tournament’s history, too. Meanwhile, this is the eighth time that Liverpool and Southampton have been drawn together in the League Cup, which includes the semi-finals in 1987 and 2017. Virgil van Dijk started for Saints in the first leg of the latter. Simon Hooper will take charge of Wednesday’s game. He was the referee for last season’s heartbreaking 2-1 defeat at Tottenham when Curtis Jones was harshly sent off and Luis Diaz saw a goal wrong disallowed. Hooper’s only Liverpool game so far this term was the 1-0 win away to Crystal Palace back in October. His assistants at St Mary’s will be Adrian Holmes and Simon Long, while Josh Smith is the fourth official.

Liverpool supporters are looking for anything positive regarding Salah’s future, and an unlikely source claims a new contract is already wrapped up. In quotes reported by the Liverpool Echo, former Man City striker – and Liverpool fan – Aguero claimed the Reds legend has agreed to a two-year extension at Anfield. “As I understand, Salah’s renewed his contract with Liverpool for two more seasons,” Aguero said. “I think this should clear all doubts about his future. He remains a key player and a fresh contract is the best news Liverpool could receive.” If true – if! – Liverpool now know they will be without Salah over Christmas next year, with the dates for the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations confirmed. The tournament will take place from Sunday, December 21, 2025 to Sunday, January 18, 2026.

Wide-man Lamine, for his part, was on Monday of course condemned to a fresh spell on the sidelines. After a round of medical tests in Catalunya’s capital, the 17-year-old was diagnosed with a sprained ankle, which is expected to keep him away from the pitch for a period of three to four weeks. Lamine suffered the injury during a La Liga meeting with Leganés on Sunday. The Spanish international has in turn been ruled out of Barcelona’s upcoming La Liga meeting with Atlético Madrid, as well as the club’s Copa del Rey clash against Barbastro on January 4th. From here, though, the hope is that Lamine will be available to play his part four days later, against Athletic Club. Hansi Flick’s troops will kick their Spanish Super Cup campaign into gear on the 8th of January, in a meeting with Ernesto Valverde’s Athletic. And, according to Mundo Deportivo, a personalised treatment programme – featuring platelet-rich plasma injections and a protective boot – has already begun, with a view to Lamine playing his part in Saudi Arabia.

So much so that, over the course of the year to date, he has appeared in a total of 69 official matches across all competitions. This is more than any other player in the professional game, ahead of Fluminense’s Jhon Arias (67), and Real Madrid midfielder Federico Valverde (66). Koundé also leads the way when it comes to minutes played in 2024, with a tally of 5,872. Expected to feature from the off once more in Barcelona’s final fixture of the year against Atlético Madrid this weekend, the former Sevilla man, in turn, will become the only player in football to play 70 official games in 2024.

Kounde tops the charts ahead of Fluminense’s Jhon Arias (on a mere 5,599 minutes) and Real Madrid’s Fede Valverde who has mustered just 5,573 minutes. It’s an extraordinary set of stats and made even more interesting when you realise that Kounde has admitted he goes in for extra training sessions. Barcelona manager Hansi Flick has also admitted it’s hard to get Kounde to rest, although he has taken him out of his XI on several occasions for disciplinary reasons. Kounde’s record is certainly impressive but will raise concerns about fatigue and fitness, particularly at Barca after seeing how Pedri struggled after a mega year for club and country.

Barcelona have reportedly been handed a boost after fresh tests on Lamine Yamal’s ankle injury suffered against Leganes. There have been concerns raised that the injury may be more severe than first thought, but Barcelona are optimistic that it is just a simple sprain. Diario AS are reporting that tests revealed that the injury has not affected the external lateral ligament of the ankle and Yamal “only has a part of the membrane that covers the fibula and tibia affected.” The upshot is that this makes “rehabilitation work and the time off much easier” and Yamal will hopefully return as originally scheduled. Barca said in an initial statement that he would miss the next “3-4 weeks” and there is now “high optimism” he will be fit to face Athletic Cup in the Spanish Super Cup. Yamal has also sounded positive about his latest injury setback and told fans he will be “back soon” after picking up the Golden Boy award. Check your inbox for a welcome email. Oops.

Lamine Yamal in The Best FIFA Men's 11 - FC BarcelonaFans and a group of expert pundits have decided that Lamine Yamal is one of the players in The Best FIFA Men's 11 that will be presented at The Best awards organised by FIFA.

Barcelona not considering to conduct any business during winter transfer window - Football EspañaBarcelona made an outstanding start to the 2024-25 season, although they have fallen off significantly in recent weeks. The upcoming winter break will allow Hansi Flick’s side to reset, and business could also be done during the transfer window, which opens at the start of January. Barcelona take steps to ensure best possible recovery for Gavi after ACL injury - Football EspañaGavi is still a long way away from being back at 100% match sharpness, which is why Barcelona head coach Hansi Flick has only afforded him two starts (vs Celta Vigo and Las Palmas). He is also yet to complete a full 90 minutes, and it would be no surprise if that did not happen for a long time. Barcelona set deadline for contract talks with Frenkie de Jong and Ronald Araujo - Football EspañaBarcelona have a number of star players out of contract in 2026, and Sporting Director Deco has the unenviable task of locking them down for the future. While there have been plenty of positive noises about the renewals of Gavi and Pedri, that has not been the case for Ronald Araujo and Frenkie de Jong. Barcelona to go to court with La Liga over Dani Olmo registration - Football EspañaAs things stand, this weekend’s match between Barcelona and Atletico Madrid will be Dani Olmo’s last in La Liga this season. His registration, which was only allowed to happen during the summer as 80% of Andreas Christensen’s salary was used because of his long-term injury, only lasts until the 31st of December.

Yamal’s injury does not appear too severe, but the youngster will still miss a key game against Atletico Madrid, as well as a Copa del Rey tie and a Supercopa game against Athletic Club most likely. Yet concerns have been raised already that it’s not a “typical” injury and may be more worrying than it appears. Barca claimed Yamal “decided” he was OK to continue against Leganes, but should an inexperienced 17-year-old (who is obviously desperate to play every minute) really be making that call? It only takes a couple of seconds to recall the variety of muscle injuries that plagued Pedri since coming on the scene in 2021, as well as those of Ansu Fati since bursting on the stage (and we can even throw in Dembele and De Jong here). Young players, especially at a club the size of Barcelona, will always tend to ignore the pain and play on, especially when there are veterans and other youngsters in the squad vying for a starting position. But, given the number of fixtures each year, especially with added Champions League matches and international commitments, the onus must be in more in the club’s hands instead of the players. While all games carry a critical importance, especially when vying for multiple trophies, Barca must do a better job of ensuring the long-term success for all players throughout the squad, but especially youngsters. The cost/benefit of having a player miss just one game to properly recover and rest, vastly outweighs the weeks and/or months on the sideline that could follow. With the abundance of matches on the club and international fixture lists, clubs like Barcelona must be progressive in protecting their players or face the risk of stunting the growth of generational talents for short-term results.

The left-back has made 13 appearances in all competitions this season and is clearly happy with how things are going in Glasgown. “Both I and the team in general are in very good dynamics. I am very happy and I think the team is spectacular. It is a great prize to end the year,” he told Cadena SER. Valle is due back at Barcelona at the end of the season and may have a chance to make the first-team squad as the team are short on options at left-back. The defender was asked about the future but was pretty coy about what might happen next. “Barça has always been my home. This would be my eleventh season, so I have a special affection for it. In the end, these are circumstances in football and everyone does what they can,” he added. “I am very grateful for everything that has happened to me and is happening to me in life. I continue with the present and enjoy it, whatever happens next will be what has to happen. I consider that I have improved and I will improve in other aspects.” Barcelona have been linked with dipping into the transfer market to sign a new left-back but will certainly be keeping tabs on Valle to see how he progresses at Celtic.

This comes amid fresh rumours linking the winger with a move to Spain, with Barcelona. The name of attacker Díaz of course took its place front and centre in the headlines in Catalunya’s capital throughout this past summer’s transfer window. As much comes after the 27-year-old was identified as a leading target on the part of Deco and co, amid Barcelona’s search for reinforcements on the left flank. In the end, no such transfer was forthcoming, with Díaz having since gone on to play a leading role under the watch of new Liverpool boss Arne Slot. As alluded to above, though, if the latest word doing the rounds in the media on Tuesday is anything to go by, then a Camp Nou switch for the South American could well be on the cards in 2025. As per a report from Diario Sport, citing ‘Antena2’ in Díaz’s home country of Colombia, negotiations to extend Díaz’s Liverpool contract have reached an impasse. This comes amid the understanding that the former Porto man is angling for a move to none other than Barcelona: ‘The footballer would be about to make a change of scenery with his clear priority playing for Barça,’ it is reported.

In the first few months, Flick’s Barcelona won almost every game in La Liga and delivered decisive victories against some of their toughest rivals like Real Madrid and Bayern Munich. What has since happened is hard to explain. One win in six in La Liga, including three losses and two draws. It was one thing to lose to Real Sociedad (7th) with a wrongly disallowed goal, but it’s quite another to lose to UD Las Palmas (14th) and CD Leganés (15th.) There have been good wins in that period, notably away against Borussia Dortmund in the UEFA Champions League. But overall, the results are quite bad. A recent form table over this period showed Barcelona last in La Liga - truly baffling after such a great start. Barcelona dominated the chances against Leganés but couldn’t convert any, with particularly, Robert Lewandowski - who was scoring like a machine previously - missing what should’ve been easy chances. It was a similar story against Las Palmas, Barcelona created more than enough to win but could not convert. Another key weakness has been conceding late goals. Against Real Betis, Barcelona allowed Assane Diao to score an equalizer in the 94th when they looked to have won the match. And against Celta de Vigo, it was even worse: allowing two goals after the 84th minute to let the home team avoid defeat. The only reason Barcelona are even still in the title race has been the faltering form of Real Madrid, who have not capitalized fully on Barça’s slips. But unless Barcelona’s form changes, they will probably see themselves leapfrogged by either Real or Atlético de Madrid soon. Speaking of Atlético, Barcelona’s next match is against them in what could be a pivotal clash in the title race. The Catalans will be without Lamine Yamal, and forced to come up against a very good team to try to get a result. Thankfully, Flick has the winter break to try to reset his team and get them back to winning ways. The worry is that the damage may have been already done by the time we get there.

That’s according to Diario Sport, who point towards Òscar Gistau as the player in question. Gistau, for those not familiar with his name, is a 16-year-old centre-forward who has long been making a name for himself as a potential star in the making. Despite his tender years, Gistau is already a regular with Barca Atlètic, the Spaniard’s goalscoring exploits having sparked widespread excitement behind the scenes in Catalunya’s capital. Safe to say, then, that it will mark a blow for all associated with Barcelona to learn of Gistau’s development, for the time being, coming to a halt. As revealed by Sport, the young frontman this week underwent surgery in Finland. As much came in an effort to definitively resolve a long-standing right hamstring issue.

Three weeks ago, Dowman joined a group of academy players in first-team training, including Jack Henry-Francis, Jimi Gower, Josh Robinson, Ayden Heaven, Tommy Setford, Alexei Rojas, and Lucas Nygaard. While Henry-Francis recently returned from a loan spell at Sligo Rovers, Dowman’s inclusion reflects a clear intention from Arsenal to prioritise his development and ward off interest from other Premier League academies. Dowman’s age has excluded him from competitions like the FA Youth Cup, but these restrictions have created opportunities for him to train with senior players instead. His performances have clearly made an impression, with Mikel Arteta continuing to bring him into the first-team environment as a sign of the club’s commitment to his future amid reports his family were not happy when Jack Wilshere left for Norwich. This season, Dowman has already made his debut for the U21s and recorded three goals and two assists for the U18s. He has also appeared in the UEFA Youth League with the U19s and represents England at U17 level. Arsenal are taking decisive steps to show Dowman that his future lies at the club, with reports suggesting Arteta may even include him on a first-team bench this season in the Premier League to emphasise the pathway to senior football."

The club last won the League Cup in 1993, and Arteta is determined to end the drought this season, seeing it as a stepping stone to future triumphs. “I fully believe in that: the fact that you are winning and you get into the next round and it creates something different around the team, and that is why these kind of games are so important,” Arteta said. “It is really helpful. It brings belief, trust, positive energy, touching the cup, and being in the semi-final and beating somebody in the final; it is that energy and it creates the right path to go and do something else, particularly because of the timing and when the competition is played in this country, it gets that momentum going.” Despite a defensive crisis, with Myles Lewis-Skelly likely to deputise at left-back in the absence of Riccardo Calafiori and Oleksandr Zinchenko, Arteta is expected to field a strong team. Gabriel Jesus could start despite scoring only once this season, with Arteta expressing confidence that the forward will regain form. “I don’t know if it’s confidence but obviously he’s got that will that the ball goes in the back of the net and he will start to have some momentum,” Arteta said. “When he plays in that position he needs to deliver in those moments and he’s really trying.”"

Mohamed Salah, Cole Palmer and Bukayo Saka are three stellar talents currently setting the top-flight of English football alight - but who is the best? Comparisons are made easy given the similar spaces off the right wing that each player occupies while in action, although determining which of the three takes top spot is no mean feat. Here, Sky Sports takes a statistical dive into each of the three players in a bid to make the decision easier for you, the reader. Saka has the lowest tally of goals and assists across the three but has found consistent form in an Arsenal side that has struggled in front of goal at times this season. Arsenal are the lowest scorers of the three teams with 28 goals in comparison to Chelsea's 37, which is the most in the division, and Liverpool's tally of 31. Despite this, Saka has registered a goal or assist in nine of his 15 outings in the Premier League, including the dominant performances against West Ham and Southampton. Live Premier League table Stream Sky Sports on NOW Premier League fixtures Premier League top scorers He continues to grow in importance by the day at the Emirates Stadium and it comes as no shock that he currently leads the league in assists with 10. It is an impressive figure which could be even better given no player has created more big chances than his 19 and his team-mate Kai Havertz currently sits in the top 10 for big chances missed with eight. Palmer's rise has been astronomic since swapping the Etihad Stadium for Stamford Bridge on Deadline Day last year and he has now solidified himself as one of best players in the league. Twenty-two goals and 11 assists was a staggering return in his first season at the club - and this form has carried over into the current campaign. With 11 goals and six assists already to his name, the 22-year-old is just behind Salah in terms of goal involvements in 2024/25. He is well-known for his unblemished record from the spot - scoring all 12 of his penalties so far - but his proficiency from 12 yards out has only supported his strong showings from open play. No player of the three has scored more from these situations in 2024 than Palmer and the creativity he offers Chelsea is highlighted by his team-mate, Nicolas Jackson, also being on the same figure. Given more freedom than his counterparts on the right wing, Palmer has the keys to this Chelsea side and it is clear to see why. In steps the most experienced of the three. Salah's talents in front of goal have been on full display in the Premier League since arriving in 2017 and his powers are not waning despite turning 32. He is currently tied with Erling Haaland in the race to secure his fourth golden boot in England with 13 goals already - not to mention the nine assists he has to go alongside them. The Egypt forward is currently averaging a goal involvement every 59 minutes, which is his best rate of return since completing the move to Anfield. This impressive form now makes it 13 goals from open play in the calendar year, with nine of these arriving since Arne Slot took charge at Liverpool this season. If Salah is here to stay, goals will inevitably follow. These Power Rankings are based on points awarded to players for 35 different statistics - from goals and assists, to blocks and tackles. Palmer currently takes top spot when taking into account Sky Sports' algorithm, followed closely by Salah in second and Saka in fourth.

Here’s what he had to say… On what his team’s in-depth analysis of Arsenal’s matches shows him so far… The sample is smaller, but comparing games, for example, what we did against Everton at home and how we played away against them [last season] and how we did today, we’re much better. Against Fulham, [compared to last season] 10 times better. Against many opposition, much better. The thing is that you need the reward of winning that game and that’s disappointing. In the last six, we won four and drew two. We deserve to win all of them by a mile. And we are not happy because we want to win the six of them because we deserve to win them. On how deep his team’s analysis goes I think there is always a lot of noise after a game and a red card. And then probably a few days later, you can analyse the game and say, “Yeah, but you guys played with ten men.” But two months later, when you put all the data together, nobody talks about that. And when you play 45 minutes without a player or two players or three players or seven defenders out, nobody recalls that. We have to because we need to understand a different perspective of the team. On whether there was always a chance of a dip in form given the strain of the last two seasons… The chance, if you are not top, to be somewhere down is really high. I wouldn’t say small. The probability is the highest, probably. Because being at the top in this league is the highest thing, the most difficult thing. So after that, everything is going to be behind it. We want to be first, we want to be the best and that’s how it works. On needing a step back before going forward again… In relation to points or winning, it’s very difficult to predict. Performance is something else and that’s what we put the emphasis on. At the end, doing everything that we can to end the right to win games and have the highest probability. After winning or not is a consequence of many factors. On whether he’s heard about the rebranded European Super League proposals… Today? Yeah. No, sorry. On many of his squad not yet winning a trophy and the effect it can have… It gives you trust, belief. The fact that you’ve done it, I think it’s contagious for the rest and it has to be a first time that you do it. And as well, difficult to replicate when you haven’t done it and you have the hunger to do it. That’s a really positive thing as well. So we have to look at it from that perspective. On how important it is for Gabriel Jesus to break his scoring drought… I’m very looking forward to that because he does everything in the best possible way. His application, his energy, how he tries, how he wants it and he just needs to be rewarded. Hopefully, it’s going to be very soon. On whether Jesus is suffering from a crisis of confidence… I don’t know if it’s confidence, but obviously, he’s got that will, that the ball goes in the back of the neck and he starts to have some momentum in relation to that. At the end he plays in positions where he needs to deliver those moments and he’s really trying. On suggesting Ethan Nwaneri could play as a number 9 and whether that’s already an option… No, it’s the possibility of it and I don’t see it now. You’re asking me about ways of playing together, can we play in different formations as well? So that’s it, nothing that’s going to happen now. Δ Δ I’m the biggest cheerleader of Gabby Jesus (as you can see in my profile name) and praying for him to break that duck becauseI think he’s a good man and totally deserves it. Fingers crossed he bangs in a couple this evening, which then triggers a prolific run and shuts his haters’ mouths for good! The same is said about GJ everytime but alas… I don’t think criticism of a player is hating them. He hasn’t been very good for Arsenal and was just OK for City. There is no harm in admitting that fact. When we bought Jesus and Zinchenko from City, it felt like the right move to push us in the competitive direction. However, if we want to push further, we need better starters and backups. Jesus and Zinchenko are not those. If they were, City would have kept them.. Guardiola started putting Aguero on the bench thinking that Gab “nobody plays the pressing game better” Jesus could replace him. After five games, he had to change his mind and bring back reliable Aguero. Arteta had to use Eddie and Havertz. There were never a prolific run. That’s the problem. We need a trophy(s) to keep players like Saliba long term. We’ve been very unlucky with injuries the last few seasons. Here’s hoping… first time in 14 years all teams in the EFL cup quarter finals are from premier league, sign of changing times, the competition is strong in EPL and the EFL cup it’s a trophy worth winning and we should make sure of a win. we have at least to more trophies to point, CL and FA and we must targtet them. let’s look where we are in the leage after we meet citeh on first feb Chelsea has had Reece James, Nkunku and Fofana almost in Tierney’s world in recent seasons."

She has filled in at centre-half during different periods. But this season is different. This season she is being selected by Interim Manager Renee Slegers ahead of Lotte Wubben-Moy and Laia Codina. The fact that Catley is left-footed, a rare commodity in women’s football and the fact that left-back Katie McCabe is asked to push up as a wing-back or invert into midfield makes Catley’s qualities well-suited to the role. In the pre-Bayern press conference, Catley admitted the positional change does feel quite different. ‘I’ve done it a fair bit in my career when I’ve changed from left-back to centre-back and physically you definitely feel the difference in terms of high-speed metres and the amount of ground you’re covering,’ she explained. ‘But mentally, I think it’s a whole different game. At full-back, the options you’re given are quite limited a lot of the time, so it’s all instinctive, whereas, at centre-back, it’s all about organising, staying connected to everyone and reading the game before everything happens, that’s the challenge. ‘Physically, it’s less load for me so in a way I feel fresher going into games and recover quicker, so that’s always a nice thing, but ultimately for me, it’s just whatever role the team needs me to play – I’m ready for any of it. I’m playing full-back frequently for the national team, played wingback, and centre-back, whatever the team needs I’m prepared for it both physically and mentally.’ The Gunners have conceded just two goals in eight games now and Catley says that is a result of an overall team mentality. ‘I think it’s down to consistency, but I think, as a whole, our entire squad appreciates the value of a clean sheet, knows how important it is and it’s something we really drive in our standards, when we’re training, when we go out to every game it’s something we remind ourselves of. ‘It’s not only just about the players that are on the field at the moment, I think when you see players coming off the bench, Lotte the other day, coming in, making it a five [at the back], everyone knows their role, everyone knows the standards, the specifics to get a result and make sure we get that clean sheet. ‘I think consistency is one of those things but just knowing your role and knowing how important every aspect of the defending is, even from the front, the way that we press, a clean sheet isn’t just down to the back four or the defenders, it’s from the front, it’s from the strikers that are starting the press so, it’s something that’s going well for us but we’ve got to continue to make that happen.’ The Australian also says the faith Slegers has put in her as a centre-half has made a difference. ‘She’s come in under really difficult circumstances and really steadied the ship. She’s given a lot of individual players a lot of confidence to play how they want to play and to go out and do their thing. ‘And [she’s given] the group as well, a lot of confidence. She brings a lot of positive energy and is a really good communicator. That’s just been really effective way to manage the group. I think you can see that in the results.’ Δ Δ We have so many players who look comfortable in more than one position. Steph is a prime example. Our defensive options are incredible. Fullbacks- Emily, Laura, Katie’s M & R, Steph Centrebacks-Leah, Lia, Lotte, Liai, Steph, Mandy, Katie R. I’m already nervous about this game, Tim, there’s no way to comment on the other post as it’s blocked, I’ll comment here, the formation is very good, I hope to see Mariona in her original position, KCC and Kim bringing physicality to the midfield will be needed. A lot of the recent threads have been blocked. I’m getting withdrawal symptoms! 🙂 That’s right,😄"

It’s now again 😉 We’re in Carabao Cup quarter-final action this evening, hosting Crystal Palace for a place in the semi-finals. There’s not much in the way of team news, other than confirmation we’ll remain without Riccardo Calafiori and Oleksandr Zinchenko, while a decision will be made about Declan Rice’s fitness before kick-off. At this stage of the competition, I think there will still be changes to the side, but I expect those to be more further forward than at the back where options are limited. We know the right-back situation, and the only realistic way of resting William Saliba is to play Jurrien Timber at centre-half, so that’s a complication. Jakub Kiwior could come in, and this was surely a game Myles Lewis-Skelly had earmarked for a start – but the injury situation means he’s been needed from the off in the last two games too. Could Kieran Tierney even come into the equation? In midfield, we could see Jorginho, and much like his young teammate, Ethan Nwaneri will be looking to get a chance in this one. His last two cameos from the bench haven’t been as impactful as he (and we) might have liked, but he tends to be more effective when he starts. In the front three, if we can’t play Raheem Sterling in this one, when can we play him at all? I think he’ll come in for Saka on the right, it’ll likely be Leandro Trossard on the left, with Gabriel Jesus up front. That is a lot of experience, but it’s low on output of late. Trossard has 4 goals and 2 assists from 22 appearances this season; Sterling has a goal and 2 assists in 10 mostly fleeting appearances, and his only strike in an Arsenal shirt came in this competition against lower league opposition; while Jesus’s only goal in his last 34 games came in the last round against Preston. On the Brazilian, Arteta made it clear that while he has no problems with how he’s working, he has to produce in front of goal: I don’t know if it’s confidence, but obviously he’s got that will that the ball goes in the back of the net and he starts to have some momentum in relation to that. Because at the end he plays in positions where he needs to deliver those moments, and he’s really trying. Tonight would be a very good night to find his shooting boots again. For all the analysis and discussion and tactical chat about why we aren’t hitting the back of the net as often as we’d like, having a bunch of players who don’t score goals consistently is – for me anyway – ultimately the main reason. Until such time as we can do something about that, whether it’s January or beyond, it’s the manager’s job to get more out of these guys. And I wish him the very best of luck with that. As for Palace, they’ve found some form after an iffy start to the season, and come into this one on the back of a good Premier League win against Brighton. We know where they’re dangerous, and in a cup-tie situation, you’d hope this is a more open game of football than the last couple we’ve played. Hopefully we deal with their threat, and use the space to create danger of our own. As for this competition, I don’t think there’s any way we should be snobby about it. Is it the least important of the four? Obviously yes. Do we want to win the Premier League or Champions League more? Again, that’s obvious. But it doesn’t mean we shouldn’t be trying to win this one too. We’ve built a really good team over the last few years, but we also need silverware. The title challenges were great, but the players want medals and the fans want trophies. This competition is one we should take seriously, especially given how close you are to a final if you win tonight, so fingers crossed. Right, I’m gonna leave it there for now. Join us later for live blog coverage, plus you’ll get the match report, goal clips, reaction, player ratings and much more over on Arseblog News. Until then."

Saka narrowly edges out Jamal Musiala (7.81) and Cole Palmer (7.78), with Harry Kane, Lamine Yamal, Omar Marmoush, Florian Wirtz, Jude Bellingham, Vinicius Junior, and Raphinha completing the top 10. Introducing: #WhoScoredWrapped! 🎁Starting with the highest rated players in Europe's top five leagues…2024 has been Bukayo Saka's year. 🌶️ pic.twitter.com/g2AQ0Xih8C Despite not making the top-10, there’s obviously a strong argument that Mohamed Salah should be considered the Premier League’s Player of the Season so far, with 22 goals and assists in 15 games in the league alone. Yet the first half of Salah’s 2024 was less impressive. He did rack up nine goal contributions in 13 games, but he missed a number of other games through injury. Plus, five of those nine goals and assists were in his first two games of the year. After that, he went on a bit of a drought by his standards. Saka has been more consistent throughout 2024, even if Salah’s level is arguably higher in this season alone. We can only hope the two players start 2025 the same way they both started 2024. If that happens, Arsenal would have a genuine chance at catching Liverpool before the season’s end."

A draw and Bayern will take first place with Arsenal in second. Following the Gunners’ chastening 5-2 defeat in Munich on match day one in October, they would absolutely have signed up for this scenario on that evening. That proved to be the penultimate game of Jonas Eidevall’s reign as Arsenal’s confidence had sagged and at that point, it looked impossible for Arsenal to be in this position come match day six. Part of that is because Munich slipped up in Oslo in November, being held to a 1-1 draw thanks to a stoppage time Valarenga equaliser. Otherwise, the Gunners would have needed to overturn the three goal deficit they suffered in Germany to have a chance of topping the group. This also represents the final game of 2024 before the team goes on their winter break until the New Year. If Arsenal win this game, it will represent a very close to perfect return under Renee Slegers’ interim charge. If she manages that, it is difficult to envisage her not being offered the top job. But first and foremost, Arsenal will want a big win after a run of relatively winnable games and to top the group and finish a topsy turvy year on a high. It won’t be easy but a small but rambunctuous Meadow Park crowd might be an important marginal factor. TEAM NEWS Kim Little is fit to play after coming through her 33 minute sub appearance at Liverpool on Sunday, Lia Walti is out as she is still recovering from surgery for an abscess. Victoria Pelova (knee) and Amanda Ilestedt (returning from maternity leave) are out.

It’s a very intimate place to be. So I think we get that extra connection. We’re very close to each other. So that’s positive for tomorrow from a facilities perspective. ‘Obviously, the Emirates has all the space. There’s room for everything, there’s technology, and that’s different than Boreham Wood, but we’ve been doing that for such a long time, and we have a good process in place for tomorrow as well. ‘Pernille Harder is part of their threats, as a team they have certain threats as well – we’ve discussed most of it, we feel comfortable with understanding who Bayern is, what they do, what they have done previously, what they did against us in the away leg, but obviously they can come out and do something different, so we have to be on our toes. I think we feel prepared as a team.’ LAST TIME OUT When the teams met on match day one, Arsenal were beaten 5-2. They took the lead through Mariona before Viggisdottir’s equaliser. Sydney Lohmann gave Bayern a second half lead before Laia Codina’s equaliser. But a hat trick in the final 20 minutes from Pernille Harder meant Bayern were 5-2 winners. The last time the teams met in North London was in March 2023 in the quarter-finals, the Gunners overturned a 1-0 first leg deficit with a 2-0 win thanks to goals from Frida Maanum and Stina Blackstenius. THE OPPOSITION Bayern’s slip up on match day four in Oslo has presented Arsenal with the opportunity to leapfrog them and it has been a tight and interesting season for Bayern. In truth, Arsenal outplayed them for the first 30 minutes in Munich but as soon as Bayern equalised, Arsenal heads dropped. Munich eventually won the game on setpieces (perish the thought…) Closer to home, Bayern are embroiled in one of the most exciting title races across Europe. They trail Eintracht Frankfurt at the top of the league on goal difference, with Wolfsburg just one point further back and Bayer Leverkusen a point back still. What is beyond doubt is Bayern’s quality, with players like Georgia Stanway, Giulia Gwinn inverting from right back, Sarah Zadrazil, Pernille Harder and Klara Buhl, they have a lot of individual quality, as they showed on match day one. They scored five goals without really dominating the game. They will provide a stern examination for Arsenal again. PLAYER TO WATCH As I pointed out in my analysis piece for the Liverpool game earlier this week, Arsenal have really missed their long established midfield double pivot of Kim Little and Lia Walti in the last two WSL games, especially in Sunday’s win at Liverpool. The game became a little too transitional with Mariona joining Kyra Cooney-Cross in the midfield double pivot. Essentially, Arsenal have been saving Kim Little for this game. The Scot probably could have played in Valarenga or against Villa and certainly could have started the Liverpool game. But with Walti missing, Renee Slegers knew that Kim Little needed protecting at all costs. Coming into this game without both midfield controllers would make for a tough assignment. Bayern are incredibly strong in the midfield even with Lena Oberdorf injured. Stanway and Zigiotti are an excellent midfield pivot with Giulia Gwinn tucking in and joining them from right-back. How Arsenal control that area will be key and Slegers knows this well, clearly she felt Arsenal could manage their way through the previous three games because she didn’t want to leave this one to chance. PREDICTED LINE UPS Subs: 1.Zinsberger 3.Wubben-Moy 5.L.Codina 9.Mead 16.Kafaji 17.Hurtig 22.Kuhl 25.Blackstenius 26.Wienroither 40.Williams 56.Godfrey 62.Reid HOW TO CATCH THE GAME The game kicks off at 8pm on Wednesday evening at Meadow Park and will be streamed live on DAZN’s YouTube channel. The match will also be shown live on TNT Sports in the UK. COMING UP We will have the usual on the whistle match report from Aidan Gibson, as well as every word from Renee Slegers’ post-match press conference shortly after the final whistle. Jamie and I will have a half-season review podcast next week too covering the season so far, as well as hopes for the January transfer window. We also have another podcast planned for you during the winter break."

Conceding three times to Liverpool, five times to Chelsea, and another five times to Tottenham Hotspur, Southampton have been in dire form, to the extent that they sacked their manager at the weekend. Interim boss Simon Rusk will have his fingers crossed that Ramsdale’s return can help a bit with their defensive issues. “The finger is getting more bendy, it’s getting there,” Ramsdale said ahead of the Liverpool game. “It was too soon for [the Spurs] game. We have two games that I’m hoping to be involved in. “We’ve got a big game and one we can try to get into the semi-final of the cup on Wednesday.” Facing a Liverpool side flying high in the Premier League, Champions League, and the League Cup isn’t going to be easy for a Southampton side right at the other end of the table. One small positive is that the Saints are at home to Liverpool, and they’ll hope their fans and the change in manager can give the team a bit of a lift. Ramsdale’s return should help too, though even he only kept one clean sheet in his first 10 appearances following his move from Arsenal. It hasn’t been a good season for his new side, and they need a spark to turn things around."

Previously, VAR had been in use for all matches at Wembley Stadium and at any Premier League grounds, but not for games at lower-league grounds. The justification for that decision was the costs, infrastructure, and workforce required to have video officials for all of those games. But to ensure consistency for all teams in the competition, the change has been made to remove VAR for the third and fourth rounds, even at Premier League grounds, before bringing it in for the fifth round onwards, even at the lower-league grounds. As a result, despite Arsenal’s third-round match being against a big-six side in Manchester United, and despite the fact it will be played at the Emirates Stadium, there will be no VAR in use. The infrastructure is obviously already in place at the Emirates, as VAR is used on a weekly basis in the Premier League or Champions League. But the system won’t be used this time around. Whether that’s a good thing or a bad thing will likely depend on each fan’s personal outlook on VAR. The obvious negative is that Arsenal may end up losing the tie on the basis of a blatantly incorrect decision that would have been addressed by VAR. But the biggest positive is that once a goal is given, there won’t be anyone checking over it with a microscope searching for reasons to rule it out."

Within 12 minutes, he’d helped his side to take the lead. The goal came from a familiar source for Arsenal fans, with Vieira whipping in a corner. The ball went all the way through the box to Nico Gonzalez at the far post, who steered it home for 1-0. Vieira played 84 minutes of the match, coming off with Porto still one ahead. The team then scored a second late in injury time to secure a 2-0 victory and three points. Though the scoreline was tight until the end, Porto dominated the 90 minutes, and Vieira had a big part in that. As well as his assist, Vieira created four further chances. Two of those five key passes were classified as ‘big chances’ by the stats providers. The 24-year-old also had a couple of shots of his own before coming off. With three goal contributions in his last four games, Vieira seems to be getting going now. He only had one assist from his first 12 matches with Porto, but it seems he just needed a goal to get back in the swing of things. Porto remain second in the Liga Portugal, two points off leaders Sporting CP. Benfica are also in the mix, two points behind Porto but with a game in hand. It could be a tight title race, so Vieira’s loan team need him at his best."

And with good reason. While his side dominated the game from start to finish, the Gunners couldn’t find a way to unlock the visitors’ defence and surrendered more points on a weekend when they might easily have made up ground on league leaders Liverpool. Having watched his side deliver a similar performance the week before at Fulham, serious questions are being asked about the Gunners’ misfiring attack. Ahead of Wednesday’s Carabao Cup game with Everton, the media returned to the idea of winning games with “magic moments” leading Arteta to define his parameters for the term. “A magic moment is not only just to score a goal,” he explained. “A magic moment can be Gabriel Magalhaes last year against Manchester United when he plays the striker [Alejandro Garnacho] offside for millimetres. That’s a magic moment as well in my opinion. “It doesn’t only have to be scoring a goal, but we have players that are capable of doing that. “Doing it every three days, that’s when you become a world-class player, a player that wins games with individual actions and we’re trying to develop our players to have more of that because that would be another source of winning games.” Arsenal have enjoyed a huge uptick in the number of goals they’ve scored in the last couple of seasons – last season’s tally in the league was the club’s highest ever – so you can understand Arteta getting prickly when asked if his side are too reliant on set-pieces. “That’s always the narrative [when you don’t score],” he said. “When you score five goals, then another five and another three, you’re not going to talk about it. When you concede, now you don’t have that many clean sheets. When you don’t score a goal you’re going to come back to that. That’s normal, that’s the narrative, but for us it doesn’t change. “We want to improve regardless of if we score three or five. Even though we didn’t concede anything on Saturday, there are still things defensively I want to do better. It doesn’t change our work.” So how does he get more attacking “magic moments” from his players. Arteta knows his players have the technical quality but they don’t always seem to have the same belief in themselves. Asked if it’s about mentality, he agreed: “A lot. Actually, making it happen and believing it can happen again, creating the fear in the opposition that a player or two can deliver that…a player can became, it’s easy to say predictable, I know what he’s going to do, but actually stopping what he’s going to do is something else.” On Saturday, Arteta’s ‘Hail Mary’ was to send on exciting teenager Ethan Nwaneri in place of out-of-sorts talisman Martin Odegaard. The academy graduate had proved he was worth a punt based on previous cameos but on this occasion couldn’t really get into the game and barely touched the ball. Interestingly, Arteta thinks Nwaneri, who predominantly plays as an attacking midfielder, could develop into a number 9 in the future – a statement that came out of the blue. Explaining why, he said: “When he’s got the goal in front of him, he just looks at the goal. He has a tremendous ability to put the ball into the back of the net.” Δ Δ Trying Nwaneri as a 9, I am all for it. Arteta is getting into Wenger’s territory now, encouraging. I may be getting ahead of myself a bit as I’d never really considered Nwaneri a number nine before, but thinking about it could he develop into what Arteta wanted Jesus to be? He may not be the tallest but like Jesus before his injuries he’s strong, hard to knock off the ball, front footed and able to beat players on the dribble. A crucial difference from Jesus however is that Nwaneri looks like a decisive finisher. The sample size may be small but I think we’ve seen enough from him to know he has that quality. Jesus unfortunately even… Read more » You never considered him as a 9 because he doesn’t have the necessary skillset, physique or pace to play there. He’s a midfieder/ inside forward in old money. If he plays him as a 9 he’s either out of ideas or clutching at straws. How different are his physical attributes from someone like Firmino, for example? A certain Ian Wright was not exceptionally tall. It could certainly be interesting to see how he could develop. It works if you play two up top I certainly would love to see havertz play with a side-kick in the box Some games i dont feel the necessecity to play two 6’s it’s funny I watched the end of that presser and Mikel first says more ambiguously “there’s another position I think he can develop into…” and the reporter asks him “can you tell us that position?” To which Mikel said “nein” which was the funniest way he’s refused to answer a question so far consdiering I don’t think German is even one of the 7 languages he speaks. Anyway, it turns out he said “nine” rather than “nein” but I think it says more about him than about me that I heard it that way! haha Lmao 😂 My main issue with us this season, and I was given stick for pointing it out at the start of the season, is trying to fix something that wasn’t broken. Around this time last year the whole talk was about a need for a striker etc. Then from January we had a consistent starting 11 with Havertz up top, Trossard on the left and the guys behind practically in place. Trust me we were facing deep blocks even then but with that team we were fluid. Think we won 18 D1 L1 But sadly city w18 D2 L0. Fast forward… Read more » Arteta has about 6 weeks to save our season. The transfer window opens in less than a couple of weeks: he absolutely must go out there and buy. A quality striker plus a left-sided attacking midfielder can save us from another disappointing season and possibly win us the title. But if he sits back and does nothing we have no chance of catching Liverpool. And then things will turn nasty. I seriously can’t see us spending big in January. Maybe in the summer if we can offload Jesus, Nelson, Zinchenko and a few other, then we might have the funds to go after a 70-80 million striker like Isak. Let’s say we get that top striker and left sided attacking midfielder. If tactically we play like we did against Fulham, bournmouth, and Everton this season then it won’t really matter who we sign. To be a top class Manager you need a plan B, and plan C, when things don’t go your way, and I think Arteta is still in the learning phase. “and I think Arteta is still in the learning phase” After FIVE F**KING YEARS?! People here just hate you instead of trying to think if your comments make sense or not. I think Fat is blog’s alterego. The dark side. Keep it confidently please! I don’t know about buying a quality striker in January. Which cl7b us selling such striker? As per you other comments of things getting “nasty”, I think I can agree, especially if Anne Slot or Enzo Maresca wins the title in their first season with their respective clubs. If that happens, it is really going to be nasty from the fans and even the players will start to lose faith in MA. Our best players might be unwilling to renew contracts. I just don’t want to think about the ripple effects this will have if we end up not winning… Read more » Except we win any of the FA, CL or even EFL cups. Our failure to win anything this season with Liverpool or Chelsea lifting some silverware will be too much to bear, even among the players. Chelsea looks on course to lift the conference cup at the moment. Liverpool already had an exceptional team. Chelsea has bought almost every living footballer. Slot and Maresca walked into far far better situations than Arteta. You must have forgotten the absolute shit show he inherited. Before he took over, whenever we played a top 6 club, we all knew in advance we were going to lose. But he’s been 5 years According to the transfermarkt most valuable teams in the world ; 1, Real Madrid ; 2, Manchester City ; 3, Arsenal FC ; 4, Chelsea FC ; 5, Liverpool FC. No excuses then, just win a fcking Carabao cup at least. Top 4 in CL is mandatory. Do name a quality striker that may be available and whose club will let him leave in January? We clearly have issues in goalscoring, and a quality striker will make us a team to compete for the title. Yet, whenever we talk about it, there are comments like who sells such a good striker. So, how other clubs buy quality strikers? Do they come from another planet? Bayern Munich showed what we were lacking last season. Arteta has the final say on transfers, we bought Merino and Califiori in the summer. He’s got a valid point even though none of you want to admit it. We can go and have a good look. Victor, won’t attempt to spell his second name. Selling club, they’ll be looking to cash in. Probably doesn’t have enough Specicifity for the accolytes on here. Can’t play the mythical left 8 position, probably doesn’t track back enough. Probably doesn’t eat all his vegetables. But he can’t stop scoring, so that would do for me. Osimhen! In all seriousness, who? Who is the striker you want that we could realistically buy in January? I don’t think anyone – including Arteta – disagrees with the fact we need those players. But that doesn’t automatically mean we can get them. I just don’t see who would be available in January who would significantly improve us. As far as I can remember, we did not buy any striker in summer as well. So no one suitable for Arsenal is available in summer nor in winter. The Charity shield comments he made was very embarrassing. No manager should seriously be proud about winning them. Hope he has higher standards. “We’ve won three – two Charity Shields too. We want more and the big ones [too], that’s for sure.” – is his full quote True, but the charity shield is nothing to brag about with the ambitions we have, unless you’re making a sp*rs fan jealous. Oh sure, I don’t disagree but I don’t think it’s a case he’s saying it’s like other trophies either. He wants to win everything. He’s very competitive How many Charity Sheilds did Arsene win? Without googling nobody could answer. How many did George Graham win?. It’s a pre season friendly. Our play is predictable, choreographed to near every movement. Without moving the ball quicker, runners of the ball to move defenders around we will have more Fulham and Everton moments. We just need to be quicker with our passing, and move a bit more when someone has the ball. Be a little aggressive, put a bit more agency in our play we will be fine. Pound for pound no one can beat us in the League, I believe that but we sometimes play into the opposition’s hands by allowing a slow tempo. Especially if Partey is not in the base… Read more » This is accurate – but I don’t think where some others are saying that it’s because Arteta wants them to be slow – it’s because they’ve not had many games to gel because of the early season issues. By all means, give me an Alexis in Jan that can cut open anyone at any time if thats a possibility. I believe a lot of the pieces – and certainly the motivation and structure are here already.

I think we need another trip to dubai soon, form was excellent after that trip last time. ………….Raya Timber…Kiwior…Gab….MLS ………………..Jorgi ……….Ethan………..Merino Sterling……..Leo……..Jesus Time to forget about the two draws, it’s not end of the world in 97.98 we were 13 points behind. Pool will loose points , we need to stick together and not let this come a mental thing, we are privileged but don’t just deserve to win games, we need to be sharp and on it. I think Jesus on the left suits him better, start Gabi and get another few mins into him, likewise Timber but get them off in 65th min . Agreed. Pool will lose points but we are also losing point at the same time pool loses points. That is the irony. Hoping that our 2nd half of the season will be completely different like last season. You have wisdom and knowledge. Arteta’s treating football like his relationships (professional ones, at least) – with full control. He needs to give up a bit of control, open up – yes it makes you vulnerable but also gives a very high probability of success. He is restricting joy out of fear of agony. Guardiola expects his players to do exactly what he asks until they get in the final third. After that, he expects them to use talent or genius to create and score the goal. Pep has Messi daddy issues, Arteta has Arsene daddy issues, with Pep, Moyes and Mourniho in his ear. He needs to make up with his inner Arsene. Doesn’t help that of the front six, only Saka can be relied on recently. The rest are collectively playing at 5/10 or worse. Sleepwalking and horseshoe football do not mix. Not sure if that is on Mikel or the players? Yes and no. Yes Saka is everything to us but Kais being superb and doing his very best . Martinelli I dunno does he need a kick in the hole or arm around him but he needs to get back to best and not be his best version of a stop and pass lateral guy, right now he’s like Denilson with speed. If Thierrys comments don’t inspire him then all is lost with Gabi Marti . Jesus is a bulloix he talks the talk but spunks before entry on the goals.

Speaking ahead of Arsenal’s Carabao Cup clash with Crystal Palace, the Spaniard was asked if and how he’ll celebrate his upcoming fifth anniversary as the main man in the Gunners’ dugout. His response caught many off guard. “I don’t drink wine!” he told reporters. “But yes it will be a special day. Obviously, five years in this job, especially the size of the club that we are is a big thing, so very grateful.” “I wouldn’t have a celebration but probably I will reflect on it, have some memories and look through some pictures and comments and a few moments that we have spent together. Recall it and value it because it’s quite a long time. For supporters, the revelation will come as a shock given Arteta fronted a campaign for Santa Rita – a Chilean winery that once partnered with the club. The origin of the meme dates back to 2020, when Arteta appeared in a video message to fans, celebrating the team’s FA Cup win from that summer. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, fans couldn’t attend the final at Wembley in person, so Arteta, holding a glass of Cabernet Sauvignon, gave a heartfelt toast to the fans watching from home, saying, “Cheers”. Since then, a screenshot of that moment has become a popular meme among supporters, who use it to toast the team’s successes and mock their rivals’ failures. Over time, the image has taken on a life of its own, becoming an integral part of the club’s online culture and a go-to reaction for the fanbase. After drawing two of the last three games, we suspect the only way Arteta will want to celebrate Thursday’s anniversary is with two wins over Palace in the space of a few days. The manager is expecting a challenging encounter when the Eagles visit the Emirates. “Very tough,” was his assessment of Oliver Glasner’s side. “When you look at the last results and the approach that they have, the quality of the individuals that they have, how they are coached as well. “It’s always really tough, it’s another layer of difficulty as well when you play a team twice in four days, so we have prepared for that.” Δ Δ Not sure if intentional but comments are off on the last article at the moment https://arseblog.news/2024/12/arteta-on-squad-fitness-and-using-the-carabao-cup-to-build-momentum/ I raise my glass to us getting back to winning ways and putting this stuck-in-the-mud first half of a season behind us. Nothing warms the cockles like good, winning football. Cheers. Not sure what happened there, but they are back! Awesome! Apologies for the double post below, wasn’t sure if the first one went through. I raise my glass with you, though Arteta’s response baffles me a bit. They didn’t ask him if he was going to celebrate with a glass of wine. It would be like if my mate asked me, “Quiet night in tonight?” and I responded, “I don’t masturbate!” Which I don’t, obviously. But you get my drift. He was asked about having wine in the press conference. So you, my friend, have needlessly said too much about what you supposedly don’t do, Mayor Freudian McSlip. You’ve caught me red handed, Ebo. Or white handed, perhaps… Obviously. Maybe he drinks Scotch, because the Basque country is the Scotland of Spain. Ask Kieran Tierney. LOL. Just win us games, Mikel. Congratulations on your 5th anniversary as an Arsenal manager. 5 years is a long time for us to still be looking fearful and devoud of ideas against lower oppositions. Where are the lessons learnt over the years when we missed the titles by losing or drawing games against West Ham, Fulham, Southampton, Aston Villa? We are solidly behind you but win us games. It is also very surprising that despite City having a stinker of a season and had been beyond terrible in the last 11 games, we are just 3 point ahead if them.… Read more » It might not be surprising that if city fail to win in the Champions league and carrabao they don’t count as points dropped in the league.

Hope that will help us in our title pursuit…… I think my trust in Arteta just decreased by a percentage point with this bombshell?98.5% now. He can regain the 1 percent by revealing himself as a connoisseur of whiskey. I recommend the Edradour 12yo for this Christmas, my gooner fam. Edradour is Scottish so it’s Whisky. Excellent choice though. I’ll try and give it a go if I can find it, thanks. Hope our upcoming performances are not EdraDour.

Speaking post-match, Arteta explained, “He has been with a little niggle for the last week or so. He has to be subbed in that moment. We have to do it.” However, the manager has since moved to ease fears, stating that Rice is “fine” and has been able to train with the team. Whether Rice features against Palace remains to be seen, particularly with a crucial league fixture against the same opposition on the horizon at the weekend. Arteta may opt for caution, keen to manage Rice’s workload amid Arsenal’s demanding schedule. Rotation remains a key focus for Arteta as he juggles injuries and the relentless frequency of matches. “We have managed the squad in the best possible way,” he said in his pre-match press conference. “We’ve made sure that everybody who is fit and available feels part of it and is ready when the team needs it. If we have to make changes, I’m sure the boys that come in will have that, and others they’re going to have to play as well because of the [shortage of] numbers.” While Rice’s availability is encouraging, Arsenal’s problems at left-back persist. Oleksandr Zinchenko, who has been absent since the match against Manchester United, remains unavailable. Zinchenko’s exclusion from the squad for the 8 December clash with Fulham raised questions over his condition, but Arteta has not yet provided clarity on his situation. The Ukrainian’s ongoing absence is undoubtedly a concern, particularly given the heavy fixture load. Riccardo Calafiori’s situation similarly remains uncertain. The Italian defender, sidelined with a groin issue since the West Ham game, is yet to be cleared for a return. Arteta previously stated, “We’re just respecting the times that the medical department has set. We monitor him every day. And we understand that he’s not fully ready yet, but he’s getting very close now.” However, Calafiori remains under assessment, with no definitive timeline for his return."

There were only two German representatives in the top 10, Toni Kroos and Florian Wirtz. Kroos was seventh in the ranking behind Lionel Messi following his role in helping Real Madrid win the Champions League and La Liga. While Wirtz was ranked 10th after he was one of Bayer Leverkusen’s key players in their unbeaten domestic season and double as well as playing a role in Germany’s progression into the quarter-finals of EURO 2024.

Although Bayern Munich completed this feat in 2013, Xabi Alonso’s side played more away games in 2024 than the Rekordmeister did under Jupp Heynckes and Pep Guardiola. Alonso’s Leverkusen didn’t lose a single one of their 17 away games in the Bundesliga in 2024, while remaining unbeaten in their two DFB Pokal games, meaning a run of 19 games without defeat, one more than Bayern in 2013. Die Werkself’s season started with a 1-0 win at Augsburg in January before a 2-0 win against the same opponents at the weekend with Martin Terrier and Florian Wirtz on the scoresheet. “This away series shows our quality,” said Granit Xhaka. “It is brutally difficult in Augsburg but we did it with total confidence from start to finish – with and without the ball. The hunger is back again.” Winning three of their opening four games, Leverkusen looked good to retain their Bundesliga title but with just one win in the six games that followed, Bayer found themselves off the pace, unable to replicate their performances from their title winning campaign. But with four successive wins and Bayern Munich losing 2-1 in Mainz, Alonso’s side now just find themselves four points behind Vincent Kompany’s side and with one game remaining before the winter break, that could close to just one point. In the final game of 2024, Bayern Munich host RB Leipzig while Bayer Leverkusen welcome Freiburg to the BayArena. GGFN | Daniel Pinder @2023 - All Rights Reserved. Get Football Group"

According to Bild, Daum - along with every member of Leverkusen's coaching staff - received the trophy from head coach Xabi Alonso ahead of Saturday's 2-0 win over Augsburg as a thank you for the work they put in last season to help the club win the German double. The report goes on to say that Alonso spent a lot of money on the gesture. He apparently paid around €6,000 to have each trophy made by Bremen silversmiths Koch und Bergfeld, who hold the licence to make the replicas. In all, he had 11 replicas made, for a total cost of between €60,000 and €70,000. I have a copy of all the trophies I have won at home. Now I have one of this championship trophy. This success is a nice memory for everyone. That's why I did it, Xabi Alonso told Bild of his gesture, which he had informed Leverkusen's managing director for sport, Simon Rolfes, of in advance. “It's a great gesture from Xabi and nice proof that the coaches are a very good team,” Rolfes is quoted as saying."

Leverkusen were asked about Wirtz’s contract situation amid reports over an extension having already been agreed: “Bayer 04 have had a very trusting and close relationship with Florian Wirtz and his family for years. Contractual matters are discussed exclusively between the Bayer 04 management and the Wirtz family. If anything changes in the current contractual situation, Bayer 04 will of course communicate that in agreement with the Wirtz family. We ask for your understanding that we will not comment further on this topic.“ Yesterday it was reported that it was looking increasingly likely that Wirtz would extend his stay at the BayArena beyond this summer, while on top of this, Bayern Munich do not have the financial funds to afford the €150m fee and €20m salary that Leverkusen would likely demand for. kicker then reported today that Wirtz had already extended his contract at Leverkusen until 2028, however the above statement confirmed this may not be the case. What is clear is that any extension for Wirtz will only be a one-year extension and it will also mean that Wirtz will likely leave the BayArena in 2026. What was also said yesterday is that Wirtz’s future is not linked to that of Xabi Alonso, so if the former Spanish midfielder leaves the club in the summer then the Pulheim native will be a key figure in the next head coach’s plans.

Lukas Kübler, Freiburg Scored a sensational brace to lead Freiburg to a 3-2 win over Wolfsburg. Danilho Doekhi, Union Berlin Rock solid at the back for Union, winning a total of 11 duels and completing 84 percent of his passes.

With just five points separating 4th and 10th, there is plenty to talk about after the fallout of matchday 14 in the Bundesliga. Bayern Munich suffered their first Bundesliga defeat of the season as a Jae-Sung Lee brace secured all three points for Mainz 05. Bayern started the brighter of the two with Micheal Olise having two decent chances in the opening 10 mins, his first effort inside five minutes rattling the post. Mainz got their noses in front as Bayern failed to clear their lines and a wicked deflection fell kindly for Lee who simply couldn’t miss. Mainz’s second, however, was anything but lucky as a beautifully crafted move on the right-hand-side found Lee in the box who cleverly turned his man and smashed the ball home. The move queued wild celebrations from the Mainz faithful including head coach Bo Henriksen who must have thought Christmas had come early. Bayern did pull one back a few minutes from time when the ball fell kindly for Leroy Sané who couldn’t miss but Mainz held on for an impressive victory. Mainz get back to winning ways following defeat to Wolfsburg and are right in the mix for European contention on 22 points in 7th. Bayern will look to bounce back in a huge game against RB Leipzig on matchday 15. Marco Rose had been under a lot of pressure at RB Leipzig in recent weeks but it appears his side have finally turned the corner and are back on track (domestically anyway). Following a winless November, the Saxons have reached the last eight of the DFB Pokal and secured back-to-back Bundesliga wins with their latest victory against Eintracht Frankfurt as Rose’s side ran out 2-1 winners. Leipzig took the lead through Benjamin Šeško who was quickest to react following a smart save from Kevin Trapp – Šeško only had eyes for the lopping ball with the Frankfurt defence perhaps a little disorientated as to where the ball had actually gone – Šeško was left to cushion the ball into the net. What followed was a flurry of chances from both sides including Frankfurt’s Omar Marmoush whose freekick rattled the crossbar and was just inches away from going in. Should that set piece have found the net, it would have been Marmoush’s third consecutive goal from a free kick. Frankfurt did get themselves level through Nathaniel Brown who is having a breakout season to remember. This was just his 7th Bundesliga game and that was his third goal having already assisted twice this campaign. He was teed up beautifully on the left as his shot cannoned against the far post and in. Leipzig got the winner five minutes into the second half when a corner was flicked onto the back post where Loïs Openda was left free to volley the ball into the net. It’s another impressive display from Marco Rose’s men who must love to welcome Frankfurt to the Red Bull Arena. The win puts Leipzig level on points with Frankfurt as they move up into 4th, breathing down the necks of Frankfurt in 3rd. Bayer Leverkusen are back up into second and four points off top spot following a 0-2 victory away at FC Augsburg. That’s now seven consecutive wins in all competitions for Xabi Alonso’s side who appear to have found their form again following a rocky opening to the season. Up next is 5th place SC Freiburg. TSG Hoffenheim scored an injury time equaliser to rescue a point away at Borussia Dortmund. The away side were more deserving of their point as they had the better opportunities and shots at goal. The draw leaves BVB in 8th on 22 points while Hoffenheim are in 14th on 14 points. VfL Bochum played the majority of their match away at Union Berlin with ten men. Despite this, they held on for a point and even took the lead in the 23rd minute. It was completely one-way traffic with constant pressure from Union but Bochum held on for what may not seem like an important point considering they haven’t a game yet but it’s a sign they haven’t given up. After this, you feel their first win is only a matter of time. GGFN | Jamie Allen @2023 - All Rights Reserved. Get Football Group"

However, that scenario now appears to be out of the question as Kicker reports that the Germany international has signed a new contract with Leverkusen. The report claims that Bayer Leverkusen have extended Wirtz's contract, which was due to expire in 2027, by at least one year. With his new deal, Wirtz has become Bayer Leverkusen's sole top earner - and by some distance. According to Kicker, the 21-year-old is the first Bayer 04 player to earn a double-digit million-euro annual salary. But at the same time, Wirtz's salary is well below the €20 million or more he could have earned at Bayern Munich if he had opted to join the Bavarians next summer. The Bavarians have been courting Wirtz for some time, but by extending his contract, Leverkusen have at least staved off interest for the time being. Wirtz has 11 goals and five assists in 24 appearances in all competitions this season."

All signs at the moment point towards Wirtz signing a contract extension at the BayArena. This would then make any more south to the Allianz Arena close to being impossible. On top of this, Wirtz’s future is not linked to the future of head coach Xabi Alonso and has already expressed the desire to continue to play for Leverkusen. It is said that Bayern lack the financial power to afford a transfer of Wirtz which could cost close to €150m on top of a salary that would be close to €20m. An increase in Wirtz’s salary with a potential contract extension would not be a problem for Leverkusen to afford either. Their participation in the Champions League means that they can afford a low double-digit million salary, ahead of Wirtz likely leaving in 2026. It also cannot be ruled out, kicker says, that Wirtz has already extended his contract at the club. GGFN | Jack Meenan @2023 - All Rights Reserved. Get Football Group"

That left Leverkusen managing director for sport Simon Rolfes with plenty to be pleased about. We concentrated on our passing and were in control of the game. We also had the feel for the right ball at the right time. It was a mature, grown-up performance, Rolfes told Sky Germany after the game. The win saw Leverkusen cut Bayern Munich's lead at the top of the table to four points after the Bavarians' surprising 2-1 defeat in Mainz. Putting the Bavarians under pressure made the win all the more pleasing, Rolfes indicated without mentioning the Bavarians by name. I have seen the results. What matters is the result here, he said. “Last year we didn't pay too much attention to what the others were doing. What we're working towards is showing our strength every three days. That puts pressure on the other clubs, in whatever form. Then they might drop points.” Eintracht Frankfurt can move back into second place, a point clear of Bayer Leverkusen and three behind Bayern, if they beat RB Leipzig on Sunday."

Here is what we learnt: For much of this season, it looked like Bayern Munich were going to be handed the Bundesliga title as the teams below them would trip over one another, however, the tide now seems to be turning. Today, Bayern lost their first game in the league this season as they succumbed to a 2-1 loss to Mainz in what was one of their worst performances of the season, but this time Jamal Musiala was unable to rescue them. At the Mewa Arena, Bayern dominated the ball but were unable to force a save from Robin Zentner for much of the game. Luck was also against them for once this season as Mainz’s first goal came from the ball being deflected and kindly dropped to Jae-Sung Lee to open the scoring, the Korean would then make it 2-0 on the hour mark. Bayern would give themselves hope when Leroy Sané scored in a wide-open goal in the 87th minute to make it 2-1. While Bayern were losing, Bayer Leverkusen continued their great form as a 2-0 win away at Augsburg means they are on a seven-game winning run but most importantly the gap between them and Bayern is now only four points. Despite being defending champions, Leverkusen would much prefer to be the chaser than the chased as pressure will begin to build on Bayern now as the honeymoon period under Vincent Kompany comes to an end. To add to this, Bayern’s final game before the winter break is against RB Leipzig. Who have proven to be an issue for Bayern over the past couple of years, even if they are not at their best. A year ago, Mainz were 17th in the Bundesliga table and looked destined for relegation. Later in the season, Bo Henriksen would then take charge and since then, Mainz have been on an upward trajectory. Twice they have beaten Borussia Dortmund and now they have also beaten Bayern Munich and each time they have deserved their wins. On top of this, the academy remains at the heart of what Mainz are achieving last season it was Brajan Gruda, this season it is Jonathan Burkardt (who was substituted off in the first half) and Paul Nebel. Then surrounding the pair there are players who don’t get enough praise in Jae-Sung Lee and Nadiem Amiri as well as young talent in Armindo Sieb (who is on loan from Bayern). Now, Mainz sit 6th in the league after winning four of their last five games. The last time they were in this position was nine years ago. Kiel lost 4-1 to Gladbach, while Bochum played out a bizarre draw with Union, but the pair are now five and eight points off of the relegation playoff places and both seem like they are heading towards the 2.Bundesliga. The pair seem to lack any quality to be able to turn their situations around. Kiel did not cause any real issue for Gladbach today, while Bochum went down to 10 men very early on in Köpenick but managed to hold on for a point. The ending of this game was also delayed as an object was thrown at Bochum keeper Patrick Drewes, which the Bochum players reacted by returning to the dressing room. After a lengthy delay, Bochum came back out, without Drewes and Philipp Hofmann playing in goal, but neither team made any effort to score. The battle for the relegation playoff also currently looks like it is down to three teams with Heidenheim, St Pauli and Hoffenheim currently battling it out.

The first chance of the afternoon fell the way of the hosts as Jonathan Burkardt dragged his shot across goal. At the other end, Michael Olise unfurled an effort that caught the outside of the post. The aforementioned Burkardt was unlucky to injure himself in the process and made way for Armindo Sieb midway through the half. Bo Henriksen's men made it a battle around part and sucked the Bavarian giants into the dogfight. Chances were few and far between after that as Bayern struggled to find a foothold. Mainz surged into an unlikely lead 4 minutes before the interval with substitute Sieb playing a pivotal role. Kim Min-Jae failed to deal with a cross which fell to the 21-year-old who picked out Jae-Sung Lee who steered past Daniel Peretz. Bo Henriksen jumped for joy in the 61st-minute as Jae-Sung Lee bagged his brace. A beautifully constructed move started by Anthony Caci's back-heel freed space for Sieb to pick out the Korean again for 2-0. Bayern eventually pulled one back in the dying embers as Joshua Kimmich's pass ricocheted off Stefan Bell leaving Leroy Sané with a routine tap-in. It would prove scant consolation in the end as Mainz hung on for victory and Bo Henriksen jumped for joy at the final whistle. The reigning Bundesliga champions found a 14th-minute lead which sent them on the path to victory at the WWK-Arena as Granit Xhaka played a key creative role. The Swiss midfielder pinged a delightful pass into Frimpong's path who cut it back for Martin Terrier to convert. The Frenchman was somewhat fortuitous to see his strike deflect off Matsima and beyond Labrović. Augsburg thought they levelled through Keven Schlotterbeck when he looped a header over Lukas Hradecky, however VAR intervention would scratch the goal out. Die Werkself would double their advantage as Florian Wirtz collected a Nathan Tella pass to drill home from a semi-acute angle. Although Die Fuggerstädters enjoyed a share of possession after the break, Jess Thorup's men couldn't seem to find a path to goal. An extra boost for Leverkusen arrived as Xabi Alonso introduced the fit-again Patrik Schick. Having learned from previous narrow victories in recent weeks, Xabi Alonso's men adopted a cautious but controlled style of play to seal three vital points and cut the gap down to 4 points from leaders Bayern Munich. Gerardo Seoane's men romped to victory this afternoon as Tim Kleindienst put the Die Fohlen-elf into a lead in the first minute. Franck Honorat availed off the passive Kiel defence to deliver the cross. Gladbach doubled their advantage in the 26th-minute as Elvedi's long ball wasn't defended well. Robin Hack supplied the perfect chip over the stranded Timon Weiner. Kiel halved the defecit with a wonder-goal from Armin Gigović from all of 24-yards on the half-hour. The Bosnian took on Joe Scally and left Moritz Nicolas with absolutely no chance as the ball sailed into the top right corner. However, the hosts restored their two-goal cushion with a corner before the break. Franck Honorat picked up his second assist of the afternoon as Alasane Plèa glanced his header inside the near post. Although Alexander Bernhardsson had a half-chance in the second period, Gladbach would eventually put the game to bed in the 79th-minute with a beautifully fluid move. Alasane Plèa and Rocco Reitz linked up to play a swift one-two. The Frenchman wrapped his right foot around the ball and beyond Weiner's fingertips to secure the spoils. An incident involving Union Berlin fans and VfL Bochum goalkeeper Patrick Drewes in injury time has called a halt to the action abruptly. Union Berlin players are back out on the pitch awaiting VfL. We will have a report to follow at full-time."

While they may be in the bottom half of the table, Augsburg are closer to the European places than they are to the drop zone, with five points separating them from the top six, compared with the six-point gap between themselves and the bottom three. The Fuggerstädter have proven to be a tough team to beat in recent times, having lost one of their previous eight matches in all competitions. That sole victory took place in last month’s away clash against Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich. However, Augsburg quickly bounced back to claim a 1-0 win over Bochum, before they beat Karlsruhe on penalties to seal their spot in the DFB-Pokal quarter-finals. Jess Thorup’s side then returned to league action with a hard-fought 2-2 draw in their away meeting with second-placed Eintracht Frankfurt. After picking up a useful point at Deutsche Bank Park, Augsburg will now return to the home comforts of the WWK Arena, where they are unbeaten in four league matches (W3, D1). The hosts are unable to call upon Masaya Okugawa, Mads Pedersen, Yusuf Kabadayi, Finn Dahmen, Fredrik Jensen and Reece Oxford. Leverkusen have put together a run of six consecutive victories since they were held to a 1-1 draw in their away meeting with Bochum. They kicked off that winning run with home victories over Heidenheim and Red Bull Salzburg in the league and Champions League respectively. Xabi Alonso’s side went on to record Bundesliga wins against Union Berlin and St. Pauli on either side of a narrow victory against ten-man Bayern Munich in the Pokal. Their winning streak looked set to end in Tuesday’s Champions League home clash against Inter Milan until Nordi Mukiele netted a 90th-minute winner. That moved Leverkusen into fourth position with two games left to play in the league phase. After enjoying success in European action, die Werkself will now turn their focus back to their Bundesliga title defence. The third-placed side have work to do if they are to win back-to-back league titles, with seven points separating them from leaders Bayern. Die Werkself will fancy their chances of beating Augsburg, having won four of their previous six head-to-head away meetings, including a narrow 1-0 win on their most recent trip to the WWK Arena in January. Leverkusen will have to assess Patrik Schick’s fitness ahead of Saturday’s away trip. The visitors will definitely be without the services of Jonas Hofmann, Amine Adli and Victor Boniface."

Patrik Schick could return to the starting 11 after he missed last weekend’s 2-1 win against St Pauli before sitting on the bench for the full 90 minutes in midweek. In his place, Nathan Tella has been used as a number nine, quite successfully. Martin Terrier could also be used as a striker as he too has recently returned from injury. There could also be a change in midfield with Robert Andrich and Aleix Garcia both coming in to replace Exequiel Palacios and Nordi Mukiele. The duo were used as late substitutes against Inter in midweek to help sure up the defence to secure the win. Very drastic change in personnel is likely not expected as Leverkusen do lack alternative options and they only have two games left before the winter break. On top of this, it is very hard to guess what formation head coach Xabi Alonso will play.

I didn't take part in pre-season, didn't play in a friendly either.” “When I arrived here, the team was ready for the Bundesliga, but I wasn't. Then I worked even harder,” said the Frenchman after making eight appearances in all competitions for the champions this campaign. Mukiele arrived on loan from Paris Saint Germain in the summer after a far-from-ideal spell in the French capital, with just 35 appearances between 2022 and 2024. Mukiele returned to the Bundesliga after spending four years at RB Leipzig before his Parisian move. Speaking on Tuesday's clash of champions at the BayArena between Leverkusen and Inter, the 27-year-old said that, “After the first half, we said they we just had to keep going until the last minute. And that's what we did, and I scored in the last minute. “I'm very happy about that and our performance.” Teammate Granit Xhaka also spoke out regarding the Frenchman. “Every start in life is not easy. Coming into a new team after this season, in which everything was perfect for us, is probably even more difficult, but Nordi is a player who can play in different positions and has a mentality that is very important.” “He is very stable defensively and physically. The fact he's now scoring also scoring goals is all the better.” Tuesday's result saw die Werkself jump to second in the standings behind leaders Liverpool, who overcame Leverkusen by four goals to nil in November. Mukiele and Leverkusen now turn their attentions to a trip to Augsburg on Saturday afternoon after a recent uptick in form after an inconsistent run."

Last season, England also looked a stick-on for an additional spot following the group stages of the three continental competitions. But a poor performance across the knockouts left them third in the coefficient table. Only the top four finishers in the Premier League qualified for the Champions League as a result, meaning Tottenham missed out and entered the Europa League. England had finished in the top two of the coefficient table in six of the previous seven seasons but the Premier League suffered its lowest coefficient total since 2016/17 - and it would have been even lower but for the introduction of the Conference League in 2021/22. This time around, however, Chelsea have blown away all before them in the Conference League, while Liverpool have a 100 per cent record from their opening six Champions League games. Arsenal are in third, while Villa sit fifth with two league games remaining. Manchester United, meanwhile, are unbeaten in the Europa League - the same competition in which Spurs currently sit ninth. Of all the teams that are in danger of an early elimination, it is English champions Manchester City - currently 22nd in the Champions League standings and with work to do. Why exact league places matter in CL Champions League fixtures Champions League results Stream Sky Sports with NOW But according to Opta, England have an incredible 98.5 per cent chance at present of being awarded the coveted extra spot for the 2025/26 campaign - ahead of Italy and Spain. In the coefficient standings, a win is worth two points, a draw one and there are also bonus points for reaching certain stages of competitions. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player To achieve automatic qualification into the round of 16 in March, teams must finish in the top eight. Those who finish ninth to 16th will be seeded for the play-offs, so will have the second leg at home. Those from 17th to 24th will be unseeded, so have the first leg at home. Teams that finish anywhere from 25th to 36th will be eliminated from this season's competition, with no access to the Europa League. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Yes, it does. The final league position gives you a specific route - and specific opponents - in the knockout draw. The below graphic shows the tournament tree for the rest of the competition. For the first time, the knockout rounds are decided by the league phase - with no separate draws for the last 16, quarter-finals and beyond. For example, the teams that finish first or second in the league phase will face a team that finishes in 15th, 16th, 17th or 18th. Compare that to the team that finishes in seventh or eighth, who could play a team that finishes in 23rd or 24th - but also run the risk of facing the team in ninth or 10th spot - which could be a major European outfit. The advantage for the team finishing first or second is they will guarantee playing a team in the 'middle' of the final Champions League table. Finishing lower down runs the risk of playing a better side. Not necessarily. Particularly this season. The early struggles of teams such as Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain mean a top European side could end up in the 'middle' of the Champions League table - thereby coming up against one of the best-performing sides. Currently, Liverpool are top of the league table - but the teams who began this gameweek in 15th, 16th, 17th and 18th are Benfica, Monaco, Sporting and Feyenoord - with PSG, Real Madrid and Man City below those teams in the table. So if top teams continue to not do as well as expected in the league phase, it could create some blockbuster last-16 ties, thereby taking away the advantage of finishing in the highest possible spots. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Again, yes. A big one. And it's all to do with the play-offs. The new Champions League format means the team that finishes ninth faces the team in 24th in the play-off round. Tenth plays 23rd, 11th plays 22nd and so on. So if you just miss out on a top-eight finish, the blow is softened by playing the worst-performing sides that qualified from the league phase. So the higher you finish, the 'easier' game you get. But again, if teams such as Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain struggle in the league phase, you could have top sides meeting each other in the play-off rounds. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player The Opta supercomputer believes 16 points would almost certainly be enough to finish in the top eight, which then guarantees you a last-16 spot in March. Liverpool have surpassed that tally having won all of their six games so far, while Aston Villa are just one win away from that checkpoint. The data also believes 15 points could be enough to sneak into eighth place, with that points tally being enough in 73 per cent of Opta's 50,000 simulations of the league phase. Meanwhile, 14 points is unlikely to be enough for a top-eight finish. Arsenal are currently on 13 points, so victory over Dinamo Zagreb in their next Champions League game in January should seal a top-eight finish. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player To finish in the top 24, which guarantees you a play-off spot at least, Opta believes 10 points will almost certainly guarantee you a place in that round. Liverpool, Arsenal and Aston Villa have already reached that tally, but City and Celtic still have a bit of work to do. Celtic are currently on nine points after their goalless draw at Dinamo Zagreb, but City still lie on eight points with two matches to go. They face PSG and Club Brugge in those matches. Nine points could also be enough to finish 24th, in a boost to City, with that points tally being enough in 69 per cent of the simulations. But eight points runs the risk of elimination, with that points tally being sufficient in just 16 per cent of the simulations. The Opta supercomputer predicts Liverpool, Arsenal and Aston Villa are set to finish in the top eight, with Arne Slot's side staying top, the Gunners in third and Villa in seventh. On current form, Manchester City and Celtic are set to finish in 22nd and 18th. The supercomputer also says PSG are on course to finish 24th - avoiding elimination by the skin of their teeth. Liverpool are currently the favourites to win the Champions League, with Slot's side given a 20 per cent chance of winning the trophy in Munich after a stellar start to the season. Arsenal are third favourites with 13.2 per cent - just ahead of Pep Guardiola's Man City - fourth favourites on 9.3 per cent. Inter Milan are second favourites on 15.8 per cent - with Atalanta, Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Real Madrid, Bayer Leverkusen and Sporting making up the top 10. Aston Villa have a 0.6 per cent chance of winning the entire tournament, which is twice as likely as Celtic on 0.3 per cent.

No. There's are too many variables and the 'O' [in DOGSO - Denying a goal or an obvious goalscoring opportunity] stands for obvious and not possible.

DERMOT SAYS: I think it's a foul [by Rogers on Anderson before he enters the box] and he [Anderson] then grabs hold of him going into the box. I think it's then a penalty but I think the best outcome here in fairness is the VAR to recommend to the referee to go to the monitor so he has all options open. He then would have seen Rogers ripping his [Anderson's] shirt right off his back and he can then give a free-kick [to Forest]. You've got the same net result of no penalty but people accept it better because that's actually happened. INCIDENT: Nottingham Forest's winner against Aston Villa stands despite a possible foul on Matty Cash in the build-up. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player DERMOT SAYS: It depends who you talk to, some think it is a foul, some do not - what I would say is you can't re-referee football matches. The referee has a good position and says it is no foul and play on and certainly not one for VAR - if you are interfering with that, then you are going to be looking at every single incident on the field.

When it looks like a draw, walks like a draw, quacks like a draw, then it's probably a draw. And it becomes an interesting betting angle when that outcome is priced up as the outsider of the three at 11/4 with Sky Bet. When it comes to draws these two teams are superb at them. Crystal Palace have drawn a Premier League-high seven games this season and Brighton have drawn six - the joint second-most games. Six of the last 10 meetings have also ended 1-1. Keep the draw on your side. The fallen-giant derby. Both teams are on their lowest points total after 15 Premier League games. This sharp decline of Manchester City is becoming a maddening thing to unpack with Pep Guardiola's insistence that City are playing well while acting uncharacteristically hapless in trying to fix it is certainly adding to the circus of it all. Download the Sky Sports app Stream Sky Sports with NOW Get Sky Sports on WhatsApp Watch free Premier League highlights The defensive numbers behind City's results of seven defeats in 10 are extraordinary - a sackable offence for most managers. Since October 5, City are working at a per-game average of conceding 2.79 big chances on their goal - only Ipswich and Southampton have a worse return. Teams are charging past them in transition at will and their per-game average of being dribbled past figure of 10.36 is extraordinary - only West Ham have a higher average. Guardiola's side have conceded two or more goals in nine of their last 10 matches, meaning the 7/4 with Sky Bet on Manchester United following suit and scoring at least twice is the value call in a winnable game for Ruben Amorim if he gets his tactics right to expose City's laughable make-up out of possession. Why aren't Chelsea serious title contenders? It's a question I've been pondering as they've shortened dramatically into 6/1 with Sky Bet for the Premier League crown. The inconsistency factor is high on that reasoning. Teams that win titles win matches when not playing well. I'm not sure this young Chelsea side are there yet - there are going to be bumps in the road, especially with such an unreliable goalkeeper in Robert Sanchez between the sticks. That bump could be on the horizon here. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Credit to them they've managed to fend off a funny result for most of the season but one might be due, which may help dampen the expectations in the long run. Brentford haven't lost to Chelsea in five matches, winning the last three at Stamford Bridge. Yes, Thomas Frank's football isn't quite as savage on the road but they will hold no fear and Chelsea look a risky prospect at 1/3 with Sky Bet for the win, especially at an odd kick-off time. Brentford double chance at 9/4 it is then. Tyler Dibling is going to win Southampton a game on his own soon - he's that good. And in truth, Russell Martin probably needs him to as the Saints carry little attacking threat, bar the exciting vibes that Dibling brings. This might be the night where Dibling delivers a big one. Defences don't come as generous as Tottenham's without Micky van de Ven - he is so instrumental to Ange Postecoglou's style of football and his weak hamstrings will probably be the big Aussie's downfall as Spurs look flat, timid and a shell of their best at the moment. Dibling to score in a home win at 9/1 with Sky Bet stands out. Andoni Iraola's unique and hard-to-stop football is surely going to land him a top job soon enough - if a vacancy were to come up at Tottenham for example, Iraola should be their number one priority. In the last 44 games, Iraola has Bournemouth as the sixth-best team in the Premier League - that is an outrageous achievement for a club who were only promoted two seasons ago. Just look at how subsequent promoted teams have fared, it's no easy task. They are a better football team in every department than West Ham, who once again looked quite stodgy and lacking identity in their important win over Wolves. The home win is skinny enough at 7/10 with Sky Bet but adding under 4.5 goals into the mix gets us to a 5/4 shot that makes sense considering the Cherries have seen under that line in 10 of their last 12 home matches.

The midfielder renewed his deal until 2028 but he’ll have a €20M release clause starting from 2026. He could be a bargain if he continues to grow. He’s already a pillar of his side.

He has ten caps with Germany U-21 and trained with the senior team ahead of Euro 2024. He can handle every position in the midfield and has been likened to the early Nicolò Barella. He fits their reported new strategy, and Henrikh Mkhitaryan, while seemingly evergreen, won’t keep going forever.

Simone Inzaghi’s high-flying side inflicted Lazio’s first home league defeat this season to move within three points of table-topping Atalanta. Lazio and Inter were level on points ahead of the kick-off, and there was nothing to separate the teams until the 41st minute. However, Samuel Gigot’s reckless handball inside the box sent Hakan Calhanoglu to the spot. The Turkish midfielder made no mistake to break the deadlock. Only four minutes later, Inter doubled their lead through Federico Dimarco. The Italian wingback latched on to Denzel Dumfries’ cross on the back post to make it 2-0 at halftime. It took the Nerazzurri six minutes into the second half to put the game to bed as Nicolo Barella scored a stunning long-range half-volley. Lazio failed to recover from the shock, letting Inter assume complete control of the proceedings. After delivering an assist, Dumfries found the net with a towering header, extending the visitors’ advantage in the 53rd minute to four! However, Inzaghi’s team refused to rest on their laurels. Second-half substitute Carlos Augusto got to the scoresheet for the first time this season with a clinical left-footed finish from inside the box for Inter’s fifth. Marcus Thuram put the icing on the cake in the 90th minute with a fantastic solo effort, capping off a scintillating performance. Let’s look at our player ratings. Yann Sommer – 6 It was a quiet night for the Swiss goalkeeper, who didn’t have to make a single save since thwarting Gustav Isaksen’s early effort. Yann Bisseck – 6.5 Slotted in for Benjamin Pavard, the German defender fared well against Mattia Zaccagni but picked up a cheap yellow card toward the end of the first half. Stefan de Vrij – 7.5 The Dutchman rolled back the years against his former side, delivering a defensive masterclass to neutralize in-form Tijjani Noslin. Impeccable in possession! Alessandro Bastoni – 7 Had it not been for a harsh tackle that earned him a booking midway through the first half, it would’ve been a faultless showing from the star center-back. Denzel Dumfries – 8 Incredible performance! In addition to racking up a goal and an assist, the ex-PSV Eindhoven wingback was a permanent threat down the right flank all game. Nicolo Barella – 7.5 His sublime long-range screamer will make Serie A highlights until the end of the season. What a thunderbolt! Hakan Calhanoglu – 7.5 Back to the scoreboard with another well-taken penalty, the deep-lying playmaker did what he does best – dictating the pace with inch-perfect passing and unparalleled vision. Henrikh Mkhitaryan – 7 Despite failing to get his name on the board, the Armenian veteran was superb tonight, completing numerous progressive runs and linking up well with his teammates. Federico Dimarco – 7.5 A vintage Dimarco display! Brimming with confidence after scoring his third Serie A goal this season, the Inter stalwart picked up an assist and created havoc inside Lazio’s penalty area after the break. Lautaro Martinez – 6 The Argentine’s frustrating campaign goes on. Even though the Nerazzurri netted six, he wasn’t among the scorers. Marcus Thuram – 7.5 Unlike his attacking comrade, the Inter talisman grabbed a well-deserved late goal after driving Lazio’s defenders crazy all night.

He’s already on the radar of a few European powerhouses such as Arsenal, Barcelona, Chelsea, and Real Madrid, Goal Brasil reports (via Calciomercato). The Nerazzurri reached out to intermediaries to gather intel about the budding center-back. They wish to understand whether there’s room to set up the deal since the prodigy has been heavily linked to Los Galacticos. The Spanish giants have already made their first offer for Vitor Reis, while Inter are in the early stages of their pursuit. In any case, Palmeiras don’t want to part ways with him in January. He’s been at the club since he was ten. The defender debuted in the pros last June and has progressively earned more minutes. He has tallied 22 appearances this season. He has earned a contract until 2028 with a €100M release clause. He’s been compared to Thiago Silva. His side has a lot of leverage and set a €40M price tag. They seem ready to change their MO after years of spending little on the market, focusing on Bosman deals and reinvesting what they got from the sales. On the other hand, it remains to be seen how much they’ll be comfortable spending for any single acquisition. Surefire prospects don’t come cheap. Keeping one veteran as a mentor and a starlet behind him would be the right strategy. De Vrij is in the lead as he’s a little younger and has been healthier than Acerbi this campaign.

There’s nothing but goal difference to separate the teams ahead of the kick-off, with both trailing table-topping Atalanta by six points. Atalanta’s 1-0 triumph at Cagliari on Saturday has ramped up the pressure on Lazio and Inter to get into the win column. Marco Baroni’s men have frequently been there this season. A 3-1 win at Ajax in the UEFA Europa League last midweek solidified their momentum after beating Napoli in a mouth-watering doubleheader. Last weekend’s 1-0 victory at Stadio Diego Maradona reignited Lazio’s spirits following a disappointing 3-1 defeat at newcomers Parma. Gustav Isaksen’s late winner on a rainy night in Naples restored confidence around the Biancocelesti camp amid hot pursuit of only a third Serie A title in the club’s history. Inter will be out to hinder Lazio’s chances of returning to the throne for the first time since 1999/20, seeking redemption for a heart-wrenching defeat at Bayer Leverkusen last Tuesday. Nordi Mukiele’s 90th-minute goal denied the Nerazzurri a piece of UEFA Champions League history, knocking them down from a five-game unbeaten start (W4, D1). Simone Inzaghi’s men were minutes away from becoming the first Champions League team to go the first six matches of a new campaign without conceding. It was also Inter’s first scoring blank on the road in five games (W4, L1), heightening the pressure on Lautaro Martinez and his teammates to get a result in Rome. Lazio Despite four defeats across the opening 15 matchdays, Lazio head into proceedings as one of only three sides to have hit double digits in terms of league victories (W10, D1). Most of their good work has come on this ground, where Baroni’s charges boast a near-flawless top-flight record this season (W6, D1). As one of only four Serie A sides yet to lose a home match in 2024/25, Lazio stand out as one of the most formidable hosts in European football (W8, D2). Delivering action from the get-go, they have opened the scoring in seven of those eight wins, highlighting the potential for a quick-fire start. Given the strength of their opposition, nothing less would do on Monday. However, Lazio won’t shy away from the challenge. They may have slumped to a 2-0 defeat in this corresponding fixture last term, but they had enjoyed a prolific home run against Inter beforehand. Indeed, three victories from four previous duels at this venue (D1) perfectly encapsulate their ability to rise to the occasion in high-stakes encounters. Inter Inter had to swallow a bitter pill in Germany last week, relinquishing a remarkable 13-game unbeaten streak in all competitions (W11, D2). But it was nothing less than Leverkusen deserved, considering they had the Nerazzurri on the ropes all game. Whether it was fatigue or Inzaghi’s tactical choice, Inter didn’t look like a team capable of weathering the storm against a high-intensity opponent. However, equipped with confidence from their recent domestic triumphs, the visitors return to Serie A action, searching for a tenth consecutive unbeaten league outing (W7, D2). They’ve been particularly outstanding on the road. Along with Juventus, they’re the only Serie A side yet to lose an away league game this season (W4, D2). It’s also worth noting that they’ve won on their last four top-flight travels, including a 1-0 triumph at this stadium against Roma. That result initiated a run of three successive away league wins ‘to nil,’ bookended by an outrageous 5-0 rout of Hellas Verona in which they scored all goals before the break. In addition to long-term absentee Alessio Romagnoli, Lazio will be without their leading goalscorer, Taty Castellanos, for accumulated yellow cards. On the bright side, Luca Pellegrini and Patric have passed fit for this meeting after minor fitness problems forced them to withdraw in Amsterdam. As for Inter, Francesco Acerbi and Benjamin Pavard remain on the sidelines. It means ex-Lazio star Stefan de Vrij and 24-year-old Yann Bisseck will join forces with Alessandro Bastoni at the back. After commencing on the bench against Leverkusen, Nicolo Barella and Henrikh Mkhitaryan will likely regain their places in the midfield. Lazio (4-2-3-1): Provedel; Lazzari, Gila, Romagnoli, Tavares; Guendouzi, Rovella; Isaksen, Dia, Zaccagni; Noslin. Inter (3-5-2): Sommer; Bisseck, De Vrij, Bastoni; Dumfries, Barella, Calhanoglu, Mkhitaryan, Dimarco; Martinez, Thuram. Although Lazio are perfectly capable of causing an upset, it takes a brave man to bet against Inter. Both sides enter this round in fine form, but the visitors’ strength in depth gives them a cutting edge. Yet, even without Castellanos, the hosts have the tools to topple their former manager. Therefore, our recommendation is to kick back and enjoy the contest. It promises to be a memorable affair. Your email address will not be published.

During his recent interview with Telemundo Deportes via Calciomercato, Simeone highlighted Inter’s meteoric rise to the continent’s elite under Simone Inzaghi. Despite lacking a ‘classic‘ superstar, Inter boast a star-studded squad. Above all, Simeone appreciates the team’s chemistry, crediting Inzaghi for creating a perfect mix of seasoned veterans and up-and-coming talents. “Today, which are the three best teams in the world? Barcelona, Inter, and Manchester City. I like Inter a lot; it’s a team without a star but with many important players,” the former Nerazzurri star said. “The work of Simone Inzaghi has created the ability to compete in the best way possible with a practical and dynamic style of play. He has done very well in recent seasons, reaching the Champions League final and winning the Scudetto. They are a team, they are a team!“ Simeone’s statement isn’t far from the truth. Despite last midweek’s late heartbreak at Bayer Leverkusen, Inter have been a force to be reckoned with in the Champions League and Serie A under Inzaghi. They’re well-positioned to secure automatic knockout qualification at Europe’s top table and are firmly in the running for a second consecutive Scudetto. Being praised by one of Europe’s most respected managers is the ultimate testament to the progress and consistency Inter have achieved under Inzaghi.

Speaking to the press in the build-up to Saturday’s Premier League clash against Fulham via Calciomercato, the Dutchman confirmed the former Juventus winger lacks regular first-team action. Chiesa left Turin to join Liverpool in a £10 million deal in the summer after being deemed surplus to requirements by new Juventus manager Thiago Motta. However, he has only collected 78 minutes on Merseyside this season across three cameo appearances. Low in the pecking order, Chiesa could soon request a transfer, with several Serie A clubs vying for his signature. In addition to long-term admirers Inter, Milan and Roma are keen on bringing the unsettled Reds star back to his homeland. “What he needs is to play, the problem is that if he hasn’t played for five or six months, sometimes it’s difficult for a coach to give him his first minutes because you don’t exactly know what to expect,” Slot said about Chiesa. “Yes, I see him on the training pitch, but ideally, it would be better to see him in a friendly during the week, or in an Under-21 match or something like that. But this is not our situation: we play so many matches. So maybe the game against Southampton could be a good moment for him to get some minutes on the field, and then we’ll know a bit better what we can expect from him. “If you only have training sessions, it’s not the same as game time. You need game time to reach certain levels of fitness. But if you are fighting for the championship and fighting in the Champions League, it’s not always easy to find these minutes unless sometimes we are ahead 4-0 or 5-0, but I think that has only happened once all season.“ Chiesa has lost his place on the national team.

According to Radio Kiss Kiss via TMW, Partenopei sporting director Giovanni Manna has switched his sights on Inter stalwart Stefan de Vrij. Danilo has recently emerged as a concrete transfer target for Napoli after losing his indispensable first-team status under Thiago Motta. However, long-term injuries to Gleison Bremer and Juan Cabal have thrown the Brazilian veteran a lifeline at the Allianz Stadium. Strapped for reliable options at the back, Motta has reinstated Danilo, whose deal at Juventus runs out at the end of the season. Napoli had hoped to capitalize on the 33-year-old’s contract wobble before deciding to focus on other targets. Juventus are having second thoughts about Danilo’s future at the club. After initially deciding against renewing his expiring contract, they are now open to offering him a short-term extension. Therefore, Napoli have identified De Vrij as a new top defensive target. The 32-year-old Dutchman has been outstanding since swapping Lazio for Giuseppe Meazza in 2018. However, he’ll be out of contract in the summer of 2025, with Inter seemingly reluctant to propose fresh terms. That could change if De Vrij continues to go from strength to strength. Indeed, the rumored Napoli target has excelled in Francesco Acerbi’s absence, delivering outstanding performances in numerous high-profile matches.

Quickly after being admitted to the hospital, the Fiorentina youngster spent a couple of days in the intensive care unit of Careggi before being transferred to the UTC. Thankfully, Bove has fully recovered and is ready to return to Viola Park to greet his teammates and manager, Raffaele Palladino. However, Bove’s career in Serie A is over. He will no longer be allowed to compete in professional sports in Italy, mirroring the case of Christian Eriksen, who had to leave Inter in 2021. The Fiorentina starlet must wait to receive comprehensive documentation from his tests, which will determine whether his myocarditis is genetic or inflammatory in origin, helping to assess the potential risks he might face moving forward. As for Fiorentina, they’ll likely dive back into the market this winter to strengthen Palladino’s midfield options amid La Viola’s incredible season in Serie A.

According to a report by Daniele Longo, Juventus and Inter are eyeing a potential free transfer for Leverkusen’s Tah next summer. The German defender’s contract with Xabi Alonso’s side expires in June 2025 and any club interested in him can agree on a transfer without dealing with his current club. Juventus and Inter do not want to miss out on a strong and proven centre-back as they aim to send him proposals this winter but it appears that Barcelona have emerged as the frontrunners in the race to land Tah. The Blaugranas’ sporting director Deco has contacted the 28-year-old’s entourage but is yet to accept their conditions. As for the Italian sides, neither Juventus nor Inter can match the Tah’s demands but negotiations are set to take place even though Barcelona have the edge.

We started slowly because of the short turnaround with the previous campaign. We got back on track. At the end of August, we would have signed to be in this situation in the Champions League and Serie A.” Bastoni addressed the loss to Bayer Leverkusen. “A defeat is never easy to stomach, but, analyzing everything, you just need to look at where Bayern Munich, Manchester City, and Real Madrid are to see that we’re doing well. If you are used to excellence, you have to maintain that standard. Clearly, we can’t win every game. It’s ludicrous to argue with the rotations. It wouldn’t be normal to always be 100 percent mentally. And the team suffers if you aren’t. Resting is essential.” Bastoni had the chance to leave in the past. “Some sides inquired about me, but I’ve always given my priority to Inter. There’s a life outside of football, and my family is great here. Plus, this club fights to win every competition. I’ve never given half a thought to leaving.” The center-back discussed Simone Inzaghi. “His virtue is that he makes everybody feel part of the group and fundamental to the cause. Instead, a defect was maybe that we had trouble understanding his football at first. That’s partly up to us since had Antonio Conte who was completely different.” Bastoni made his pick between winning another Scudetto or reaching the Champions League final again. “Surely the latter. We lacked some luck and self-awareness in Istanbul. We know that we’re at that level now.” Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked * Comment * Name * Email * Website Δ"

The defender is reportedly close to agreeing to a contract with Barcelona, but the race is still somewhat open. He denied having convened with Blaugrana director Deco after the reports. According to La Gazzetta dello Sport, the Nerazzurri have no doubts about his level and fit. His performance against them further proved it. On the other hand, they aren’t the only side chasing him, and his demands are significant. The summit between the Inter brass and the entourage of Tah was mostly preliminary. The parties set the stage for possible future discussions. The salary requested by the defender is too high for the Serie A side’s standards at this stage, but they haven’t completely shut the door for now. Oaktree plots to progressively do away with Bosman signings involving veterans with high wages. On the other hand, the German international isn’t too old, as he’s 28. The outcome of their chase depends on how much other teams will offer. In the meantime, the Scudetto holders are mulling whether to add to their backline in January already. Francesco Acerbi continues to struggle to stay healthy. He’s not expected to return versus Lazio either. Despite Udinese’s stance, Jaka Bijol would be their top target if they opted to make a move. He’ll be a great get for whoever signs him, but it’d be surprising if it were the Nerazzurri given the latest hints about their future strategy.

It’s the first time it has happened in three years. The Nerazzurri were seemingly settling for a draw but gave up a late goal. Per La Gazzetta dello Sport, they had last failed to have an attempt on goal back in February of 2022 in a Champions League bout versus Liverpool. While their results have been sound, their frontline hasn’t been fearsome. Marcus Thuram has been their lone consistent scorer, while Lautaro Martinez has been up and down, and their deputies, including Mehdi Taremi, whom they landed after a lengthy chase, have brought very little to the table. While that’s not a surprise for Marko Arnautovic and Joaquin Correa, who have seen the pitch sparingly, Inter were expecting more from the Iranian marksman. He has started in every continental match but has found the target just once. He has yet to do it in Serie A. While Thuram has carried the burden, Martinez has hit the net six times and is way behind schedule relative to his standards. He has squandered major chances too. The issue is there but it’s a first-word one for now. They have still collectively bagged 34 goals in Serie A, which makes them the second-most prolific side league-wide, and their results haven’t suffered. El Toro isn’t new to multi-month slumps, and they’ll go on a run once he catches fire. It’ll be a problem for other sides since Thuram has gone up a level and his pace seems totally sustainable.

His agent and intermediary Serxhio Mezi revealed that he has been in touch with the Azzurri to set up the deal in an interview with Tribuna. “I’ve been talking with Napoli for a year. He could have joined them last January. We discussed about it with director Mauro Meluso and worked on such a transfer with Ciro Palermo. I don’t know if the deal will go through, but the two presidents are friendly, which could help in the negotiation.” Instead, Mezi instead dismissed the chatter about Inter and Juventus. “He’s been linked, but there’s nothing there. Thiago Motta didn’t want him when he was at Bologna. I doubt that the Bianconeri will chase him even if they are looking for a center-back.” Ismajli is in a particular situation because his contract lasts only until the end of the season. “Do you think a Serie A team would spend €2M, €3M, or €4M for a 29-year-old player they could sign on a free in June? Napoli are a different matter. He was offered to Roma and Daniele De Rossi too. Though, they discarded him because they didn’t think he was ready for that level.” It looks like the Partenopei have the inside track. Being a reliable deputy in a top team is arguably the right dimension for him. Perhaps a multi-player deal or a short-term renewal with a low release clause would facilitate a small investment in light of his contractual status. Your email address will not be published.

The 20-year-old winger's performances are likely to have attracted interest from other clubs, but Borussia Dortmund are keen to keep hold of him. When asked what he would do if someone from another club called and offered €50 million for Gittens, Borussia Dortmund's managing director for sport, Lars Ricken, told Sport Bild: I wouldn't hang up immediately because that's not my character. But I would respectfully decline.” He wouldn't say what kind of fee would make Dortmund consider selling the young winger, but simply added: “We are in a challenging situation and we want to develop from a sporting point of view. Basically, we want to keep players of such high quality for longer. This also applies to Jamie, who has a long-term contract.” Gittens, who is contracted to Borussia Dortmund until 2028, has scored nine goals and provided four assists in 22 appearances this season."

The report claims that Wanner's name is coming up more and more frequently in meetings held by the club's management. Wanner and his agent are aware of Dortmund's general interest, but no concrete negotiations have yet taken place. Ideally, Dortmund would like to sign Wanner permanently, but with Bayern currently unwilling to sell, they've discussed the possibility of taking the 18-year-old out on loan, believing he can make an immediate impact, even in the Champions League. Wanner himself would like to be a regular in a Champions League side next year. As he would likely get more playing time at Dortmund than at Bayern, that could argue for a move to Signal Iduna Park. Wanner has scored six goals and provided two assists in 21 appearances for Heidenheim this season."

They were boring. The worst kind of bad. Borussia Dortmund put in a poor performance against Hoffenheim on Sunday afternoon but it looked like they would come away with three points anyway, following a brilliant Gio Reyna goal scored at the beginning of the second half. Unfortunately, former BVB player Jacob Bruun Larsen found the Hoffenheim equalizer in the 91st minute, which was no less than they deserved. Hoffenheim were the better side in a drab game that was light in both quality and entertainment. They were well organized and had the best of the game’s few goalscoring opportunities. It wasn’t a dazzling Hoffenheim performance, but there were at least some positives for the away side. In contrast, Dortmund seemed utterly devoid of ideas or creativity and can consider themselves lucky to come away with anything from this game. BVB had shown some signs of progress under Nuri Şahin recently, but this was a return to the same issues Dortmund have struggled with this season. They struggled for anything resembling consistent offense, relying too heavily on a moment of magic from someone to give them the advantage. Once ahead, they never looked like holding onto their lead. A draw at home against Hoffenheim isn’t good enough, but the more significant issue was the performance. It was lifeless. Here are our ratings from Sunday’s 1-1 draw with Hoffenheim. Paul: 5 Sean: 5 Bruun-Larsen’s goal was Hoffenheim’s only shot against, but it would be unfair to hold it against Kobel too much. Paul: 4 Sean: 5 Couto got beaten on the dribble a few times. Paul: 5 Sean: 6 Paul: 6 It was a shock to see Schlotterbeck in the starting eleven after he was stretchered off at the end of the Barcelona game with what looked like a serious injury. He held his own against Hoffenheim, which is especially impressive given the assumption we wouldn’t see him on the pitch for a while. Sean: 6 It must be so disappointing that Nico battled back from that injury so quickly, only to play in a total dud of a game. Paul: 5 Bensebaini got burned a couple of times on the defensive end. He had a stronger game on the other end of the ball. Sean: 5 Paul: 6 Hoffenheim took Nmecha out of the game a bit, but he was still one of Dortmund’s brighter sparks. Sean: 6 Paul: 5 Groß had some bright moments, but it wasn’t a brilliant performance. I think he needs a rest. Sean: 6 His set-piece deliveries continue to be decent, but that’s about it at the moment. Paul: 7 I’m probably being a little generous here because of the goal and because there was so little else to cheer. It’s nice to see Reyna playing football and getting on the scoresheet. Sean: 6 Yeah, outside of the goal, he didn’t do much of anything. Paul: 4 He didn’t seem to offer much of anything while he was on the pitch. Adeyemi was a significant improvement when he replaced Beier. Sean: 4 Paul: 5 Sean: 4 Gittens had an uncharacteristically quiet game. He almost created an own goal for Hoffenheim in the early moments of the game, though. Paul: 5 Sean: 4 Dreadfully quiet. Paul: 7 Adeyemi was lively when he came on. He was probably trying a little too hard to put the team on his back, but there wasn’t much being offered by anyone else. Sean: 6 At least he looked dangerous at times. Paul: 5 Sean: 5 Paul: 5 Sean: 5 I know Paul and I aren’t saying much in our comments, but it’s tough when virtually nothing happened in the game. Paul: 5 Sean: 5 Paul: 3 I wouldn’t usually rate a player who played less than ten minutes. Unfortunately for Lührs, his short debut was a nightmare after a glaring error that led to Hoffenheim’s goal. Sean: 3 Paul: 4 I suppose Dortmund weren’t abysmal. You could possibly give them credit for not giving up much on the defensive end. The trouble is, barely anything happened in the game, and what did happen favored Hoffenheim more than Dortmund. It could have been a lot worse, and if BVB were in otherwise good form, this sort of game wouldn’t be a big deal, but it’s a continuation of a season of this nonsense. If you’re going to be bad, at least have the good grace to be entertaining about it (like Southampton, for example). Şahin’s BVB are nowhere near the level we expect of this team. They’re not even meeting the minimum expectations. According to xGD/90, they’re the seventh best team in the Bundesliga, and they’re a lot closer to Mainz in 8th than they are to Borussia Mönchengladbach in 6th. Things have got to improve, otherwise BVB will suffer the consequences for more than a single season. Sean: 3 It’s not just that Dortmund barely created any offense, were mostly outplayed by a Hoffenheim flirting with relegation, and bored me to death. They had a 1-0 lead, couldn’t defend it, and did virtually nothing to add an insurance goal. Gambling Problem? Call 1-800-GAMBLER (1-800-426-2537). Hope is here.

The 18-year-old, currently on loan at Heidenheim, is valued at €15m by Transfermarkt, and is regarded as one of the brightest prospects in German football. Die Schwarzgelben have been scouting Wanner for years and were close to signing the German-Austrian in 2021 until Bayern Munich blocked a transfer at the eleventh hour. And now Wanner has come to the attention of Dortmund once again. Per BILD, the attacking-midfielder has been mentioned as BVB’s recruitment team plan their transfer targets ahead of the 2025/26 season. Both Lars Ricken and Sebastian Kehl believe that Wanner has what it takes to play at Champions League level already. Wanner’s Bayern Munich contract runs until 2027 and the Rekordmeister aren’t planning to sell their talent, but although Dortmund wish to sign the playmaker on a permanent basis, a loan deal has been discussed although club bosses are yet to make any concrete approach although Wanner knows of Borussia’s interest. But Dortmund will face competition to sign Wanner. Should Florian Wirtz leave Bayer Leverkusen or Xavi Simons departs RB Leipzig, then the Bundesliga duo, as well as Eintracht Frankfurt and Stuttgart, will target the German youth international.

Promoters A22 have contacted UEFA and FIFA to seek official recognition for its new competition. The new version is called the Unify League and would feature 64 clubs around Europe competing in three divisions. Unlike the European Super League, this version would include promotion and relegation rather than a set number of teams gaining qualification based on past success. It’s unclear how the project would finance itself and exactly who the donors behind the new format are. The exact details remain vague as many football fans around Europe start to wonder if people associated with their club are backing the proposal. A letter addressed to UEFA General Secretary reads: “This behaviour is incompatible with an organisation that must be open, transparent and free from conflicts of interest at all times.” The European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled last December UEFA’s rules to block the Super League were contrary to EU law.

Over the years, countless great young players have donned the beloved black and yellow of Borussia Dortmund. We fans have been treated to jaw-dropping football displays by world-class talents. You already know their names: Erling Haaland, Jadon Sancho, Jude Bellingham, Christian Pulisic, and Ousmane Dembélé, among others. In the last few years, Dortmund’s success at finding and rearing young talent has waned, but even amid a season that is lackluster by this club’s standards, there is currently one young player right now proving week in and week out that he’s worth tuning in to watch him play. Jamie Gittens might not have come to Dortmund with the same heavy accolades as Bellingham or Haaland, and his star may not have risen in such a meteoric fashion, but after several years of showing flashes of potential without putting it all together, his career in Dortmund is finally beginning to take off. First, let’s put in context just how good Jamie Gittens has been this season. He leads Dortmund in combined goals and assists this season, surpassing even Serhou Guirassy and Julian Brandt. He’s benefited from some exceptional finishing, but I would argue that aside from the actual finishing, he is driving play like no other BVB player. In fact, I think you can make the case that Gittens is currently one of, if not the most effective player in the entire Bundesliga with the ball at his feet. Gittens’ pace and dribbling skills have always been his bread and butter. I think few people realize because I didn’t fully comprehend it until I started writing this article, how bonkers pretty much all of his dribbling stats are. Just to get us started, here are the top 10 Bundesliga players in successful take-ons per 90: As you can see, not only is Gittens in a highly elite company, but he’s also the best in the whole league - and it isn’t even all that close. Musiala and Wirtz might be at each other’s throats for second place, but Gittens is leaving them in the dust, with almost one full take-on more per 90 than Musiala, the next highest. If you think that Gittens is just stat-padding by attempting a bonkers amount of take-ons and only leading this category by brute force, his success rate is actually a tick *higher* than Musiala and only a tick lower than Wirtz. So he beats defenders as successfully as these players, but his output is significantly higher. The ability to beat defenders 1-on-1 is vital in breaking down a low block and creating chances. Gittens also leads the Bundesliga in successful take-ons that result in shot attempts, indicating that his take-ons aren’t just going nowhere and are actually producing chances. To further illustrate this, here are the top 10 Bundesliga players in carries into the opponents’ penalty area per 90 minutes: What a shock: Gittens is number one. This one is at least close, with Omar Marmoush putting up a good fight, but it drops off quickly after that. Gittens is not just contributing in the attacking third. Borussia Dortmund have sometimes struggled to progress the ball through the opponents’ press, despite frequently maintaining the lion’s share of possession. Here are the top 10 Bundesliga players in overall progressive carries per 90 minutes. Take a guess who’s number one: In a season in which it can be hard to find bright spots for Borussia Dortmund, Jamie Gittens has been a breath of fresh air and a constant source of excitement. His game is still not fully rounded. He still has the occasional turnover. His expected goal and expected assists per 90 minutes combined are “only” 0.36, which is not bad, but not great. Then again, almost nobody on BVB is doing well by that metric. At the end of the day, Gittens has managed to put up some utterly bonkers numbers while surrounded by a team that has stumbled from week to week in the first half of the season. At times, it has seemed that Gittens has had to take the entire team and put it on his shoulders. His amazing goal against Bayern Munich is proof of this: As poor Konrad Laimer found out, Gittens is one talented kid. If Nuri Sahin can find a way to consistently utilize him successfully, then defenders across Europe will tremble as he gallops down their throats. Gambling Problem?

However, according to local publication Ruhr Nachrichten, Sahin isn't in any danger of losing his job for the time being, as those in charge still believe he can steady the ship. Sahin's relationship with sporting director Sebastian Kehl and managing director for sport Lars Ricken is said to be intact, but he needs to deliver results to keep his job. Dortmund's minimum target for the season is Champions League qualification, but they currently sit eighth in the table, five points behind fourth-placed RB Leipzig. Sahin took over as Borussia Dortmund coach last summer, replacing Edin Terzic."

Unfortunately, you’re reading this it’s the year 2024, not 2019, so that is a bad thing. At least JBL didn’t celebrate his goal, a fitting ending, because there was almost nothing at all to celebrate for either team in Dortmund today. If you were following BVB injury news, or read my match preview, you would have thought that the problem in this game was going to be a ramshackle back-line full of spare parts held together with duct tape. In reality, the back line wasn’t that bad! Nico Schlotterbeck, who wasn’t supposed to return until 2025, turned out to not miss a single minute after his injury against Barcelona. Emre Can played next to him, and Bensebaini and Couto played at full-back. That’s a decent back line, at least on paper. Instead, if there was one absence that was notably felt, it was Julian Brandt. Between Jamie Gittens, Maximilian Beier, and then Karim Adeyemi, Dortmund dominated the wide areas, but consistently struggled to penetrate centrally, once again relying on 1-on-1s from their wide players. Serhou Guirassy received such scant service, and had so many responsibilities dropping deep, that he only managed 31 touches and only 2 in the box in the full 90 minutes. As a whole, BVB mustered one measly shot attempt in the first half, although Hoffenheim did almost concede an own goal, and Serhou Guirassy had a penalty taken away by VAR because he decided to try to win one by diving. Even Dortmund’s goal came somewhat out of nowhere. It wasn’t a total fluke, but it did result from a fortuitous bounce. Gittens looped in a mostly speculative cross that Hoffenheim’s Stanley N’Soki headed right into Gio Reyna, who lashed the ball into the net. It was a great moment for Gio Reyna, but unfortunately BVB couldn’t make it stick. For all of BVB’s offensive struggles, for most of the match Hoffenheim were only slighter better, and sometimes even worse. According to Understat, Hoffenheim did not register a single shot attempt after the 61st minute until their stoppage time equalizer. Unfortunately, Jamie Gittens or Karim Adeyemi couldn’t manufacture a second goal all on their own today, so Hoffenheim stayed in reach, giving them the chance to ultimately equalize. It was an ugly game, so you know they would tie it up with an ugly goal. Valentin Gendry launched a long throw into the box, which Felix Nmecha and Bensebaini failed to clear. The ball looped to the back post, and Dortmund legend Jacob Bruun-Larsen out-muscled another more recent BVB youth product, Yannik Lührs, to the ball. At least he didn’t celebrate!

The 26-year-old - not exactly a stranger to adversity at this stage of his professional career - kept it subdued after notching the 1-1 at 90+1. The former Danish international joined the BVB youth ranks in 2015 and remained with the Westphalian club for five years. “Everyone who knows me knows what this club means to me and my family,” Bruun Larsen noted in the mixed zone last night, ”BVB supported me during a difficult time when I was younger. Dortmund believed in me and signed me to a professional contract when I was injured. [Former] sporting director Michael Zorc even visited me in the hospital. Bruun Larsen didn't react much when teammates Alexander Prass and Stanley approached him to deliver congratulations. In this particular case, Bruun Larsen's emotional reaction was to show as little emotion as possible. The TSG winger went into still further depth when explaining this in his post-match comments. “We did deserve a point,” said Bruun Larsen, but scoring for the first time as an opponent in this stadium is something I'll never forget.”"

Matters certainly went well for the 22-year-old. Reyna scored his first goal in BVB colors since match-day 32 of the 2022/23 campaign. Thanks to plenty of promising work at a young age, Reyna still has 95 German top flight appearances to his credit. The son of former USMNT captain Claudio Reyna and six-times-capped USWNT professional Danielle Egan has scored a total of 18 goals for Dortmund in 105 appearances across all competitions. His tally last night agains highlighted his natural talent. A sublime chest down and fearless finish from about 15 meters out might serve as a profound statement that the former American Dream (recently referred to as U.S. Soccer's lost boy in a New York Times article) is ready to return to the Bundesliga stage. Multiple injuries, a failed loan stint at Nottingham Forest, and verified rumors that his German club wish to offload him could quickly be forgotten if Reyna begins to produce again. Gio can become important for us if he remains fit, BVB trainer Nuri Sahin remarked at his post-match presser last night, [Despite more injuries], he's managed to keep at it, train well and present himself positively. I'm glad he scored today. [The recent loan to the EPL] helped him see the importance of getting playing time here at Dortmund."

It was therefore a huge surprise to see him in the starting line-up for Borussia Dortmund's 1-1 draw with Hoffenheim in the Bundesliga on Sunday. It was an extreme risk, Schlotterbeck admitted in a post-match interview. The physios didn't necessarily give me the green light, but they said there was a possibility I could play, the centre-back added. He ended up playing 90 minutes in what he described as an unbelievably bad game from Dortmund. “That wasn't good enough. We are Borussia Dortmund, and if we can stay up there in the table by beating Hoffenheim at home, then we have to win, he fumed."

In an interview with the German tabloid, the 26-year-old makes it clear that he'd like to play more. Of course you're unhappy when you don't play, especially when I know I have the qualities to help the team, Özcan told Bild. “When you don't play, it always makes you think. That's not the case at the moment. I don't want to look into the future right now.” The fact that Özcan struggles to understand why he doesn't play more doesn't make things any easier. I don't really know myself. I can't explain it to myself. I give it my all in training, the coach knows what qualities I have. At the end of the day, the coach decides, I just have to keep going and stay positive. Then I think I'll get my chance, he said. Özcan has played 361 minutes in 11 appearances for Wolfsburg since joining from Borussia Dortmund last summer."

With just five points separating 4th and 10th, there is plenty to talk about after the fallout of matchday 14 in the Bundesliga. Bayern Munich suffered their first Bundesliga defeat of the season as a Jae-Sung Lee brace secured all three points for Mainz 05. Bayern started the brighter of the two with Micheal Olise having two decent chances in the opening 10 mins, his first effort inside five minutes rattling the post. Mainz got their noses in front as Bayern failed to clear their lines and a wicked deflection fell kindly for Lee who simply couldn’t miss. Mainz’s second, however, was anything but lucky as a beautifully crafted move on the right-hand-side found Lee in the box who cleverly turned his man and smashed the ball home. The move queued wild celebrations from the Mainz faithful including head coach Bo Henriksen who must have thought Christmas had come early. Bayern did pull one back a few minutes from time when the ball fell kindly for Leroy Sané who couldn’t miss but Mainz held on for an impressive victory. Mainz get back to winning ways following defeat to Wolfsburg and are right in the mix for European contention on 22 points in 7th. Bayern will look to bounce back in a huge game against RB Leipzig on matchday 15. Marco Rose had been under a lot of pressure at RB Leipzig in recent weeks but it appears his side have finally turned the corner and are back on track (domestically anyway). Following a winless November, the Saxons have reached the last eight of the DFB Pokal and secured back-to-back Bundesliga wins with their latest victory against Eintracht Frankfurt as Rose’s side ran out 2-1 winners. Leipzig took the lead through Benjamin Šeško who was quickest to react following a smart save from Kevin Trapp – Šeško only had eyes for the lopping ball with the Frankfurt defence perhaps a little disorientated as to where the ball had actually gone – Šeško was left to cushion the ball into the net. What followed was a flurry of chances from both sides including Frankfurt’s Omar Marmoush whose freekick rattled the crossbar and was just inches away from going in. Should that set piece have found the net, it would have been Marmoush’s third consecutive goal from a free kick. Frankfurt did get themselves level through Nathaniel Brown who is having a breakout season to remember. This was just his 7th Bundesliga game and that was his third goal having already assisted twice this campaign. He was teed up beautifully on the left as his shot cannoned against the far post and in. Leipzig got the winner five minutes into the second half when a corner was flicked onto the back post where Loïs Openda was left free to volley the ball into the net. It’s another impressive display from Marco Rose’s men who must love to welcome Frankfurt to the Red Bull Arena. The win puts Leipzig level on points with Frankfurt as they move up into 4th, breathing down the necks of Frankfurt in 3rd. Bayer Leverkusen are back up into second and four points off top spot following a 0-2 victory away at FC Augsburg. That’s now seven consecutive wins in all competitions for Xabi Alonso’s side who appear to have found their form again following a rocky opening to the season. Up next is 5th place SC Freiburg. TSG Hoffenheim scored an injury time equaliser to rescue a point away at Borussia Dortmund. The away side were more deserving of their point as they had the better opportunities and shots at goal. The draw leaves BVB in 8th on 22 points while Hoffenheim are in 14th on 14 points. VfL Bochum played the majority of their match away at Union Berlin with ten men. Despite this, they held on for a point and even took the lead in the 23rd minute. It was completely one-way traffic with constant pressure from Union but Bochum held on for what may not seem like an important point considering they haven’t a game yet but it’s a sign they haven’t given up. After this, you feel their first win is only a matter of time. GGFN | Jamie Allen @2023 - All Rights Reserved. Get Football Group"

No energy on the pitch, no good positioning, a lot of patchwork . The early goal after half-time actually did us good. But it was only good for a few minutes. And then it was just like the first half. Still, you have to concede in the 90th minute if you want to achieve the goal we have.

The expected goal difference between Dortmund (0.58) against Hoffenheim (1.18) says it all. Dortmund simply weren’t good enough today, even with the energy of the yellow wall behind them. Christian Ilzer’s side came to play tonight, and the new Hoffenheim coach showed exactly why Hoffenheim chose him to take over after the dismissal of Pellegrino Matarazzo. The first 45 minutes were very scrappy, with both teams struggling to create chances. Hoffenheim efficiently played out of BVB’s press, and they managed to shut down Felix Nmecha in the midfield, hindering him in progressing the ball as we’ve seen a lot lately. When Gio Reyna fired Dortmund to 1-0 within the first minute of the second half, my spirits were high. Sadly, Gio Reyna’s goal seemed to be just one brilliant moment within 90 minutes of very mediocre football from BVB. Despite Sahin’s team having shown decent performances lately, they never really came out of first gear, and they were finally punished in stoppage time, when former BVB player, Jacob Bruun Larsen, wrestled the young Yannik Lührs off the ball inside the box and slotted the ball past Gregor Kobel. As this draw wasn’t frustrating enough in itself, Yan Couto also had to be subbed off due to injury, which means that there are now barely three first team players at Sahin’s disposal in defense. The winter break can’t really come quick enough at this point. So. Which players were less bad than the others tonight? Below you’ll find my nominees for MOTM. Can’t really get around it. If Gio hadn’t rocketed the ball into the net a handful of seconds into the second half, Dortmund would have dropped all three points at home tonight. Although Gio scored, he also had some very frustrating moments—most notably a sequence when he was played in behind and managed to trip over the ball, resulting in a wasted opportunity. Let’s at least hope that Gio can play himself into some kind of good form, because BVB simply need bodies at the moment. I think Nico Schlotterbeck was once again solid tonight. Strong in clearances and not at fault for the goal scored. He’ll also get a bonus point for not letting Gittens get himself sent off when the young Englishman was severely provoked by Arther Chaves. I don’t know if Schlotterbeck played through some pain tonight, but if he did, it was hard to see. I don’t really think it was that much Nmecha’s fault that he wasn’t able to impose himself on the game as much as one could’ve hoped. Hoffenheim simply knew his importance to this team, and they expertly blocked Dortmund’s passing lanes to the German international. Despite less involvement, I think Nmecha did well when he actually had the ball at his feet. He seemed very tired at the end, but that’s fully understandable given how much he has played lately. Bensebaini honestly did almost everything you could ask of him. The team as a whole just didn’t manage to get up the pitch today, which meant that the Algerian international had to do quite a lot of defending. He won the majority of his duels, and he had some decent crosses from set pieces. Gambling Problem? Call 1-800-GAMBLER (1-800-426-2537). Hope is here.

From a Dortmund perspective, the first half was very underwhelming. They struggled to create any meaningful chance to trouble Oliver Baumann in the Hoffenheim net, in fact, they had just one shot in the entire first half. Dortmund were awarded a penalty after what was originally deemed a foul on Serhou Guirassy from Arthur Chaves, but VAR, rightly, overturned the decision. For Hoffenheim, they also failed to have a shot on target but looked a lot more dangerous than Dortmund especially when they were going forward. However, in the second half, Dortmund started very quickly when Giovanni Reyna scored his first Bundesliga goal in 582 days as he latched onto a poor clear from Hoffenheim. This trend did not last long as Hoffenheim continued to be the better side and Dortmund were unable to create any meaningful chances, shown by the fact they created no big chances in the whole game. Hoffenheim on the other hand continued to push for equalisers and they were rewarded late on when ex-Dortmund Jacob Bruun Larsen prodded home. For Hoffenheim, the result was probably unjust as they would feel like they could have come away with the three points, which goes to show the positive work that Christian Ilzer has done since arriving from Sturm Graz. While Dortmund were not good and lacked any creative spark and were lucky to draw this game. The positive for Dortmund is that on his return from injury, Karim Adeyemi looked lively but he was still unable to make up for the lack of creative spark. Apart from that it is clear that Dortmund need more options in the creativity department as without Julian Brandt and Jamie Gittens not at his best today, Dortmund had nothing.

Liverpool FC could be positioning itself in the mix to land Bayern Munich left-back Alphonso Davies: Liverpool have got what they need in order to accelerate a move for Alphonso Davies. The Canadian is reportedly on the shortlist. The Athletic claims Liverpool are in fact in the mix for Alphonso Davies. The left-back is out of contract in the summer and his destination isn’t as clear as it once was. Everyone assumed that Real Madrid would sign Davies. It appears that’s nowhere near a certainty, however, and Madrid don’t hold the power over the transfer that they once did. And so Liverpool are there, seeing what can happen. The Athletic’s report makes it clear that if Davies were to move to England, Anfield would be the ‘most plausible’ destination. It feels unlikely that Liverpool would be the club that reels in Davies, but weirder things have happened. Anyway, after months of Real Madrid looking like the frontrunner to land Davies, a contract extension with Bayern Munich now looks like the most likely option. Will the Bavarians get a deal done? Related Florian Wirtz appears to be on the cusp of signing a contract extension with Bayer Leverkusen, but if there is one club who might be able to blow away Die Werkself with a massive offer, it could be Manchester City. City is absolutely reeling at the moment under Pep Guardiola and could use a jolt of energy in the summer of 2025. Could Guardiola sway Wirtz to make the jump to England? Let’s see: Christian Falk has reported via his exclusive Daily Briefing column that he believes that Manchester City have every chance of signing Wirtz next summer. Falk believes that Pep Guardiola’s contract extension means that City have a big chance of landing their dream signing. Furthermore, Falk adds that Real Madrid and Bayern Munich are also keen to sign the German international. Lastly, Falk’s report gives the impression that it’s now a battle between three clubs to sign the Bayer Leverkusen star. To win a perceived transfer battle for Florian Wirtz. Manchester City would have to offer something that Bayern Munich or Real Madrid couldn’t. As per Falk’s report, it appears that those are City’s main rivals in the race for the German superstar. Bayern can offer Wirtz the opportunity to play at Germany’s biggest club. There is always an allure to that proposition for Germany’s finest talent. Real Madrid are Real Madrid. Generally, when they target one of the biggest talents, they usually get their man. But not always. Manchester City have one player who spurned Madrid’s advances to play at the Etihad. That is Erling Haaland. The hope is they can convince Wirtz to do the same. But how could they do it? As per Falk’s report playing under Pep Guardiola is an attractive proposition for any player. That is a well-established fact. There is an aura attached to playing under Guardiola. The hope is City can leverage that in any potential negotiations with Wirtz. There is also the offer of the German international leading a new era of dominance at Manchester City. Kevin De Bruyne, Ilkay Gundogan, Bernardo Silva and others are coming towards the end of their storied careers at Manchester City. So there is an opening there for a player like Wirtz to take over. He could possibly be the face of City’s new era alongside Erling Haaland, Phil Foden, Josko Gvardiol and others if he did choose to move to the Etihad next summer. Manchester City do hold their own trump cards in the perceived race for a player who would be their dream signing. If they are faced with a battle against Bayern Munich and Real Madrid for Florian Wirtz they must pull out all of the stops to secure his signature. He is that good and signing him could set up Manchester City’s next era of dominance in England and across Europe. Related This episode of the Bundesliga Rundown will be a special one!

Related Bayern Munich was riding high, but now might go stumbling into the break depending on on how motivated RB Leipzig is to help save the job of its head coach. Obviously, Bayern Munich would rather not be in this predicament, but there is still this final game to right the ship. Aside of the on-field action, there appears to be some serious movement on a couple of transfer situations that could dramatically affect the future of the club. Let’s talk about all of that and more on the latest edition of the Bavarian Podcast Works Show. This is what we have on tap: Support Bavarian Podcast Works on Patreon! Related Real Madrid might miss out on Bayern Munich star Alphonso Davies, but could be willing to take a run at AC Milan left-back Theo Hernández — and might even know the price tag on the left-back: Real Madrid have been strongly linked with Alphonso Davies for much of the last 12 months, and although at one stage it seemed inevitable that he would join as a free agent next summer, it is now more likely that the Canadian defender signs a new contract at Bayern Munich. If that happens, Los Blancos would need to move on. Due to the poor performances of Ferland Mendy this season, it’s likely that Real Madrid will try to sign a new left-back even if Davies does not arrive. One option could be former player Theo Hernandez, whom they have been linked with in the past. As per La Gazzetta dello Sport, AC Milan are willing to sell Hernandez, who is only contracted to the club until 2026. Because of this contract situation, they are willing to accept offers in the region of €50m. Related Marcus Thuram could be courted by the likes of Real Madrid, FC Barcelona, and Liverpool FC: Real Madrid, Barcelona and Liverpool are locked in a three-way scrap for Inter’s Marcus Thuram, who has an €85m (£70m) release clause. When he was at Borussia Mönchengladbach, Thuram was on the radar of Bayern Munich. Related Bayern Munich traveled to Mainz 05 for a Bundesliga showdown against a club that has been somewhat of a surprise in Germany this season.

Should Manuel Neuer get a new contract that ties him to Bayern Munich past 2025? There have been calls for Bayern to let the legendary goalkeeper go due to his declining shot stopping, but the noise from the media indicates that a renewal is on its way. When it comes to handling the departure of a legend such as Manuel Neuer, who is currently in his 13th season at the club since arriving from Schalke 04, a cold and casual release was never going to happen. Instead, head coach Vincent Kompany reveals a different approach to negotiations: “We’re trying to be a little bit like a family,” Kompany says, via @iMiaSanMia. “We always discuss it with the player first. Especially when he’s such a legend who has achieved so much.” One has to wonder how big Kompany’s role in the matter is, considering Christoph Freund and Max Eberl are those in charge of contracts at the club. But he reveals the truth we all should have known: Appreciation for Neuer’s past achievements were always going to come into play. Now the ones in charge need to find the perfect balance between such appreciation and the desire to move forward. Looking to catch up on all of the Bundesliga action from the weekend?

One of Bayern Munich’s primary tasks is to offload high earners, and three of the wingers—Serge Gnabry, Kingsley Coman, and Leroy Sané—fall under this category. Selling even one of those players is easier said than done, but former Bayern player Lothar Matthäus wants to see transfer activity from his old club, especially in that department of the team. He even went as far as declaring that said three players won’t be at the club next year. “There will definitely be some changes in the wing positions,” Matthäus said (Sky90 via Goal). “There are three shaky candidates: Coman, Gnabry and Sané. They will not all three be staying at Bayern next year, even if I’m certainly not going to mention any names now. All three will definitely not stay. At least one will leave, and possibly even two, as new names are also being discussed for these positions in Munich.” Florian Wirtz appears to be out of reach regardless of whether or not he extended his contract with Bayer Leverkusen, which leaves Bayern with few viable options.

No mistakes. Perfect touch. I had never seen anything like it. I was just thinking: Oh my God. If I saw it right now, today, I would still be thinking: Oh my God. It didn’t even make sense. It was a glitch. Thiago is a glitch.” During one of the training sessions, he made it his goal to not show that he was 17, that he was able to keep up with the pros. Fast-forward to end of training, everyone was walking back to their club-sponsored Audis, but Musiala couldn’t drive home: no license or car. What now? “OK, we’re done. Can you come pick me up?” Mrs. Musiala rolls up to pick up her son like it’s his first day of school. The whole ride home he was just smiling like his mum. A lot of things went by in a blur since then: listening to Thomas Müller bark orders in an empty stadium, scoring his first goal (against Schalke in an 8-0 win), playing in a sold-out stadium for the first time, his first ever World Cup, winning Bayern the Bundesliga on the last day of the 2022/23 season, playing in the home Euros wearing the number 10 and Epic German Sax Guy. He’s seen it all, and he’s only 21. Basically, a single camera roll will have all the memories come flooding back. Funny enough, you could say that Musiala’s only getting started, and you’d be right.

Squad planning is certainly on all clubs’ radars at the moment but bigger pieces such as Jamal Musiala and Florian Wirtz need to be addressed at Bayern before these decisions can be made.

The report claims that Wanner's name is coming up more and more frequently in meetings held by the club's management. Wanner and his agent are aware of Dortmund's general interest, but no concrete negotiations have yet taken place. Ideally, Dortmund would like to sign Wanner permanently, but with Bayern currently unwilling to sell, they've discussed the possibility of taking the 18-year-old out on loan, believing he can make an immediate impact, even in the Champions League. Wanner himself would like to be a regular in a Champions League side next year. As he would likely get more playing time at Dortmund than at Bayern, that could argue for a move to Signal Iduna Park. Wanner has scored six goals and provided two assists in 21 appearances for Heidenheim this season."

The 21-year-old’s current deal expires in 2026 and a new deal would see him become the Rekordmeister’s highest-paid player in club history, surpassing Harry Kane and Robert Lewandowski, but fans will have to wait a little longer for a positive update. “There is unfortunately no Christmas present that I can give fans yet,” Musiala told Sport Bild. “There will be no news anytime soon. We have had a lot of games recently, a lot of trips. My focus is on the games. I want to be free on the pitch. Even if you put a lot of pressure on me from the outside, I am relaxed.” When asked what the crucial factors are in a new contract, Musiala added: “There are many things that I pay attention to. For me it is important that I feel comfortable and can have fun on the pitch, that we are competitive and can compete for the title in the Champions League. “In summary, all the factors that contribute to this big decision for me simply have to feel good and right.” Musiala was named Player of the Year for the German men’s national team last week with 56 percent of the vote, ahead of Bayer Leverkusen’s Florian Wirtz who finished second with 38 percent, and Arsenal’s Kai Havertz with just six percent.

There won't be any news in the near future, Musiala told the German publication. He doesn't want to be rushed into a decision and wants to take his time. We've had a lot of games recently, a lot of travelling. My focus is to concentrate on the games. I want to be free on the pitch, even if there's a lot of pressure from outside, said Musiala. “All in all, all the parameters that contribute to this big decision have to feel good and right for me.” Although he hasn't yet signed a new contract yet, Musiala can see himself staying at Bayern for the long term. I would like to leave my mark on an era at FC Bayern. If I extend my contract with FC Bayern, that's my ambition and my goal, said Musiala. “But I also know that you have to work for it, with victories, titles and major trophies.

Paul Wanner’s playstyle is a distinctive, quick, intelligent and nimble one, always thinking 5 steps ahead of the opponent and looking for the most dangerous pass through the opposition defense. Though it is distinctive, however, in the long history of football, it is not quite unique. In fact, there are two players who the Bayern Munich loanee admits particularly influence this style of play: “(Lionel) Messi. He was and is simply the best player. But I would also say Neymar,” Wanner mused, via Sky Sports. “What he did with the ball, his dribbling - that was really great. Especially his time at Barca. I followed him and Messi a lot back then.” The (now former) FC Barcelona duo are not the only influences on his life as a footballer, however. In fact, the former FV Ravensburg youth player comes from a family of footballers: “Well, my father used to play in the second Austrian league. According to what he said, he was pretty good (laughs). I don’t know if that’s true. My grandfather played too, but not as high. But from what I’ve heard, he didn’t do too badly either. Maybe I even learned something from them (laughs).” Though it is up in the air how much the FC Heidenheim player learned from them both, it is clear that his focus on football had to come from somewhere. Did that focus leave any space for a Plan B, if a career in football did not pan out? “No, it was always just about football. I started with football very early. To be honest, I didn’t think about my Plan B. It was just football.” Related Check your inbox for a welcome email. Oops. Something went wrong. Please enter a valid email and try again.

9823,A38714F62D55064399D3F9EC44F3A546,Is the DFB a toxic middle manager? Bayern Munich fined for being two minutes late for Bochum kickoff,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ujj-40JmdSCpgyWYRN3pD6rBK3I=/0x0:3040x1592/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25789009/2180634561.jpg,2024-12-18T00:30:00.000Z,Bavarian Football Works,https://www.bavarianfootballworks.com/2024/12/18/24320715/bayern-munich-vfl-bochum-late-kickoff-dfb-fine-bundesliga-germany-kane-musiala-coman-sane-olise,"Filed under: Apparently, Bayern has received a considerable fine for being just two minutes late for their Bundesliga week 8 match against VfL Bochum. Everyone in their lifetime has had one of those toxic bosses and our middle managers that harps on every little detail in the office. Being one minute late for work, not being back from your lunch break at exactly the designated time, or straying from an already unrealistic project timeline. Most of corporate America has had to put up with that dynamic more time than they would want to admit, but this is apparently something that has affected Bayern Munich a la the DFB from a match against VfL Bochum earlier in the Bundesliga season. Per information from the governing body of German football (Deutscher Fussball Bund), the Rekordmeister had completed their equipment inspection ahead of their Bundesliga match week 8 match at VfL Bochum late (via @iMiaSanMia). The late completion of the equipment inspection led to the match officially kicking off two minutes later than it was supposed to. It kicked off at 10:32AM Eastern Standard Time when it was supposed to have kicked off at 10:30AM. This equated, at the time, to 3:30PM Central European Time or 3:32PM as it was the awkward period that occurs twice per season when North America and Europe are not aligned with their Daylight Savings Time schedules. As a result of the late kickoff, the DFB decided to give Bayern a fine of €20k, which the club did appeal. The club’s appeal, however, was rejected by the DFB and they will have to pay the fine as a result of just two minutes of tardiness tied to that particular kickoff. Bayern proceeded to win that match 5-0 after the ever so slightly delayed kickoff, having five different goal scorers on the afternoon (Michael Olise, Jamal Musiala, Harry Kane, Leroy Sane and Kingsley Coman). For what it’s worth, this is certainly not the first time Bayern has been fined by the DFB and it likely won’t be the last, though two minutes resulting in €20k does seem rather egregious in the grand scheme of things. It is hard to imagine two minutes affecting local public transportation, hospitality, and infrastructure as well as the Bundesliga — but it seems that if you are on time, you’re late, and if you’re early, you’re on time.

A banned substance was found in the player’s ‘A’ sample. The doping sample which gave a positive result was taken at the end of October. The ‘B’ sample is also expected to be opened in the coming days. Tribuna.com have asked for a comment from Mikhail himself and his manager.

Within the span of just two weeks, there have been two more blips on Bayern Munich’s résumé for the season thus far, adding to the disappoint of the Champions League losses to both Aston Villa and Barcelona earlier on. They crashed out of the DFB-Pokal by virtue of a 1- loss to Bayer Leverkusen after Manuel Neuer was sent off in the first half, and more recently, that fell 2-1 at Mainz in the Bundesliga, perhaps really feeling the absence of both Neuer and the injured Harry Kane. Despite the loss to Mainz, Bayern is still four points clear of Leverkusen at the top of the Bundesliga table, and after their 5-1 win over Shakhtar Donetsk in the Champions League in Gelsenkirchen, they are in 10th the table for that competition — just two spots away from automatic qualification to the knockout stages. While it has been far from perfect in Vincent Kompany’s maiden season as manager of the Rekordmeister, there is no reason to panic or call for his removal, which is a sentiment shared by midfielder Joshua Kimmich. Speaking to Bild (via @iMiaSanMia), Kimmich reflected specifically on the Pokal loss to Leverkusen at the beginning of the month and felt that Bayern was perhaps unlucky to have come out on the losing side of that affair. Even with 10 men, Kimmich felt Bayern played quite well. “When we were eliminated against Leverkusen, it wasn’t a game where you would say that everything was bad, but rather that we have a great team and even with 10 players we are significantly better than the supposedly strongest team in Germany,” he ranted. For what it is worth, his point does sort of offer a zoomed-out view of some of Bayern’s draws and losses this season. Arguably, in the losses to Barcelona, Mainz, and perhaps even Villa, they did not play particularly well, but same cannot necessarily be said for the draws to Eintracht Frankfurt, Borussia Dortmund, Bayer Leverkusen, or as Kimmich alluded to, the Pokal loss to Leverkusen. On the surface, results can certainly be taken out of context, but it is rather more the combination of how Bayern played and the result that matters the most. Even for the Mainz loss, without the unlucky deflections for both of Lee Jae-sung’s goals, the result could have gone in Bayern’s favor or even have been a draw. Check your inbox for a welcome email.

The 18-year-old, currently on loan at Heidenheim, is valued at €15m by Transfermarkt, and is regarded as one of the brightest prospects in German football. Die Schwarzgelben have been scouting Wanner for years and were close to signing the German-Austrian in 2021 until Bayern Munich blocked a transfer at the eleventh hour. And now Wanner has come to the attention of Dortmund once again. Per BILD, the attacking-midfielder has been mentioned as BVB’s recruitment team plan their transfer targets ahead of the 2025/26 season. Both Lars Ricken and Sebastian Kehl believe that Wanner has what it takes to play at Champions League level already. Wanner’s Bayern Munich contract runs until 2027 and the Rekordmeister aren’t planning to sell their talent, but although Dortmund wish to sign the playmaker on a permanent basis, a loan deal has been discussed although club bosses are yet to make any concrete approach although Wanner knows of Borussia’s interest. But Dortmund will face competition to sign Wanner. Should Florian Wirtz leave Bayer Leverkusen or Xavi Simons departs RB Leipzig, then the Bundesliga duo, as well as Eintracht Frankfurt and Stuttgart, will target the German youth international.

This comes ahead of a crucial outing for Hansi Flick’s troops this coming weekend. Barcelona are set to play out their final fixture before the Christmas break this coming Saturday, when they welcome Diego Simeone’s Atlético Madrid to Catalunya’s capital for a La Liga clash. The two sides head into the matchup locked on points atop the Spanish top-flight, just a solitary point clear of arch rivals Real Madrid. Barca, for their part, have of course endured a difficult time of things on the domestic front of late, having emerged triumphant from just one of their last six in the league. Atlético, on the other hand, are the form team in Spanish football at this moment. Safe to say, then, that Saturday’s hosts will require all the help they can get in hopes of turning their fortunes around at Montjuïc. Speaking to the media on Tuesday, the aforementioned Joan Laporta therefore made use of the opportunity to send something of a plea to the Blaugrana faithful: “I urge the fans to give the best support they can for the match against Atlético Madrid. It’s absolutely crucial, like every other home match that has that feeling.” Conor Laird – GSFN @2023 - All Rights Reserved. Get Football Group"

Frontman Sørloth, for his part, is fresh off a match-winning performance over the weekend, which saw the summer arrival in Spain’s capital notch the only goal in a La Liga victory over Getafe. This comes amid what has been a solid start to life for the Norwegian in the colours of Atlético. Those of a Rojiblancos persuasion, in turn, may have been concerned to hear that Sørloth was not part of the group of players put through their paces by Diego Simeone on Tuesday. This comes amid ongoing preparations for a top-of-the-table showdown with Barcelona this coming weekend. The Atléti faithful, however, need not fret. As confirmed by Mundo Deportivo: ‘The goalscorer against Getafe received a knock in the last match and the medical services preferred that he train on the sidelines as a precaution.’ Sørloth is expected to be passed fit to face Barcelona on Saturday night.

Both Real Madrid and Barcelona have dropped points, with Barça losing 1-0 to Leganes, and Real Madrid drawing 3-3 with Las Palmas, albeit under controversial circumstances. Meanwhile, Atlético Madrid got a 1-0 win against Getafe, leaving them level on points with Barcelona at the top of the table with a game in hand. The next few weeks could be vital for Diego Simeone’s men, especially given their next match is taking on Barcelona at Montjüic, with the winner going clear at the top of the table. Given the recent news of Lamine Yamal’s injury, Barcelona will be in a tough spot as they play without a player who has truly transformed the way they play. The other point to keep in mind is the standing of Real Madrid, who are just one point back and also have a game in hand against bottom of the table Valencia. With the recent return of Robin Le Normand Atleti have overcome all their injuries, leaving them a clear run to try and stake their claim for the La Liga crown, all they have to do is go out there and perform.

It’s some change from the side who struggled to fourth last season, and it’s clear what the difference is: strength in depth. Atlético Madrid have scored more goals from the bench than any other team in Europe’s top five leagues with 10 goals scored, ahead of nine for Lazio and eight for Bayern Munich. Alexander Sørloth showed it again by scoring the winner against Getafe off the bench. At the other end, too, Atleti were able to draw against Getafe because of a pinpoint cross from Nahuel Molina, a second-choice option at right-back who came off the bench and influenced the game. Elsewhere, Robin Le Normand came on for the final few minutes. That’s some upgrade on the likes of Gabriel Paulista as the reserve option last season. In part, it’s down to the strength of the squad in terms of fitness. Luis Piñedo has made a real impact in driving the fitness of the squad, but also of avoiding injuries. Atleti have had less than half of the number of injuries they had last season, and many of those have been impact injuries, like the one which sidelined Le Normand for two, nearly three, months. Not only has there been an upgrade in the quality of players in the squad, but the more used players are available more often as well. At this point last season (July-December), Atlético Madrid have suffered 20 injuries. This season, they have only suffered 8.@atletico_stats_ pic.twitter.com/nSjnhruKhS Diego Simeone underlined the fact himself in his post-match press conference, reflecting that, “we have repeated the formation several times and there are players who are competing in an extraordinary way, showing what they can do when it’s their turn to come on. Let Llorente and Giuliano come off and Nahuel and Correa come on. Bring on Sorloth for Lino. Let Koke come in. That’s our strength. To compete the way we want to, we have to do it that way”. In 2023/24, only five players (Antoine Griezmann, Álvaro Morata, Ángel Correa, Samuel Lino and Memphis Depay) scored seven goals or more, and 14 different players scored over the course of the season. Already this season Atleti have three (Julián Álvarez, Antoine Griezmann and Alexander Sørloth), and two more are on track to hit that number in the coming weeks and with 13 total goalscorers. That’s without commenting on the case of Samuel Lino, the man who scored eight goals last season and is on only one this year, despite averaging more xG per 90. Much of that comes from some of Atleti’s super subs. Julián Álvarez, who himself grabbed his first goal off the bench, and Antoine Griezmann have established themselves as first choice in attack. Yet all of Ángel Correa’s five goals and two of his three assists have come off the bench, while Alexander Sørloth has got four goals and one assist after coming in. It’s not just goalscorers who are making the difference to Atleti this season, but having reliable and consistent goal-getters coming into the game has been pivotal. The bench has been crucial to getting points after going behind. Draws against Villarreal, Real Madrid and Rayo Vallecano, and wins against Paris Saint-Germain, Leganés, Alavés and Sevilla, have all seen the opposition take the lead and Atleti come back to claw 12 points in La Liga and three in the Champions League. Goals are like ketchup Yeah Sorloth is going on a scoring streak in our upcoming games be aware.pic.twitter.com/AHQSrhGVav For the first time since the international break in mid-November, Atlético now have a full seven-day rest period to prepare for their next fixture, the headline clash with FC Barcelona at the Estadio Olimpico Luis Companys next Sunday. In doing so, it ends a period where Atleti have rarely had more than 72 hours between fixtures for over a month. Diego Simeone exploded after the Champions League win over Slovan Bratislava, saying, “everyone needs to have rest and not play so tight. I’m just saying that because we played on Thursday, on Sunday at 9 p.m. when we had the Champions League and now on Wednesday and then on Sunday at 2 p.m. when we could play at night. But nobody cares.” But could there also be an argument that such momentum has helped Atlético? It’s allowed Simeone to rotate his key players and rest them, distributing his minutes throughout the squad and keeping his squad options satisfied. Given the low number of injuries with Luis Piñedo as fitness coach, and the team’s impressive record of late goals, tiredness hasn’t hit in yet either. A seven-day break seems a blessing, but it could be of more benefit for Barcelona than it is for Atleti. Gambling Problem? Call 1-800-GAMBLER (1-800-426-2537). Hope is here.

Defender Lenglet of course sealed a fresh departure from Catalunya’s capital this past summer. Deemed surplus to requirements by Hansi Flick and co, the Frenchman went on to pen terms with the aforementioned Atlético, on loan for the duration of the campaign. And, in the time since, Lenglet has gone on to rebuild his reputation in impressive fashion. After a shaky start to life in Spain’s capital, hampered by fitness problems, recent weeks have seen the 29-year-old establish himself as an important figure in Diego Simeone’s backline. All told, Lenglet has been afforded 12 starts across all competitions, chipping in with a pair of goals along the way. And this run of appearances on the part of the one-time Sevilla man is expected to continue next weekend, against his parent club.

We worked well defensively and we were solid in attack. When you win 4-3, you have to check a lot of things in defence. In the 1-0 win, both the defensive and offensive work is very valuable,” he explained. “It’s not that I always like to win 1-0; of course I would like, like everyone else, to get better results, but that score has a great significance,” he continued, reinforcing his positivity after the hard-fought three points were secured at the Estadio Riyadh Air Metropolitano. “Before the game, I spoke to the players. I recognised the guys who were not in the line-up. We have repeated the formation several times and there are players who are competing in an extraordinary way, showing what they can do when it’s their turn to come on. Let Llorente and Giuliano come off and Nahuel and Correa come on. Bring on Sorloth for Lino. Let Koke come in. That’s our strength. To compete the way we want to, we have to do it that way. César is less involved; Conor didn’t play, but he’s been doing a great job. That’s the strongest point we have.” “That’s what we need from him. He’s helping us the way he’s helping us, he’s getting involved. We repeated in other games that he had had chances. When you have them, the goals come. It’s a great goal, possibly the most difficult of the last few chances he had. The cross was extraordinary and the header was perfect. It unblocked a match that, as always happens with Getafe, is not easy.” “We have to take it one game at a time. There is no other way. You have to work with humility, try to keep improving, rest and face the match against Barça.” “I always say that, although the focus is on those who are in the line-up, one imagines different situations and possible responses to what can happen. We have those answers, but they depend on commitment. It’s not easy to do that, although it’s nice to say. But it shows when you execute, and we see it. When someone comes in, they give their all, and I’m proud of that.” “I’m representing what I feel. The players know that, I have no commitment to anyone. This is reflected in Koke, a very important man in our journey, who knows that if we need him for 20 minutes, he comes in and he’s a great player in those 20 minutes. That excites me.” Related “I don’t know how you think we’ll approach the game. In the end what will tell if it’s good or bad is the result.” “I am repetitive, boring. I’m not going to change. Until the day I leave, it will be game by game. If we get out of that approach, there is no light.” “That’s a complex question. I always feel that the guys want to give their best, but there are times when it shows and times when it doesn’t. Last year we couldn’t achieve what we wanted to achieve. Last year we couldn’t achieve what we were looking for, and today, fortunately, you can see it in the results.” Gambling Problem? Call 1-800-GAMBLER (1-800-426-2537). Hope is here.

9906,8B70A23AF38DFA5EA5629ECACB47C404,Atlético Madrid star sets La Liga benchmark to guide Diego Simeone’s side level with Barcelona,https://getfootballnewsspain.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/atletico-de-madrid-v-getafe-cf-la-liga-ea-sports-1024x684.jpg,2024-12-15T17:10:00.000Z,Get Spanish Football News,https://getfootballnewsspain.com/atletico-madrid-star-sets-la-liga-benchmark-to-guide-diego-simeones-side-level-with-barcelona/,"A remarkable statistic, highlighting the ongoing excellence of Atlético Madrid star Alexander Sørloth in front of goal has on Sunday come to the fore online. This comes fresh off another outing to remember for the summer arrival in Spain’s capital. Atlético marked their return to action a short time ago, welcoming Getafe to the Wanda Metropolitano for a La Liga clash. When all was said and done, the hosts emerged on the right side of the result, to make it 11 successive victories across all competitions. And it was the aforementioned Sørloth who proved himself match-winner. Midway through the 2nd-half, Nahuel Molina’s pinpoint delivery from the right was nodded home in superb fashion by the towering centre-forward. And, as alluded to above, collective significance in guiding Atléti joint-top of the La Liga table aside, Sørloth’s exploits have since given rise to a head-turning individual statistic. As revealed by StatMuse: ‘Alexander Sørloth is the first player to score 30 non-penalty goals since the start of last LaLiga season.’ Alexander Sørloth is the first player to score 30 non-penalty goals since the start of last LaLiga season. pic.twitter.com/DxhPbglg7I Conor Laird – GSFN @2023 - All Rights Reserved.

For the first time since 2012, Atlético Madrid have posted 11 consecutive wins in all competitions, thanks to a painful 1-0 win against a physical Getafe CF at the Estadio Metropolitano. In a performance light-years from recent matches, a fatigued Atleti bumbled their way through the first half, although unlucky not to be in front after 45 minutes. After a slight tinker in formation and a few fresh legs, Los Colchoneros were able to find the goal on 69 minutes when two of the substitutes combined to produce a moment of the highest quality. Otro salmón para el noruego. liquida al Getafe.#LALIGAEASPORTS #LaCasaDelFútbol pic.twitter.com/6wZIuwmTlm A quickly-taken free kick was worked out to the right flank where Nahuel Molina, out of favour recently, delivered a pinpoint cross to the head of Alexander Sørloth. The Norwegian wrong-footed Getafe goalkeeper David Soria with a propelled header into the far corner which sent the 60,000 largely Santa hat-wearing fans into a frenzy. Here are Into the Calderón's three key takeaways from the match. When Koke stood on the sidelines waiting to enter the pitch on 63 minutes, the vast majority of fans watching probably thought the number 8 of Pablo Barrios would appear in red on the fourth official's electronic board. Instead it was Antoine Griezmann's number that flashed up, prompting surprised reactions — not least from the commentators on ESPN+. Coaches whose players have scored the most goals as substitutes in the history of LaLiga:146 - Diego Simeone119 - Luis Aragones116 - Pellegrini111 - Irureta@pedritonumeros pic.twitter.com/8QAlIlqbJL It turned out, as it often does, to be the right call. Griezmann looked tired and contributed in part to the 77 losses of possession from the team in the first half. Put back into a midfield three for the start of the second half, the Frenchman lacked his usual crisp touch and found it hard to get a hold on the game against a physical opponent. Captain Koke restored a balance to the center of the pitch, and it was his quick thinking that sparked the goal. That goal was a product of two more substitutes. Although with nine big chances missed to his name in this season's LaLiga, Sørloth's goal came from an xG of just 0.04 - his seventh of the campaign. That slim chance at goal was a result of an excellent cross from Nahuel Molina, who made his first appearance since November 10th, replacing Marcos Llorente on 56 minutes. Atleti once more showed the depth of players at their disposal, but with a manager that knows who, where and when to apply them. For the second consecutive game, Samu Lino started on the left of the midfield four, due largely to his impressive input against Sevilla. However, the Brazilian, currently with four fewer goal contributions compared to this time last year, spurred two great chances in the first half resulting in his departure from the game. Julián Alvarez then undertook the job of occupying the left flank in part, although the width was applied more through Javi Galán. Related In matches before Lino's return, it had been Conor Gallagher playing the early days Koke role of being a central midfielder deployed out on the wing. In the return to a 4-4-2 formation, it's the only position where Atleti seem to be lacking an adequate player. Or an in-form one, at least. Rodrigo Riquelme also finds himself in a bad moment, which has seen his playing time reduced as well. This season, Atleti at home can be defined by a single stat. In the first half, they have managed to score four goals in nine matches. In the second half of those games, they have scored triple the amount. Primeras partes nunca fueron buenas en el Metropolitano. O al menos en LaLiga 24/25...↪️4 goles del 0 al 45'↩️14 goles del 45' al 90'+Tocará tirar deL segundo tiempo una vez más. pic.twitter.com/ltu36hkCsJ We have seen how away from home, Simeone's men have been able to draw up high-scoring wins once that early goal goes in. However, at home, a lack of urgency to take the lead presides. Fortunately, Simeone’s aggressive changes and willingness to use his entire squad have made the difference after halftime. Los Rojiblancos have been Spain's late show, snatching victory so often after the 75th minute. But should they challenge for trophies, and want to have a squad fit enough to do so, they must assert more authority at home - especially against teams such as Getafe. Gambling Problem?

Starting XI: Oblak Had an easy day on the job, as Getafe were unable to challenge the keeper. Passed the ball with confidence despite some pressing from the opposition. 5 Llorente Although the Spaniard was unable to burst forward like he usually does, Llorente was a consistent option out wide and underlapping with Giuliano Simeone’s runs. He tracked back to deny the opponent the endline. 5.5 Giménez Combative as ever, pressuring quickly to the ball whenever Getafe looked to slice a pass through the middle. He made six clearances and five recoveries while committing three fouls in a battling display. 6.5 Lenglet Cleaned up any loose balls that the defense was able to win back. His five clearances, three tackles, and two blocked shots were important to nullifying Getafe’s attacks. 7 Galán Pushed forward to contribute overlapping runs out wide and the occasional cross into the box. His movement dragged away defenders and opened lanes for other attackers to exploit. At the back, Galán put in a whopping eight total tackles (winning five) while winning 15 of his 18 ground duels. 7.5 Giuliano Simeone Created half-chances for Samuel Lino in the 13th minute and Rodrigo de Paul in the 30th minute, had a header of his own blast wide before halftime. Was taken off for Ángel Correa in an attempt to bolster the attack. 6.5 De Paul Lofted multiple passes into the final third to produce some promising opportunities. In the second half, the midfielder’s pass out wide to Nahuel Molina led to Alexander Sørloth’s finish. 6.5 Barrios Kept most of his passes simple, helping Atlético Madrid maintain possession. When the opportunity arose, Barrios pushed forward himself in search for a shot on net. 5 Lino Found himself at the end of two chances in the opening 20 minutes, but sent both of his shots rolling wide of the net. The Brazilian was taken off for Sørloth at halftime. 4.5 Alvarez Had his first half-chance at the edge of the box saved comfortably by David Soria. Continued to be an option in the buildup play, but was unable to find a shot on goal for the rest of the match. 5 Griezmann Put in well-placed crosses both in open play and from the corner flag, but was missing an attacker who could rise past Getafe’s stubborn backline. Was subbed off for Koke in the second half to help stabilize the midfield. 5 Subs: Sørloth Scored the winning goal with a nice header into the bottom corner on 69 minutes. The striker’s height and physicality were exactly what the team needed to break the deadlock. 7.5 Correa Won space forward with his dribbling but was unable to find a convincing chance on goal. Picked up a yellow card for arguing with the referee. 4.5 Molina Came on for Marcos Llorente in the 56th minute. Assisted Sørloth’s goal with a cross from the right-hand side, his first goal contribution since Nov. 3. 7 Koke After coming on for Antoine Griezmann, the captain looked to maintain some control in what was becoming a chaotic match. Koke was able to add some fresh legs and control over the tempo but he picked up a late yellow card for a tackle on Luis Milla. 4.5 Le Normand The defender replaced Pablo Barrios in the 86th minute. It was good to see the Frenchman get some minutes after his head injury earlier in the season. N/A Gambling Problem? Call 1-800-GAMBLER (1-800-426-2537). Hope is here.

After defeating Slovan Bratislava on Wednesday, Atlético Madrid (10-5-1, 35 points) have equaled its longest winning streak since October 2013. This run of 10 successive victories has seen Los Colchoneros all but secure a Champions League play-off place and vault into LaLiga’s three-way title race with FC Barcelona and Real Madrid. With another win on Sunday, Atlético will inch closer to its best-ever winning run under Diego Simeone — a stretch of 13 consecutive victories between August and October 2012. Under José Bordalás’ management, Getafe (3-7-6, 16 points) have been as stingy as ever — only 24 total goals have been scored across Los Azulones’ 16 games in LaLiga. Getafe have yet to win away from its Coliseum this season, a drought that began in April; in addition, Geta have an awful 0-4-19 record in league fixtures against Simeone’s Atlético over the past 12 years. Bordalás cannot count on his star midfielder Mauro Arambarri for Sunday’s game, either, as the Uruguayan will be unavailable through suspension. “We have to play a perfect match,” Bordalás told reporters on Saturday. “Atlético have one of the most competitive squads in the competition, they can fight for any and every title. It’s going to be difficult, but we’re confident of playing well.” Simeone was coy Saturday on the potential for rotation against Getafe; he did not train a possible 11 during Saturday’s fog-blanketed training session. Given the coach’s recent complaints about the calendar and the little rest that his players have been afforded, a few changes seem likely for Getafe’s visit, starting with Nahuel Molina entering the side in place of Marcos Llorente. Molina has not played for his club in nearly a month due to injury, not to mention Llorente’s excellent form of late. ⚽️ Tremenda, la niebla que hay hoy en el entrenamiento del #Atleti.

Sin lesiones. pic.twitter.com/MbUCKh5qzc Ángel Correa did not play a part in Wednesday’s 3-1 win over Slovan and should have some role to play against Getafe, but El Cholo will be loathe to break up the Antoine Griezmann - Julián Alvarez duo in attack. Since Oct. 31, the Griezmann-Alvarez partnership has been Europe’s most lethal, with 15 goals scored between them; that is two more than Barcelona’s Raphinha-Robert Lewandowski duo, and four more than Real Madrid’s Vinícius Júnior-Jude Bellingham pair and Bayern Munich’s star attackers Harry Kane and Jamal Musiala. ¡Los convocados para el #AtletiGetafe! pic.twitter.com/WEcxRo9RTS Date Dec. 15, 2024 Location Riyadh Air Metropolitano, Madrid Kickoff time 2:00 p.m. CEST, 1:00 p.m. GMT, 8:00 a.m. ET, 5:00 a.m. PT Available TV/streaming ESPN+ (United States), Movistar+ (Spain) Gambling Problem?

I always expect more from him, just as he expects more from me and I hope he continues in the same way.” “Little by little they have been growing from the connection, the understanding, every day they progress in that partnership that is being generated and when Correa or Sorloth come on, the team is fed with other characteristics. We need everyone. We have four very important strikers, we need the best from each one of them and we need them to play at all times.” “Robin is an extraordinary defender, coming from a serious injury where his teammates (have been) competing in the best way. He is noble and works to have the opportunity to help. He is very strong in his temperament. It will be his turn. We need everyone. Especially from a player like him, who is one of the most important defenders we have.” “He’s an important player in the squad, possibly the one we’ve been talking about the most during this time. We need all the ability he has, between his speed, striking, work, humility, effort to work within the team. He will have to live with what football and society has, which is criticism. In my opinion it will make him stronger and the people around him will help him every day.” Related “I’ve always seen them as a very competitive team that has a clear idea of how to play. The coach’s imprint has allowed them to be where they are and we can’t imagine a match (other than one) with difficulties, competitive in the game on the pitch. They play in a specific way and do it well. They have a coach with very clear ideas.” “We’re analysing what’s best for tomorrow’s game and we’ll see what we’ll do.” “The only way to take care of things is to generate work, humility and commitment. From that and in that game a lot of things can happen.” Gambling Problem? Call 1-800-GAMBLER (1-800-426-2537). Hope is here. GamblingHelpLineMA.org or call (800) 327-5050 for 24/7 support (MA).

A new report in Marca states that Atlético Madrid are not contemplating the loan or sale of Rodrigo Riquelme, despite the player’s struggle for minutes and his poor form — which has prompted unfortunate abuse on social media. The Madrid daily reports that Atlético continue to consider Riquelme, 24, a “foundational player” for the future, even though his 629 minutes are the third-fewest among the squad’s outfield players. Riquelme’s humility has made him popular in the dressing room, and he continues to “dream” of succeeding at Atleti — the “club of his life”, which he joined in 2010 after spells in Zaragoza and Rayo Vallecano’s youth teams. JUST IN: Rodrigo Riquelme is UNTOUCHABLE.The club has no plans to let him go and believes he should be one of the club’s foundational players for the future.Despite the abuse he’s been receiving recently, he still dreams of succeeding at the club of his life, Atlético… pic.twitter.com/VVbl1qh0wu Riquelme convinced Diego Simeone of his qualities following productive loan spells at Mirandés (2021/22) and Girona (2022/23) — fearless dribbling, strong ball-carrying, and an eye for goal. His first season in the Atlético first team was solid: he started 17 of his 34 appearances in LaLiga, with a return of 3 goals and 5 assists across 1,528 minutes, often while playing as a left wing-back. But Riquelme was not a natural at the position, and as Atlético have switched formations from the 3-5-2 back to the 4-4-2, Roro has found himself on the fringes of the first team — only Thomas Lemar and César Azpilicueta have played less, mainly due to extended injury absences. Riquelme this season has yet to score or assist a goal across 16 appearances in all competitions. He has played only 404 minutes in LaLiga and has been an unused substitute six times already; Simeone has tried him again at wing-back, in addition to playing him as a winger either side of a central midfield pair, but he has not found a home at any one position. Making matters worse for Riquelme is the fact that Samuel Lino, his main competition for minutes, is finding form after his own slow start to 2024/25. Lino has one goal (an absolute belter against Sevilla) and three assists from his past five games. ❤️ pic.twitter.com/kA1A4aeEop Personally — and I have been proven wrong before — I would hardly call Riquelme a pillar for the future, and (if accurate) the club’s strong stance over the player is a bit befuddling. There is no doubt that Roro is a talented player with room yet to grow, but in his case, his versatility is a curse rather than a blessing; he lacks the composure and decision-making to play the game at its highest levels; and he turns 25 in four months, rendering it an open question as to how much more there really is to his game. He was linked with a move to Roma over the summer, as well as a potential return to Girona; one wonders if the smart choice may have been to sell high, for €20 million or so, and call it a day. Still, there are underlying metrics in Riquelme’s favor as he fights his way back into contention for minutes. He leads all Atlético players in shot-creating actions per 90 minutes (4.22), progressive carries per 90 (7.78), carries into the final third (4), and carries into the penalty area (1.78). However, he is possibly the team’s worst dribbler given volume (4 attempts/90) and success rate (0.89 per 90, around 22 percent) — and despite being an aggressive shooter (2.45 attempts p90), his shot selection is poor, leaving him with a low 0.15 xG/90 mark.

This of course comes fresh off victories for both sides on the continent this week. When it comes to the former, Real Madrid battled their way beyond Atalanta on Tuesday night, courtesy of goals on the part of all of Kylian Mbappé, Vinícius Jr. and Jude Bellingham. It is one of Los Blancos’ star performers at the other end, though, who has been voted into the TOTW, in the form of Antonio Rüdiger. Turning attentions towards Atlético Madrid, Diego Simeone’s troops secured an altogether more comfortable victory than their capital rivals on Wednesday, putting Slovan Bratislava to the sword by three goals to one. Antoine Griezmann proved himself the star of the show on the evening, notching a brace for the 2nd game in succession.

From here, though, it was the aformentioned Griezmann who stole the headlines, notching a brace for the 2nd game in succession to take the Rojiblancos’ win streak to a hefty 10 games across all competitions. As alluded to above, though, the 33-year-old’s latest exploits in front of goal did not only prove significant from a collective standpoint.

According to Sky correspondent Peppe Di Stefano, Musah has been added to the long list of unavailable players for Milan. The midfielder has not recovered and will miss both the match against Verona on Friday 20 December and the match before New Year’s Eve against Roma at San Siro. The other unavailable players for the game at the Stadio Bentegodi are Noah Okafor, Ismael Bennacer, Luka Jovic, Ruben Loftus Cheek and Christian Pulisic. The last three have some hope of recovering for the match against Roma which closes 2024. It leaves Fonseca short of forward options for the final two games of the year, and he will hope to have some attacking depth back for the Supercoppa in Saudi Arabia at the beginning of the new year. What it also means is that Mattia Liberali could be given another chance as the attacking midfielder, having made his first Serie A start during the 0-0 draw with Genoa at the weekend. Meanwhile, the directors Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Geoffrey Moncada were also present today at Milanello, where Tijjani Reijnders was given his award as the best player in Serie A for the month of November.

Milan have found themselves in the position whereby Youssouf Fofana and Tijjani Reijnders are the starting pair in the double pivot but there are no natural alternatives. Yunus Musah and Ruben Loftus-Cheek are both injured but have been used further forward, while Ismael Bennacer has not yet recovered, leading the Frenchman and Dutchman to work overtime. According to Calciomercato.com, Frendrup is on Milan’s wish list an has a future that is ‘yet to be written’. The Genoa star is proving himself to be a very capable defensive midfielder, with the intensity of a Premier League player.

As La Gazzetta dello Sport recall, on Sunday night Jimenez showed that he was capable of playing a leading role in the senior team, and in his first Serie A start. On a dark and grey night marred by protests at full-time, he managed to scoop the plaudits of many. Those who see him every day in training assure that he is well above the level of the third tier, which is of course the level Milan Futuro play at. In his debut for the season in the Coppa Italia Serie C against Lecco he scored twice, then in November he scored two goals after runs like Theo Hernandez. Those who know him have compared him to Theo since he arrived at Milanello. His technique, physical strength and a propensity for assists and goals mean that in many ways it is natural. Another important point: can seem a bit cocky at times, backing their own ability. One remains the holder of the starting spot, the other an assistant who looks at him and tries to absorb like a sponge. Theo took him under his wing in the locker room, because he speaks Spanish, he has a past at Real Madrid and they play the same role.

Stefano Pioli used Jimenez a few times last season, also on the right side which shows his adaptability, given he is naturally right-footed. Fonseca though seems to prefer him on the left. In the summer he chose to stay at Milan, also convinced by the words of Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who in the press conference to present the season had guaranteed that he would be the deputy to Theo, something Fonseca initially did not agree to. Milan bought him from Real Madrid in July for around €5m after a season on loan, but Los Blancos maintain a buy-back that can be exercised in 2025 or 2026 (for a higher figure). They are monitoring his development naturally, aware of having let Theo go. There have also been enquires both from Italian and Spanish clubs about taking the 19-year-old on loan in January, and in the meantime Alex is warming up for another start against Verona. seems like jimenez solves our right back problem. play him on the right and theo on the left. theo will redisover his form and when he does this duo will be deadly. Yep agreed,but our mighty fonseca will never change emerson royal Is true, because he was the one that requested for him, so he will continue using him if not the management will ask questions of why did he allow Kalulu to go & makes them to buy Emerson if he is not going to use him. Nawao for this your Fonseca I beg Theo used to play like Jimenez when he was actually hungry to prove something at Milan. Jimenez should play as RB. Even in his current form, Theo is better than Emerson on the RT. Your email address will not be published.

According to a report by Daniele Longo, Theo Hernandez is reflecting on his future at Milan as he is not happy with the situation that Paulo Fonseca has put him in. The Portuguese manager benched an out-of-form Rafael Leao at the start of the new season for a few games while laying out his expectations from the player and the forward got back into form with time. While Fonseca has been trying to use a similar therapy programme with the Frenchman, it has not progressed so far as starting on the bench regularly is not something boding well with him. Hernandez feels that he is not getting support from the club and the fans as his bad patch is getting more attention than his achievements with the team. Fonseca is set to bench him again at the Bentegodi this weekend to give way to Alex Jimenez and things are expected to escalate between the two. Contract renewal negotiations which were progressing quicker than predicted have stalled now as Hernandez continues to consider his future. Trambak Bhattacherjee | GIFN @2024 - All Rights Reserved.

8564,8E8E0613343445244062F87A9D7EBBBD,GdS: Morata and Abraham dry – Milan’s striker problem compared to rivals,https://icdn.sempremilan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ac-milan-v-lecce-serie-a-31.jpg,2024-12-18T13:30:00.000Z,Sempre Milan,https://sempremilan.com/morata-abraham-dry-milan-striker-problem,"After failing to score in three of their last four home league games some concerns have arisen about AC Milan’s attack, more specifically the strikers. As La Gazzetta dello Sport (seen below) recall, Milan had 22 shots against Genoa and they failed to score even once. Morata had two big chances: with the first he missed the top corner and with the second – from just a few yards out – he rattled the crossbar. It feels as though there is a reliance on Rafael Leao while Samuel Chukwueze is too predictable, meaning Milan miss Christian Pulisic. Captain America guarantees quality and work rate: he has five goals in the league so far, enough to make him the Rossoneri’s top scorer. Being the top scorer is a task that usually falls to centre-forwards and Milan have two experienced ones in Morata and Abraham. The pair made their debut in the derby together with the Spaniard playing behind the Englishman. It was a success due to unpredictability, but has not really been repeated since because Fonseca prefers a natural attacking midfielder to play behind the striker. The issue, though, is that the two No.9s are far from prolific. Abraham has scored twice in Serie A so far: a penalty in the 4-0 against Venezia and the 3-2 goal against Cagliari. He has netted goals against Slovan and Red Star in the Champions League, marking a recent resurgence. Morata scored at Real Madrid, while in the league his goals came against Torino, Atalanta, Lecce and Empoli. Only against the last two did Milan win. Alvaro has never been a 20-goal-per-season scorer, goals that on some evenings Fonseca struggles to find elsewhere. The comparison with the other forward duos in the league makes for grim reading, given that Abraham and Morata have six goals combined. Atalanta have 20 goals from Lookman-Retegui, Thuram-Lautaro have scored 15 for Inter, Lukaku-Kvaratskhelia have 11 for Napoli, while Vlahovic-Weah even have 11 for Juventus. Ranking of the scorers will be mirrored to final team standings – so we will be 5th at best! This article makes unfair comparisons. How can you compare Abraham and Morata, who typically rotate with each other to duos who regularly play together? I’d assume that playing regularly increases the chances of scoring. What management do is not reinforcing the squad but “supergluing” it. Find someone who “could be” good for Milan, expect European revenue money and thats it. We can be thankful for Clownseca who is going to fuk that logic and everything at all. Your email address will not be published.

As Tuttosport (via MilanPress) reports this morning, straw that broke the camel’s back was the draw against Genoa on Sunday night. The Milan fans have been discontented for some time beyond that but chose to stay supportive towards the team. What has happened in the last few days though has created a real rift between the Curva and the ownership/management. The protest began at the end of the match and continued when the team arrived for the 125th anniversary dinner. It is not likely to subside after that, as per the paper. The relationship between Gerry Cardinale and the Rossoneri fans is at an all-time low. The management, who were booed even before the match, are not exempt from this hostile climate either. The banners and chants are born from disillusionment with the current project on and off the pitch. It is not just a question of results either, but also the high price of tickets reported by the Italian Milan Club Association (AIMC). The images of these days have gone around the world and have also reached the USA. Both in Verona in the away section and on 29 December at San Siro against Roma, the real thermometer of the situation will be seen. F@ck off RedTurd sad part its so easy to run a football club. hire competent people to do their job. don’t fire the most respected man in the history of the sport (who’s done an amazing job no less). i emailed jerry this a while back (he didnt respond) the treatment of Maldini is shameful. Sometimes it seems fans of other clubs respect/love him more than some of our own fans do……unacceptable. Protest in Milan and a protest in front of his office in New York would be nice to see. Show him he is only the custodian of our club and his time is up. Sempre Noi. #cardinaleout This is what people who have no life whatsoever do. People who do nothing, accomplish nothing, have nothing of any significance or purpose at all in their life and their entire life revolves around “supporting” a football club. Get a life Curva. ^Jerry letting us know how he really feels on his burner account 🤣🤣🤣 If that is your attitude towards supporting a football club what the hell does that tell about you daily commenting here on SempreMilan then ? don’t waste your time answering it as it was a rhetorical question.

Today’s edition of La Gazzetta dello Sport (seen below) speaks about the possibility of Alex Jimenez and Francesco Camarda getting their second Serie A starts on Friday at the Stadio Bentegodi. However, other young players also sat on the bench in the Genoa game such as Lorenzo Torriani, Davide Bartesaghi and Silvano Vos. The first two have already made their debut with the senior side, the Dutchman has not and is considered one of the most ready. He was born in 2005 and had already made 13 appearances in the league for Ajax and three in the Europa League before his summer switch to Milan. He is considered a flexible and versatile midfielder with great talent and potential. Fonseca wants to be the coach who will first try to implement players like Vos, who was previously branded ‘too good’ for Serie C. In the meantime it seems as though Rafael Leao has already taken the teenager under his wing. In an Instagram story the Portuguese posed with Vos, calling him ‘brother’. With Yunus Musah and Ruben Loftus-Cheek injured, Youssouf Fofana one yellow away from suspension and Ismael Bennacer not back yet, his chance might come. I think Vos would probably have seen the pitch against Genoa if it hadn’t been for the forced subs during that match. I’d almost forgotten about him. Your email address will not be published.

La Gazzetta dello Sport suggested recently that Tonali is not happy with being a back-up at Newcastle and is already thinking about coming back to Serie A, with Milan naturally mentioned as a potential destination. Magpies’ boss Eddie Howe replied to the reports in a press conference this week and laughed them off, while Matteo Moretto of Relevo then confirmed that the player is not looking for a way out of England. According to Corriere dello Sport, there has been a ‘sudden and radical turning point’ in Juventus’ project. The fear of missing out on a Champions League spot – the club’s main objective for the season – has accelerated a ‘necessary corrective manoeuvre’. Juve want Tonali to bolster their midfield but Newcastle United would ask for €55m. In order to raise those funds, they plan to sell Nicolò Fagioli and the 19-year-old jewel Kenan Yildiz for around €35-40m. More Stories / Exclusive SM: Milan put forward new offer to Rabiot – why Moncada is determined to land him 30 August 2024, 12:20 SM: Kalulu to Juventus far from done – why a stalemate has developed 15 August 2024, 17:10 SM Exclusive: Fonseca makes Colombo request to Milan management – the situation 22 July 2024, 9:00 With that and the signing of Tonali they would satisfy Thiago Motta’s request of adding a dynamic midfielder who has aggression and intensity too. It would also allow the coach to use Teun Koopmeiners in a three-man midfield, like with Atalanta. In recent weeks there was also talk of Milan’s interest, the paper adds. However, the most concrete path seems to be the one leading to their rivals Juve, even if the transfer market is often full of surprises. If Milan spends 50 million out of nowhere i would be amazed. For the player that we gave for almost 70. Makes sense to bring him back, a milanista who gives 100% on the pitch and in this current situation would boost morale of the fans, but lets remember that this managment dont do things that make sense. What a heartbreak if he moves to Juventus… Juve can’t spend that much… They want to link him with Italy and since we all know the clowns will never spend the money, they are forcing the story of Juve. Sandro either moves to Milan or he stays at Newcastle… Actually they can exchange Tonali for Douglas Luiz. Remember when everyone here wanted Douglaz Luis? Lol. Douglas Luiz is not suitable for Motta’s tactics, and he is still regarded in the EPL. I would not entirely exclude that scenario. Not possible juventus sell yildiz for that peanuts that guy is thier main treat milan just need to see 4 dead woods like chukueze musah Emerson rlc tomori just get Tonali and 1 quality striker right back and quality attacking midfielder We could raise most of that by selling the two Englishmen and Chukwueze to rich stupid EPL clubs. GET IT DONE there’s a better chance of him going to Juventus than coming back here. At least under RedBird. Another bad action selling him to NU. Who is the director, sure they don’t have Milan’s DNA. Change all director and Zlatan. They useless, only money talk. Nothing more than backward performance. Juve have pleanty of mids, they actually need to sell. Their problem is their attack. I just saw a poll on whether Juventus should sell Yildiz to raise money to buy Tonali and so far over 80% said NO. But If Juventus are willing to let Yildiz go, Milan should jump on and buy him. Milan needs a player like Yildiz more, because they have plenty of box to box midfielders like Tonali. Yildiz’s next move is to a bigger club in the PL, not a mid-table Serie A club.

8564,06333D661ECC1D0679605B7AF47EFB1C,El Nacional: Xavi in ‘advanced talks’ with Milan as Fonseca’s position weakens,https://icdn.sempremilan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/fc-internazionale-v-fc-barcelona-group-c-uefa-champions-league.jpg,2024-12-18T11:50:00.000Z,Sempre Milan,https://sempremilan.com/xavi-in-advanced-talks-milan-barcelona,"A report from Spain has claimed that Xavi Hernandez is in advanced talks over taking the head coach job at AC Milan, replacing Paulo Fonseca. Conflicting news has come out regarding Fonseca’s future in recent days with some sources suggesting a bad result against Verona on Friday could see him sacked, but others believe he is safe for a while yet. According to El Nacional (via MilanNews) – which is a Catalan-based source – Xavi Hernández seems to be close to returning to the dugout as he is in advanced negotiations with Milan. The Spaniard is currently without a team after being fired by Barcelona at the end of last season. Xavi would get the chance to work with Rafael Leao, who was reportedly a transfer target when he was with Barca showing that he has an appreciation for the Portuguese winger. At the moment the rumour seems rather far-fetched, but it is clear that Fonseca must begin to show that he has a grip on the situation both in relation to results and squad management. Xavi was the manager of Al-Sadd in Qatar from July 2019 to November 2021, and then he became Barcelona boss until June 2024. He took charge of 143 games, with 91 wins, 23 draws, 29 losses, 280 goals scored and 158 against, winning LaLiga and the Supercopa. I think Xavi could be a good coach for my only concern with Xavi is the level of training intensity. There were rumours it was lacking when he coached Barca. He likes to promote youth and he is not a yes man which is something else I like. The question is can he be successful in Italy? Only Italian coaches bar Svennis and Mourinho has won the Serie A since the 90’s. This management needs to recalibrate their algorithm and hire coaches that know real tactics. Enough with the frauds! OMG! Xavi, really!? I sincerely hope this is BS, and it probably is. I would rb fine with Xavi concecaio and sarri but not allegri his tactics are out dated and his formation downs fit us at all We don’t need “tactics” right now. We need a manager that will get these prima donnas to run and get results. I couldn’t care less if we won every game from now until the end of the season 1-0 parking the bus. People don’t seem to understand how bad it will be if we miss out on the CL. We’re in an emergency. This! Milan needs a coach that will bring immediate change, not coaches that will need time to settle in in a country where they have never played or coached or Sarri, who is almost 70 and needs a year to implement his style of play. A proven coach who brings a certain level of guarantees in both serie A and UCL is needed. The time for experimenting was in the summer. I prefer Xavi then Fonseca 100%. But the issue is not just the coach but the prima donna of players that we have. And management needs to communicate more and not hide when the things are not right. Explain Cardinale what is your plan for the stadium explain where are we so fer from your targets!!!! You said that Milan will be again top in Europe. We are not even with the top of Italy imagine if we can play to win the champions League!!! Not the worst choise, he is a new promising coach. Might not work tho, its always a risk with young new young coaches. I would have preffered De Zerbi. He is Milan fan, more proven, and knows Italian football.

After visiting the facility, the coach of the Milan first team took part in a discussion with the boys, where they discussed value issues and parallels between everyday life and the world of football. “In everyday life as in football discipline and respect for the rules are fundamental values ​​to be able to achieve the goals we set ourselves,” he told them. “It is also very important to be aware that we are never alone, and that in times of need, asking for help is not a reason for shame but of great awareness. Whether it is people dear to us, friends, professionals or team-mates.” Subsequently, Fonseca went to a five-a-side football pitch inside the Institute, where he guided and participated in a training session with the boys themselves.

Okafor passed a late fitness test to take part in the game against Genoa on Sunday having missed the Red Star match due to back pain. Although he did not start, he came on for the final portion of the game and was unfortunately the subject of a disappointing cameo. Then, reports emerged on Monday night stating that he had been feeling some muscle discomfort and a calf problem was confirmed. Given that Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Christian Pulisic and Yunus Musah are all out, the timing is far from brilliant. According to La Gazzetta dello Sport, Fonseca will have to do without Okafor for some time because he has suffered a first-degree lesion of the soleus muscle in his right calf. A new scan will be carried out in 10 days, but the Swiss forward risks having to spend a month on the sidelines. If the fears regarding recovery time are confirmed, Okafor will also be forced to miss the Supercoppa Italiana in early January in Saudi Arabia too. Milan will face Juventus in the semi-finals on January 3, while the possible final against one of Inter or Atalanta would be played on January 6. Your email address will not be published.

In what was supposed to be a night that celebrated 125 years of Milan, the team were jeered off the field and protests erupted inside and outside the stadium. Some fans seem to have reached breaking point, with the team sat in eighth and points constantly being dropped. While Paulo Fonseca has the faith of the management for now, time must be running out for him to prove that he can engineer a surge towards the Champions League places. Otherwise, the minimum objective for the season could vanish very quickly. Seedorf was interviewed on Giulia Mizzoni’s YouTube channel and he spoke about how Milan are doing at the moment, with a nod to the past too of course. “The best thing was seeing former teammates or our idols from when we were kids again. Baresi, Rijkaard, Gullit are the ones who tell the story of the club. It was also nice to see the stadium full for a special evening that goes beyond the match,” he said (via MilanPress). “The current Milan is a team with potential. Changing the coach brings with it an important change, the consistency that depends on Fonseca’s new philosophy is missing. Consistency is also missing from the players, I think the main reason concerns the different ideas compared to the period with Pioli.” Well, there have been coaching changes in Bologna, Fiorentina and Lazio as well. But if you add “in a complex and historic club such as Milan”, I would agree. Your email address will not be published.

8564,83E0BCADD684E26653617879405749EA,CorSport: Milan seek midfield protection – Moncada left impressed by Genoa star,https://icdn.sempremilan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/monzagenoa.jpg,2024-12-18T10:20:00.000Z,Sempre Milan,https://sempremilan.com/milan-moncada-left-impressed-genoa-frendrup,"Paulo Fonseca is not happy with the current configuration of the AC Milan midfield department, and that is why a January signing will be explored. According to Corriere dello Sport this morning (via MilanPress), the Milan coach wants two things: greater protection and more rotation. These are the reasons why Milan will be looking for a new midfielder when the mercato reopens. The strong candidate is Morten Frendrup, observed first hand on Sunday evening at San Siro when Genoa emerged with a 0-0 draw. The Dane confirmed the positive impressions, acting almost as a first shield in front of the defence. The paper confirms that Frendrup is among the top names on the win list because, in addition to his ability to protect the back line, he stands out for his suffocating pressure on opponents. The fact he leads a lot of defensive stats among midfielders in Serie A shows it. More Stories / Exclusive SM: Milan put forward new offer to Rabiot – why Moncada is determined to land him 30 August 2024, 12:20 SM: Kalulu to Juventus far from done – why a stalemate has developed 15 August 2024, 17:10 SM Exclusive: Fonseca makes Colombo request to Milan management – the situation 22 July 2024, 9:00 However, there are obstacles too. Firstly there is competition from Atalanta, and secondly the club have to get rid of one or two players, with Luka Jovic and Noah Okafor being the two main suspects at present. The other two names for the midfield that the directors are looking into are Warren Bondo of Monza and Reda Belahyane of Hellas Verona, younger in age but equally with high potential. In addition to a potential new face from the mercato, there remains the hope that Ismael Bennacer will recover before the end of 2024 and look like his old self again after a lengthy injury problem. Frendrup is excellent defensively, but he plays in a team that literally leaves the ball to the other team and only defends in tight spaces. A very different situation than the one he will find at Milan. We also need a player that is able to help the build up from the back and find passing lanes. Fofana is not exactly that type of player. A player like Rovella would be perfect. If we need a rotation player Frendrup is fine. But I think we need a starter that can play with Fofana and Rejnders. Pretty good points actually. I think Frendrup is a good idea (at least more proven than Belahyane or Bondo) but given how shallow our midfield is, we will probably need more than one player anyways. IMO between now and the summer, all the senior midfielders not named Reijnders and Fofana should go. If we’re lucky, maybe we can get back Adli and we should try to get both of Frendrup and Ricci. Ricci is more creative and has good passing accuracy as well as defensive skills. “If we’re lucky, maybe we can get back Adli ” We? Lucky? Adli? Back? Naaah, wishful thinking. And speaking of Adli… Elsewhere saw a list of TOP20 players in Serie A so far this season (based on average match reviews). Guess who was the highest Milan player. Adli. Number 7. Then there was Pulisic (14th) and followed by CDK (15th). Although CDK might be an Atalanta player 100% already, I can’t remember what the deal was. And also worth noting, that out of the TOP-5, 3 were Inter-players. And funnily enough, Milan was the only team with representatives in the WORST-20 list from the top-10 teams. And we all know the name of the Brazilian on that list, now don’t we? 🙂 Interesting. Can you share the name of this list, I’d like to have a look at it. www[.]milannews[.]it/news/la-flop-20-di-serie-a-per-media-voto-c-e-anche-un-giocatore-del-milan-560121 www[.]milannews[.]it/news/la-top-20-di-serie-a-per-media-voto-c-e-un-milanista-in-graduatoria-560120 “We also need a player that is able to help the build up from the back and find passing lanes.” Who needs a player like that when we have a striker who will drop deep into own half to get the ball and do the midfielders’ job for them? 🙂 And we’ve been without a proper playmaker since Pirlo left and we’ve achieved soooooooooo much since that. I mean, we won a scudetto, right? 😀 No, you don’t need a player to build from the back when you have Fofana and Reijnders. What you need is a guy that is a top defensive midfielder who can pass to ball to Fofana, after recovering it. That is it. He can even stay back and defend. If we had a player with a passing capacity like that, we’d solve our 10 problem moving Reijnders up. Highly unlikely purchase as Moncada’s notes are all from 2010-2020 and they don’t have any comments on players from Serie A. Your email address will not be published.

He has been under scrutiny before every international break, but then a victory dissipated the clouds, Calciomercato informed. The boss is facing the same situation ahead of Friday’s game against Hellas Verona. The Rossoneri have won just once in the last five Serie A matches and sit in eighth position, seven points below Fiorentina and Lazio. They are out of the Scudetto fray already given the large disadvantage from Atalanta, Napoli, and Inter. If Milan pulled the plug on Fonseca anytime soon, they’d prioritize an Italian manager. Maurizio Sarri was extensively linked to them. He’s open to taking over a team midseason, provided the technical project convinces him fully. Instead, a return of Massimiliano Allegri, who doesn’t seem too eager, is unlikely. The new entry in the shortlist of replacements is Roberto Mancini. Both he and the former Juventus boss have been attached to Roma for next season. The ex-Italy and Saudi Arabia manager hasn’t ruled out such a possibility. The current Rossoneri skipper is under contract until 2027 with a €2.5M annual salary. It won’t be long before they are in real trouble unless they rip off a few wins in a row. While it wouldn’t be hard to upgrade on the bench, they haven’t allocated many resources to the coach’s wages in recent years. A few options would be unrealistic if they didn’t change that. Plus, they aren’t the best-run team, and some managers don’t like that. Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked * Comment * Name * Email * Website Δ"

Calciomercato.com report that Paulo Fonseca has lost two more players in view of the league match against Verona, in addition to Christian Pulisic and Ruben Loftus-Cheek. Firstly, Yunus Musah will still be out due to a problem with his flexor which caused him to miss the Genoa game on Sunday. The American is scheduled to return for the match against Roma at the end of December but the situation is more serious for Noah Okafor, who – in the final minutes of the match against the Grifone – suffered a muscular problem in his calf. It is a first degree lesion of the soleus muscle too and the Swiss will be re-evaluated in 10 days, but will certainly miss the Verona and risks having to sit out for a month. It comes after the former Red Bull Salzburg man skipped the Champions League match against Red Star due to back pain.

Alex Jimenez should start at left-back again but there could also be starts for Mattia Liberali and Francesco Camarda, who will at least be among those called up. Then, a chance might arrive for Filippo Scotti, a right winger who has 10 goal contributions for the Primavera this season. I’d play Liberali blindfolded over Chukwueze… terrible one dimensional player. If you stop him coming in on his left foot, you eliminate him a a threat.. Yep. Suso 2.0. If Morata is healthy, why not use him at AM and try Camarda at ST? Liberali can then get minutes off the bench. He did OK last time out, but his age and inexperience showed. Morata’s pressing will come in handy as well. We’re in desperate need of points… Absolutely LT. Good observation. This season already seems like a write off.

This morning’s edition of Tuttosport (via MilanNews) talks about the ‘Fonseca therapy’ used on Rafael Leao in recent weeks and which could now be seen again. The coach wants Theo to flourish, and believes that he can come out of a difficult moment just as the Portuguese winger did. Fonseca’s goal is to stimulate Theo’s character by benching him against Verona, but it can be a double-edged sword since not all players react in the same way to such a treatment. What it means is that Alex Jimenez – who performed well a few days ago against Genoa – is set for another chance. How will Theo response to being benched for two games in a row? Will he do it in the right way like Leao did in his time? Time will tell, but there has to be an eye on the Roma game to close 2024 and the Supercoppa semi-final against Juventus in early January.

Leao also went to the bench this year,” his representative said. Now it’s up to Theo to show that he wants to take back the starting position. Fonseca therapy – offload your incompetence onto your players and punish them for underperforming. Sell Theo, and find another Emerson Rojal for the other flank. Easy… Theo’s form has been poor. He doesn’t venture forward at all and whatever defensive duties he has, he botches. You can put some of it on Fonseca, but Theo has to take responsibility for his form.

8564,0FCAA2625C7B038A5FDD3A1532CDDF60,GdS: ‘Camarda time’ – Fonseca strongly tempted to give striker second start vs. Verona,https://icdn.sempremilan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/camarda-time-gazzetta.jpg,2024-12-18T09:19:00.000Z,Sempre Milan,https://sempremilan.com/camarda-time-fonseca-strongly-tempted-verona,"AC Milan head coach Paulo Fonseca is seriously considering starting Francesco Camarda against Hellas Verona on Friday, a report claims. As La Gazzetta dello Sport recall, Milan had the youngest team in the league on the pitch against Genoa with an average age of 24 years and 258 days. Over a year and a half ago against Cremonese they fielded a side that had an average age of 24 years and 165 days. If the glorious past seems like a distant memory after the 125th anniversary celebrations, the goal is to write new pages in the future with home-grown talents. This is good news for Camarda, who wasn’t a starter against Genoa, so he couldn’t further lower the average age of the XI. Fifteen minutes into the second half he came off the bench. Tammy Abraham had gone off at half-time due to a physical problem and Morata was clearly having an off night, with Camarda raising the volume from the fans pushing him for that first goal. More Stories about Milan Futuro Vis Pesaro 2-1 Milan Futuro: Late heartbreak after controversial opener 15 December 2024, 17:30 Assistant Baresi analyses Milan Futuro’s draw with Campobasso after Bonera sees red 6 December 2024, 17:00 Campobasso 1-1 Milan Futuro: Chaka Traore and Stalmach star in positive draw 5 December 2024, 22:10 Camarda does everything the coach asks: he presses the goalkeeper and the opposing defenders, he fights for every ball and has the quality to be dangerous in the area. Against Red Star in the Champions League for example his header led to Abraham’s winner. Now all that’s missing is his first goal with the big boys, but he needs service. Against Genoa he ran for a ball that seemed destined for a goal kick and hooked it back into the box, but at that point he was no longer inside the area ready to exploit his incredible sense for goal. Francesco was the youngest debutant in the entire history of Serie A, a record set on 25 November 2023 when he came on at 15 years, 8 months and 15 days against Fiorentina. He started against Cagliari a few weeks ago at the age of 16 years and 244 days. By scoring, Camarda could anticipate Roberto Mancini and Renato Buso, who scored at 16 years and 10 months. In the Champions League, however, Ansu Fati holds the record with a goal at San Siro against Inter when he was 17 years and 40 days, so there is still time. These are records and attention that Camarda has shown he can handle, also thanks to the protection of the club, his family and his agents. When he replaced the other Futuro star Mattia Liberali on Sunday, Camarda seemed like a veteran. He moves with ease, without fear or consideration. He needs more time to score, maybe an entire match and not just simple snippets, and he might just get that on Friday at the Stadio Bentegodi. Morata and Abraham are available but they are both in difficulty with regards to form. Camarda can play carefree and strong in the support of the crowd, hoping to show some of the wisdom he got from Pippo Inzaghi and Marco van Basten whom he spoke with at the weekend. The Futuro may have been created to help players like Camarda but at the moment it is a valuable reservoir of new talents and he is needed now, in the present. Honestly I would be happy if he plays Camarda, Jimenez and Liberali from the start. At least they will give it their best. Yes I support. I don’t think Liberali could do worse than RLC and Jimenez worse than Theo so far this season. What does Fonzie got to lose by playing them? Liberali is still raw. I don’t think he’s ready for first team. The likes of Jimenez and Vos should get more minutes though. Clearly streets above the other two options. Also Liberali on the right, Jiminez (obviously) and lets have Chaka, Vos and Stalmach on the bench… about time to give the senior players a kick up the butt… I expect to be roundly disagreed with but I would now lead with Camarda and Liberali at 9 and 10 (with Liberali and Pulisic rotating their roles on the pitch). Let’s grow them in a live setting. I don’t hold with the idea it will ruin them. Talent wise they are clearly good enough and psychologically, no one is asking them to Messi and Harland, no one is asking them to save us, just to simply not be any worse than RLC and Abraham (easy). We are no more likely to miss out on top 4 with kids. I know it’s not FC25 and I’m usually very conservative with these things, but at this point I’d go full Fergie 92. Ha, by the time I’d pressed Post (5 times!!!) other people had posted and NOT roundly disagreed with me 😀 100 percent agree, only thing extra I would say is play Terraciano instead of Emerson Royal and start integrating Bartesaghi more, it would then be time to sell RLC, Tomori etc and use money to help secure Ricci…. Well said Yes, maybe because they didn’t buy a striker when it was time, so there are no other options. We have Morata who is better to run after defenders than score, Abraham who is injured every 2 games and Camarda that is a talent but needs to actually score. Striker that doesn’t score goals is not that great. About time we get to see some young Italian players playing in this great club. I am certain they will give it their best unlike those over paid Super Stars. Kudos to Fonseca for backing up his words and throwing youth on. Doesn’t seem like theres a lot left to play for this season. Might as well give them reps while underperforming senior players get their heads on straight. Your email address will not be published.

8564,2616081C1C8F7766AE024FCADF5E6396,MN: ‘A sad déjà vu’ – Milan fear return of season-ending injury crisis,https://icdn.sempremilan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/ac-milan-v-lecce-serie-a-3.jpg,2024-12-17T20:00:00.000Z,Sempre Milan,https://sempremilan.com/milan-fear-return-of-season-ending-injury-crisis,"Last season, AC Milan were defined by the injury problems they faced and the issues eventually led to their season being heavily derailed. Unfortunately, it seems the problem may be restarting. Injuries have been semi-regular recently but by no means as bad as they were for large parts of last season. However, there are now fears about the injury issues heading back towards the direction of last season. As Milan News reports, on Friday, Milan will travel to Verona for Serie A action, but they will do so without six, and probably even seven players, after the news of Yunus Musah’s injury. Last season, it was an issue in defence, but now there is a hole in the midfield with three Trequartistas absent and this is without the presence of a natural No.10 too – another issue in itself. For this reason, Paulo Fonseca has been forced to look towards the youth roster, which sounds all too familiar. This is without even considering the fact that the Rossoneri are without Luka Jovic – though it can be debated whether he can truly be considered as an absence, Ismael Bennacer, Alessandro Florenzi and Noah Okafor. Five of those names are ‘repeat offenders’ and their issues this season were also seen last season, so their presence cannot be relied on, which creates further holes within the side. Add to the mix that Fofana is one yellow card from suspension. He’s likely to absent for Roma or some other upcoming fixture. We have no replacement for him. Relax, for Milan situation is same – if they finish one spot above relegation, or 8th spot on table. Well, that’s definitely one way of looking at things. 😀 What team dioes luka jovic play for Does* ow sh!t.. they’ve got excuse for their incompetent Your email address will not be published.

He’s been linked to Milan, Fiorentina, and Juventus in previous weeks. He’s generating interest in the Premier League as well. According to Alfredo Pedullà, Gian Piero Gasperini asked for another dynamic midfielder. The relationship between the two sides is excellent. La Dea quickly met the counterparty’s request for Mateo Retegui last summer after Gianluca Scamacca got hurt. Atalanta and the other teams would need to invest at least €20M. Genoa would gladly avoid losing a centerpiece in January. He has remained an integral part of their squad after the coaching change from Alberto Gilardino to Patrick Vieira. He has recorded 3 goals and 5 assists in the past 18 months. The Rossoblù appear to have solved their uncertain ownership situation, which might affect their January moves. The three 777 Partners board members have been ousted. A-Cap should foot an upcoming €45M capital increase ahead of a likely sale down the road, Il Secolo XIX reports (via Calcio e Finanza). Given his quality, energy, and versatility, he’s destined to become a rotational piece in a big team eventually. The Orobici don’t necessarily need a new midfielder, for instance, Marco Brescianini already isn’t playing regularly, but it wouldn’t hurt. Plus, Ederson might be set for greener pastures next summer. It’s always better to buy when a need isn’t so manifest. Your email address will not be published.

Real won 3-2, thanks to two important goals in the second half from Vinicius Junior and Jude Bellingham. Ademola Lookman had pulled one back to make it 3-2 but he created a vital chance in the 94th minute of the game, but Matteo Retegui somehow missed from point blank range. In the first half, Kylian Mbappe’s goal was cancelled out by Charles de Ketelaere’s penalty in stoppage time. After the game, Gian Piero Gasperini spoke to Sky about the loss and he was happy about the showing. He said, as relayed by TMW: “Both teams wanted to play, trying to win with their strength. For us there is a bit of disappointment, but we learn something from these games. We still lack something, but it is also a reason to improve and work. We come out defeated, even if maybe not in numbers and this will help us to take a small step forward.” Speaking of where La Dea could have done better, the Italian said: “We were moving a little too slowly, these teams close down well. We held the game well, but we could have been more dangerous because we could have been. A game that will be a great lesson, we are sorry to have lost but we will bounce back from these games.” Atalanta are ninth in the Champions League table and have every chance of going through to the next round. They are also top of the Serie A. Kaustubh Pandey I GIFN @2024 - All Rights Reserved. Get Football Group"

However, he hasn’t had any room with the first team during the regular season, and he has struggled to find his footing with the Futuro squad in Serie C too. According to Calciomercato, the Rossoneri are mulling the future of the starlet, whose contract runs out in 2026. It’s not so certain it’ll be with them, as he would like to be given a real shot. Atalanta and Fiorentina have shown interest and would be ready to pounce if he became available. Milan will have to make the call about Liberali next summer given the expiration date of his deal. The extension talks haven’t gone far due to his challenging season. He was named among the 60 most promising youngsters in the world by The Guardian. The 17-year-old hasn’t received consistent minutes in the Daniele Bonera-led team. He last appeared on October 30th and hasn’t been called up in the past month. He’s been sent back to the Primavera side, where he’s starring domestically and in the Youth League. The youngster has scored once in each competition. He also hit the net in his first match in the Coppa Italia Serie C but didn’t produce in seven appearances in the third division. Paulo Fonseca selected him twice without fielding him. His contract is more of a factor than his displays, as he’s super young and has all the time in the world to improve. Still, it’d be quite ludicrous if he didn’t resume playing regularly with the Futuro team. Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked * Comment * Name * Email * Website Δ"

Plenty is at stake, considering both teams desperately need three points to consolidate their hopes of securing automatic knockout qualification Atalanta head into proceedings in a buoyant mood after leapfrogging Napoli at the Serie A table’s summit over the weekend. Friday’s 2-1 home triumph against Milan saw Gian Piero Gasperini’s side open up a two-point gap at the top while extending their winning streak in all competitions to an eye-catching nine matches. Keen to build on last season’s UEFA Europa League success, Atalanta boast an impressive five-game unbeaten start to the newly formatted league phase (W3, D2). Despite commencing this round in fifth, the Italians can’t afford to rest on their laurels, with ninth-placed Aston Villa only one point adrift. Visiting Real Madrid would gladly trade places with Atalanta after back-to-back defeats to Milan and Liverpool significantly derailed their chances of securing automatic qualification. Carlo Ancelotti’s charges, stuck in 24th in the 36-team table, trail eighth-placed Monaco by four points, meaning there’s virtually no margin for error in Bergamo. Los Blancos regained lost confidence in the build-up to this trip with a landslide 3-0 victory at Girona on Saturday, whittling down the gap on La Liga leaders Barcelona to only two points. More importantly, out-of-sorts superstar Kylian Mbappe returned to the scoresheet after missing consecutive penalties against Athletic Bilbao and Liverpool. Atalanta Poised to avenge a 2-0 defeat in August’s UEFA Super Cup, Atalanta will be out to seize the momentum and potentially land a knockout blow on Real Madrid’s quest to secure automatic qualification. However, that task is nothing short of Herculean, with La Dea losing both previous Champions League meetings against the reigning European champions, including a narrow 1-0 loss on this ground. Atalanta’s overall home record against Spanish opposition can’t inspire much confidence either (W1, L2). On top of that, both their home matches in this season’s league phase have ended scoreless, even though Gasperini’s team generated a promising 1.75 xG or better on both occasions. However, Arsenal and Celtic stood firm at the Gewiss Stadium. Young Boys couldn’t follow in their footsteps as Charles De Ketelaere’s incredible performance inspired Atalanta to a thumping 6-1 triumph in Bern. Indeed, the Belgian forward contributed to five goals against the Swiss side, forming part of Atalanta’s sterling run of scoring 2+ goals in their last nine competitive outings. Real Madrid Real Madrid’s chances of avoiding a knockout phase playoff place look slim after Ancelotti’s men suffered three defeats across the opening five matchdays (W2). Los Merengues find themselves in uncharted territory ahead of the kick-off. Two-goal margin reverses to Milan and Liverpool put them at risk of losing three consecutive games in the same Champions League season for the first time in club history. Oddly enough for a team of their stature, Real Madrid’s last five competitive fixtures have fluctuated between victories (3) and defeats (2), with four of those five results yielding a 2+ goal margin and seeing the winner on the day keeping a clean sheet. Therefore, breaking the deadlock could be a match-defining moment. Topically, Real Madrid had conceded first in back-to-back away defeats before putting Girona to the sword at the weekend. However, it’s worth noting that they’ve lost both Champions League games on the road this season without scoring, which paints a bleak picture for Ancelotti’s underperforming crop of superstars. In addition to long-term absentee Gianluca Scamacca, Atalanta boss Gasperini can’t call upon the services of experienced wingbacks Juan Cuadrado and Davide Zappacosta. All eyes will be on Mateo Retegui, Ademola Lookman, and De Ketealere as Gasperini’s formidable trio continues to tear opposition defenses at will. As for Real Madrid, Ancelotti faces a selection nightmare, lacking several significant defensive pieces. Davide Alaba, Dani Carvajal, Eder Militao, and Ferland Mendy are unavailable for Tuesday’s trip. Furthermore, Eduardo Camavinga is on the sidelines with a thigh injury. Atalanta (3-4-2-1): Carnesecchi; Djimsiti, Hien, Kolasinac; Bellanova, De Roon, Ederson, Ruggeri; De Ketelaere, Retegui, Lookman. Real Madrid (4-3-3): Courtois; Vazquez, Tchouameni, Rudiger, F Garcia; Valverde, Bellingham, Modric; Rodrygo, Mbappe, Vinicius. As one of the most in-form teams in Europe, Atalanta can realistically hope to topple the record-time European champions. Though Real Madrid are in a dire situation and can ill-afford a slip-up, we expect Gasperini’s free-firing squad to pour more misery on Ancelotti’s star-studded line-up.

The player had struggled at Milan but has thrived at Atalanta under Gian Piero Gasperini since last season and after the game, he was asked by Sky Italia as to what is the difference between his usage at Bergamo and how Stefano Pioli used him to at Milan. He said, as relayed by MilanNews: “There are several things. Everyone thinks it’s just one but it’s not like that. The first is because I had been in Italy for a year longer but also the way I play: I stand taller and play more freely, I feel more important during the match.” Speaking specifically about his usage against Milan yesterday, the versatile forward said: “The tactic depends a bit on the opponent: today I played against Thiaw but I had to go a bit wide to create space. I feel good when I can go a bit outside.” He has contributed to eight league goals this season, scoring three times and picking up five assists.

That’s one of the reasons they’re out of the Scudetto picture already in December, as Morata tried to explain Rossoneri’s collapse in Bergamo. “Because we are always playing against top-level opponents. If you don’t keep totally focused in every situation, you risk defeat,” the Milan ace continued. “We conceded two goals from set plays, and if you are not paying enough attention, then it all becomes more complicated. “At the end of the day, there’s always something that doesn’t work as it should. Sometimes we do well in certain areas, then are penalized in different ones. We just need to work on all the different areas that involve football.

Another disappointing result leaves the Rossoneri a whopping ten points adrift of table-topping Napoli, who will take on Lazio on Sunday. Christian Pulisic could’ve fired Milan in front only a few seconds into the game, but Marco Carnesecchi thwarted his close-range effort. Buoyed by their goalkeeper’s early heroics, Atalanta grabbed the lead in the 12th minute through former Rossoneri flop Charles De Ketelaere. It took Milan ten minutes to equal the score as Rafael Leao breezed past Raoul Bellanova before serving Alvaro Morata on a platter. The Spaniard tapped home from a couple of yards out to secure parity at the halftime interval. Following an enthralling first half, both sides took their feet off the pedal in the second half, resulting in a chess game for most of the second 45 minutes. However, Paulo Fonseca’s decision to settle for a draw backfired on Milan as Ademola Lookman scored a late winner for Atalanta. Milan paid the ultimate price for an incomprehensible second-half approach as we look at our player ratings. Mike Maignan – 6.5 De Ketelaere’s close-range header left the French goalkeeper powerless, but he made several vital saves to help Milan avoid a more devastating loss in Bergamo. Theo Hernandez – 5 It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say this was one of his least impressive performances in the Milan shirt. In addition to being outjumped by the Belgian forward, he was quiet in attack, especially in the second half. Malick Thiaw – 6.5 Despite his see-saw form since returning from injury, the German talent held his ground against Serie A’s top-scorer Mateo Retegui. Matteo Gabbia – 7 Particularly dominant in the air, the homegrown Rossoneri defender enjoyed a near-flawless game, even though Milan conceded twice. Emerson Royal – 5.5 When it looked like the Brazilian was finding his feat, he returned to old habits of being completely useless in attack while losing sight of Lookman for Atalanta’s second. Youssouf Fofana – 6 The Frenchman’s commendable defensive effort wasn’t insufficient to atone for a near-anonymous offensive role. He needs to take more responsibility in the build-up! Tijjani Reijnders – 5.5 It was a rare night off from the free-firing midfielder. The most creative Milan player was nowhere to be found at the Gewiss Stadium. Yunus Musah – 6 Fonseca’s conservative approach with the USMNT star as a winger didn’t pay off this time, as Musah couldn’t do anything noteworthy in the final third. Christian Pulisic – 6.5 Although he failed to score from a promising position in the first half, his withdrawal toward the end of the first half showed how significant he is to Milan’s attack. They did nothing without their talismanic forward. Rafael Leao – 6 Except for a blistering run before setting up Morata for the goal, the Portuguese winger struggled to impact the game, especially after the break. Alvaro Morata – 6.5 Scored one and had another one disallowed for offside, the Euro 2024 winner did his part tonight, but his teammates let him down, denying him proper service in the box.

The early rounds of the Coppa Italia is often the time where coaches give regular starters some time off their feet and let some of the players lower on the depth chart get a chance to show out, and maybe test out a tactical wrinkle or two. Related But with Juventus’ injury situation still critical, doing that in Tuesday night’s round of 16 tie against Cagliari was going to take some creativity. With Bremer and Juan Cabal out for the year, the depth in defense is nonexistent. The midfield and attack were less thin, but it was still difficult to significantly rotate their lineup. So Thiago Motta decided to let his freak flag fly a little bit. He played a pair of midfielders as defenders, and made a major change to the midfield and forward line that could have a lot of bearing on how the team might attack as the season progresses. After an almighty wobble in the early going, the changes came together. As the night progressed, the Bianconeri finally did something that has eluded them for the last few months: they made Cagliari — who had stolen a point from them in October with a late penalty — look like the relegation struggler they are. They took the lead on the stroke of halftime, then took over in the second half, blitzing the Sardinian outfit with some excellent goals to bring home a 4-0 win to push them into the quarterfinal of the competition for the 20th consecutive season. Motta was still missing Andrea Cambiaso, Jonas Rouhi, and Arkadiusz Milik, while Douglas Luiz was held out for load management after returning to the fold at the weekend. The usual 4-2-3-1 formation was retained, but with some interesting tweaks. One surprise was in goal. Traditionally the realm of the No. 2 keeper throughout the tournament, it was Michele Di Gregorio who was given the gloves. His back four was shaken up quite a bit. Nicolò Savona and Pierre Kalulu were normal sights, but Manuel Locatelli and Weston McKennie at center- and left-back, respectively, were quite unusual. The midfield also saw a shakeup, with Teun Koopmeiners being dropped back into the pivot alongside Khephren Thuram. Kenan Yildiz was shifted inside to the trequartista position, flanked by Francisco Conceição and Samuel Mbangula in support of Dusan Vlahovic. Cagliari coach Davide Nicola had three crunch matchups against others in the relegation fight coming up, and with that in mind he made wholesale changes to his lineup. He settled on a 4-4-1-1 formation. Simone Scuffet started in goal, screened by Gabriele Zappa, Mateusz Weiteska, José Luis Palomino, and Tommaso Augello. Nadir Zortea and Alessandro Deiola played wide in midfield, surrounding the duo of Rǎsvan Marin and Matteo Prati. Gianluca Gaetano played behind Gianluca Lapadula up front. The experiments had an inauspicious start. Less than 40 seconds into the game, the movement of Gaetano and Lapadula pulled the back line apart, leaving the latter to latch on to a ball by Zortea nine yards out, but he put the ball straight at Di Gregorio, who responded with a kick save. Two more followups were blocked and a final one put way over the bar before things calmed down. Whatever Motta had wanted to see out of his new-look lineup, giving up four shots in the first 45 seconds of the match certainly wasn’t it. Cagliari used the momentum to dictate the pace of play for the opening stages. But Juve showed their own danger in the 13th minute when a blocked shot fell to Vlahovic, who blazed it over the near corner from deep in the left channel. As the first half wore on, Juve slowly started to reverse the flow and push into the Cagliari half. Unsurprisingly, Concieção looked to be the most dangerous Juventus player on the field. In the 28th minute he cut inside and put a curling effort millimeters wide of the far post, then eight minutes later he forced Scuffet to throw a fist into the air to parry a strong shot over the bar. Juve was more and more dominant as the half wore on, and they were finally rewarded a minute before the break. The move started with a long ball to Mbangula. He was confronted with a wall of red-and-blue shirts, but managed to flick it back to Yildiz. The teenage Turk made himself a passing lane with a quick move and sent the ball to the feet of Vlahovic, who had stolen in front of Weiteska. The striker settled the ball, turned 90 degrees, and rolled the ball through Weiteska’s legs, off the inside of the post, and into the goal. It was all the more impressive on subsequent viewings when you realize that Vlahovic never actually looked up at the target. Cagliari made another early push for control after the break, but that was snuffed out within eight minutes. After Yildiz earned a free kick in the middle of the field, Koopmeiners lined the ball up. The ball was close to 30 yards out — not that that mattered to the Dutchman, who absolutely ripped the ball into the top corner to double the lead. It was almost 3-0 less than two minutes later, but a wonderful chipped finish by Vlahovic was invalidated by the offside flag. A few minutes later he came inches away from another when he stretched to redirect an errant shot by Conceição. Striker and keeper each continued to look for a third, coming oh-so-close to definitively killing the game off on a number of occasions. Nico Gonzalez joined in the effort for that game-killing strike after he came on the field in the 66th minute, quickly seeing a header off a corner deflected just wide. Vlahovic saw another offside flag go a few minutes later when he redirected an errant Concieção with his head. With 12 minutes left he made an out-and-out mistake when he stole the ball and streaked downfield, but as he rounded Scuffet he took a touch that was far too heavy and killed his angle to the point where he ended up pushing the ball into the side netting. The third goal finally came with 10 minutes left, and finally saw Conceição claim the goal he richly deserved. Set up by a short field following a turnover, Conceicao was fed into the box by Gonzalez and then slammed the ball pasrt Scuffet to finish things off. Then the returning Gonzalez got in on the act, stealing the ball in his own half and showing Vlahovic how to finish a one-on-one, floating an absolutely gorgeous shot over Scuffet from just outside the box while running at full speed to put an exclamation point on things. MICHELE DI GREGORIO - 7. Made a couple of impressive 1-on-1 saves, and made a couple of nice long kicks that were right on the money. NICOLÒ SAVONA - 6. An awful start after his role on that early chance, but things settled down and was solid from then on. PIERRE KALULU - 7. Blocked a pair of shots and completed 96 percent of his passes. Formed some pretty good chemistry with Locatelli in real time in the back. MANUEL LOCATELLI - 7. An impressive game for a guy playing a position he’d never played before in a competitive match. Not only was he excellent defending (after that opening scare), he made four key passes from that center-back position. Very impressive. WESTON McKENNIE - 7. Got a few bumps early going, but also registered four key passes, Although he wasn’t as successful as Locatelli, he proved serviceable there in a pinch. KHEPHREN THURAM - 7. Easily guided Juve’s makeshift defense and was a powerhouse. Won all but one of his duels and made a pair of key passes. TEUN KOOPMEINERS - 6. Completed all 46 of his passes, and that goal was an absolute cracker. FRANCISCO CONCEIÇÃO - 7.5. Had three shots on target and all of them were deeply concerning for Scuffet in goal. A danger every time he touched the ball. KENAN YILDIZ - 6. Had the assist to Vlahovic on the opener. Playing centrally, he may be better than Koopmeiners until he manages to intervene. SAMUEL MBANGULA - 7. Had three key passes and also made three tackles on the other end. Made an effective case that he should be playing more. DUSAN VLAHOVIC - 7. An accelerant is a paint thinner. He had a very well-taken first goal, and he could’ve had two more if he’d had a little bit better. FEDERICO GATTI - 7. Solidified the back after Juve were up by multiple scores. Was rarely seriously challenged. NICO GONZALEZ - 8. Provided the assist for Conceição and scored one of the most beautiful goals of the year to put an exclamation point on things. He brings an aerial presence that none of our forwards other than Vlahovic has, which can be a huge boost to the attack. TIMOTHY WEAH - NR. Officially credited with the assist on Gonzalez’s goal, making it an assist once in nine touches. A good move that no one I know is going to be making the phone while I came out of the Berlin. VASILIJE ADZIC - NR. Struck the wall with a free kick and was slow to show him the ropes in the middle. We’ll see how he develops. Thiago Motta ran a few experiments Tuesday night. Let’s look at them one by one: This has been floated once or twice since the depth was shot to hell in the back, and Motta finally decided to experiment with him in the position. That first moment right out of the blocks was harrowing, for sure, but he settled down and ended up turning in an excellent game. He could be used as a deputy back there until we land a new defender in the January transfer window. Not quite a seamless as Locatelli, but added a dimension to the team in possession that Cambiaso often does by moving forward into the center of midfield. Another experiment that could be expanded on until reinforcements arrive in January. Koopmeiners was a little slow to get into this, but you could see that him pushing up from deep and making runs is, in fact, the way he likes to play best. Conversely, Yildiz was placed in the center of the field and I thought he immediately brought a level of flow to the attack that had been missing with Koopmeiners on the field. All of the biggest tactical and selection choices that Motta made today came up sevens. It’s not going to be that good all the time, but Motta can rest easier after Tuesday night, knowing that he has a couple of options for changing things or giving people a day off until he finally gets more bodies in like a Camry. Juve have a Sunday date at Monza, then a massively important match a week later against Fiorentina that will have huge top four implications. After that the team decamps to Saudi Arabia for the four-team Supercoppa mini tournament, with AC Milan the first test there. Gambling Problem? Call 1-800-GAMBLER (1-800-426-2537). Hope is here.

They have sort of blocked him for June. They’ll try to convince Feyenoord to let him go in January already, Alfredo Pedullà relays. The Bianconeri plot to shell out €25M plus bonuses for the Slovak. They consider him perfect for Thiago Motta’s style given his skillset, experience, and ability to feature as a left-back in a pinch. He has already spent time in Italy, even though he was a fringe player at Fiorentina. Juventus believe to have done enough to sign Hancko next summer but will attempt to accelerate his arrival. It’ll come down to Feyenoord’s willingness to part ways with their linchpin midseason. If not, the Old Lady will seal the deal in the following months to avoid a bidding war. It remains to be seen whether Facundo Gonzalez will be part of the operation. He moved to the Eredivisie on loan with a €6M option to buy. He has played seven times so far, never from the start. Considering the makeup of the defense, and the fact that Gleison Bremer will return eventually, a lefty would be a strong fit. Given their ongoing issues, it’d be recommendable to add somebody with strong leadership skills rather than a youngster, albeit talented. If they are sure they’ll get him down the line, it could change their January plans. They might go for a band-aid to get through the season rather than orchestrating a different purchase.

He spoke to Mediaset before the Coppa Italia victory versus Cagliari. “The relationship with him and his agent is excellent. We have decided to meet after the transfer market since he has one more year on his contract. We’ll look to conduct things in the best possible way.” Giuntoli was also asked about Antonio Silva. “It’s still early, and teams usually show their cards as late as possible. We’ll know more about it in early January.” Vlahovic has been freshly linked to Chelsea and Arsenal by Team Talk. In the meantime, he has quickly mended fences with the Ultras after a spat and scored again. The official took stock of the season so far. “We started from scratch with many new kids and a new coach with a completely different football philosophy. We were playing very well at the beginning, then the crowded schedule and injuries caused some problems. It’s paramount to stay united and think positively. We’ll draw a balance in the end.” The sooner, the better, but they realistically have until June to negotiate. While the team has been longing to reduce his massive wages, it’d be surprising if they succeeded given his age and the natural progression of footballers’ salaries. Rather, they’d be lucky if he agreed to re-up at his current numbers without asking for a raise. Your email address will not be published.

For much of the opening 45 minutes of Tuesday night’s Coppa Italia Round of 16 tie against Cagliari, things were looking ... for the lack of a better term ... not so great. Juventus’ attack, one that is certainly under a massive microscope these days, had yet to test Cagliari goalkeeper Simone Scuffet all that much, with the overwhelming majority of the 12 shots recorded not on target. Then the 44th minute arrived. As did Dusan Vlahovic showing what a strong man he is. And, what felt like somewhat out of nowhere, Vlahovic — the man who helped Juve salvage a point at the Allianz just 72 hours earlier — broke the deadlock that certainly broke the stranglehold that was hovering over the Bianconeri attack. Vlahovic’s goal right on the doorstep of halftime proved to be the kick in the backside that Juventus needed to do what we’ve seen so many times before at this stage of the Coppa Italia, with a second-half onslaught paving the way for a 4-0 romp over Cagliari that propelled Motta’s squad into the quarterfinals where Empoli now awaits. Three Juventus summer signings — Teun Koopmeiners, Francisco Conceição and Nico Gonzalez — ensured that what happened against Cagliari earlier this season wasn’t going to repeat itself and put Juve in danger of any sort of Coppa Italia silliness. No risking of a draw with that second-half performance. None of that. Thankfully. That’s what we all needed after the last few weekends. (And much of this season based on how many draws Juventus have recorded through the first 16 league games.) This proved to be Juventus doing what they haven’t done a lot lately outside of their win over Manchester City a week ago — they not only pushed forward and got a second goal, but they were able to put Cagliari away with distance to spare. There was no risk of seeing Cagliari getting back into the game after Koopmeiners’ brilliant curling free kick made it 2-0 early in the second half. That has been one of Juventus’ biggest issues so far this season — and especially one that has happened against smaller clubs and potential relegation battlers domestically. Look no further than the last time Juve stepped on the field in Turin against Venezia — they couldn’t put the 20th-place visitors away, and it came back to bite them big time, with only Vlahovic’s stoppage-time penalty saving them from their first loss of the season. Not every game against a team in the bottom half of the table is going to be like this, but this sure was a pleasant change from what Juventus has been doing for much of the 2024-25 season. To put a team away and do it with room to spare is what Thiago Motta wants to see more of from his team, and for them to actually go out and do it was a nice change. Just like many of us said last week when Juve beat Manchester City, it’s one game but hopefully it’s something that can happen much more often in the future. It’s one step, and we all know that another relegation battler is awaiting Juve over the weekend in Serie A, but this should be a useful tool for Motta’s squad to show them that they can (and should) do this more often. Now it’s just about putting it into practice on a much more consistent basis. Hopefully. Because if not, then the one trophy that Juve are defending this season will be lifted by somebody else come the springtime. Gambling Problem? Call 1-800-GAMBLER (1-800-426-2537). Hope is here.

He’s been linked to Milan, Fiorentina, and Juventus in previous weeks. He’s generating interest in the Premier League as well. According to Alfredo Pedullà, Gian Piero Gasperini asked for another dynamic midfielder. The relationship between the two sides is excellent. La Dea quickly met the counterparty’s request for Mateo Retegui last summer after Gianluca Scamacca got hurt. Atalanta and the other teams would need to invest at least €20M. Genoa would gladly avoid losing a centerpiece in January. He has remained an integral part of their squad after the coaching change from Alberto Gilardino to Patrick Vieira. He has recorded 3 goals and 5 assists in the past 18 months. The Rossoblù appear to have solved their uncertain ownership situation, which might affect their January moves. The three 777 Partners board members have been ousted. A-Cap should foot an upcoming €45M capital increase ahead of a likely sale down the road, Il Secolo XIX reports (via Calcio e Finanza). Given his quality, energy, and versatility, he’s destined to become a rotational piece in a big team eventually. The Orobici don’t necessarily need a new midfielder, for instance, Marco Brescianini already isn’t playing regularly, but it wouldn’t hurt. Plus, Ederson might be set for greener pastures next summer. It’s always better to buy when a need isn’t so manifest. Your email address will not be published.

He spoke to the press during the Golden Boy award (via Goal). “He’s a very talented player who can star for any team in the world. He’s happy where he is, and the club feels the same. I’ll say he’ll 100 percent join them permanently only when he puts pen to paper. Right now, it’s just a strong possibility because he wants to stay and the Bianconeri will do everything to keep him. I think that, in normal conditions, everything will go well, but we’ll discuss it at the right moment.” Mendes is reportedly working on bringing another of his clients, Antonio Silva, to Juventus, but he played coy in this case. “It’s still too early. In football, you have to wait for the right time to understand what will happen. He belongs to Benfica. We’ll see in a few weeks.” Despite the strange formula, it looks like the Old Lady did their homework well on the former. It’d be a surprise if they didn’t acquire him at this point, even if it’ll cost them a pretty penny. It’d be odd if they pulled the trigger relatively soon, as there’s not much urgency. Instead, their new defender will come down to the price tag and his team’s willingness to do business in January, which is always a touchy matter when it comes to players who aren’t outcasts.

A lot has happened at Juventus between May 15 and the present day as we sit here a week before Christmas. The roster that faced Atalanta in last season’s Coppa Italia final in Rome has been drastically turned over, and of course the man who is now managing said squad is different from the one who lifted the trophy following an eventful night in the Italian capital. All of that is to say that the Coppa Italia is very much back — and a little earlier than it has been in previous years. Thanks in large part to the Champions League’s new league phase having more games compared to the previous group stage, Juventus will now jump into the Coppa Italia fray a month earlier than we have become accustomed to. With it comes Juve facing a team that they have already faced this season — although that result is very much not one to really boast about despite the lack of success that Cagliari have had in the first half of the 2024-25 campaign. Although, there is a catch to all of this: Cagliari just so happens to be one of the 10 teams that Juventus have drawn against already this season. So, as much as these round of 16 ties have a history of being matchups that overwhelmingly favor Juventus, we have evidence to the contrary that Thiago Motta’s squad have already struggled to put Cagliari away this season. So that basically means one of the extremely obvious themes of Tuesday night’s matchup in Turin is this: Will Juventus be able to actually beat a team that they have already draw against once this season? It’s the first time that we find Juve in this kind of spot this season with the Coppa Italia arriving a little earlier than is customary on the schedule. And with Juventus having so many draws, it’s something that we’ll probably be saying once the midway point of the Serie A season comes and goes and the second half of the calendar begins. It’s pretty hard to peg where Motta’s squad is at after their most recent results. Over the past week, we’ve seen Juventus battle back for a draw against Motta’s former side Bologna, they’ve gotten a big win in the Champions League over Manchester City — albeit a City squad that are in the midst of the worst-ever stretch of Pep Guardiola’s managerial career — and then rallying late for a draw against last-place Venezia. It’s a total mixed bag and feels like a microcosm of how things are going for Motta and Juventus this season. But they will need to see that change if they want prevent their run in the Coppa Italia ending right as its getting underway. (Plus, it just feels weird having this line of thinking against a side like Cagliari that is currently sitting in the Serie A relegation zone and has won just once since Oct. 25.) If Juventus are to get past Cagliari, they will face Empoli in the quarterfinals after the Tuscan side upset Fiorentina on penalties two weeks ago in Florence. With a few players back from injury but likely unable to play anything close to a full 90 minutes, this is the balancing act that Juventus’ manager must try and play. There are players that desperately need a rest, but with the current injury list being what it is and those who are just back from injury not having many minutes in their legs, it’s a weird middle ground to be in. Juve manager Thiago Motta did not hold a pre-match press conference on Monday, so we’re not totally sure where his mind is at in terms of squad rotation. We know how much he would love to rotate his squad on a regular basis — just look at what he did at Bologna last year and in the early parts of this season before the injury crunch arrived as evidence to that — but that just hasn’t been possible over the last month because so many players are out. On top of the three long-term absentees, Motta is expected to be without Andrea Cambiaso, Jonas Rouhi and Douglas Luiz, according to a report from Romeo Agresti on Monday. That means there’s no depth in defense and no one less body in the midfield. (Although, as Agresti said, Douglas Luiz’s absence seems more planned than something that has come up following the Venezia draw.) So, unfortunately, the starting lineup is probably going to look a lot like it has over the last couple of weeks. That is just the byproduct of so many injuries and so many fixtures in such a short amount of time. Not just the fact that it was a draw. But also the simple fact of not putting one of the worst teams in Serie A away when you have the chance and then see them come back and tie things up. It’s the same kind of situation that we’re seeing from this team more and more against the provincial sides in Serie A. And we have the latest example from just a couple of days ago against Venezia when Juventus couldn’t get a second goal, then saw the visitors take a 2-1 lead only for Dusan Vlahovic to score the game-tying penalty kick right before the final whistle. At this point, it feels like Juve have drawn against teams in every way you possibly can. That’s just what happens when you have 10 draws through your first 16 league games. So now, as Juve face a side they are expected to beat and advance to the Coppa Italia quarterfinals, the fact that they’ve already drawn once against Cagliari is very much fresh in the mind of a lot of people. That’s especially true considering all the draws that have happened over the course of the last two months, too. For yet another game, Juventus are expected to have just four defenders available — Federico Gatti, Pierre Kalulu, Danilo and Nicolo Savona. While we didn’t get any sort of squad update from Motta on Monday, we can pretty much guess that those who were out against Venezia will be out against Cagliari, with Cambiaso and Rouhi being the two short-term absentees. This will be the same quartet that started against Manchester City. It’s the same quartet that started against Venezia. So, put that all together and this group will likely be asked to play another 90 minutes — and a grand total of over 270 when it’s all said and done — in less than a week. It’s fair to say that Juventus’ defense had much more to do against City as compared to Venezia. But it’s also true that Juve’s defense allowed one of the lowest-scoring teams in Serie A to get back into the game and take the lead shortly thereafter. So now, on a very quick turnaround of just 72 hours after the draw with Venezia, we are about to find out just how much fatigue is in those legs. In a perfect world, Motta would be able to recover and somebody like Kalulu or Gatti (or — gasp! — even both) could get the night off. But because Juventus’ injury situation is what it is and both of the season-ending knee injuries are to Gleison Bremer and Juan Cabal, Juve’s sudden lack of depth at the back is resulting in some players logging bigger amounts of minutes than their manager would certainly like.

With Juventus’ pleasantly surprising Champions League over Manchester City last Wednesday night, Thiago Motta’s squad had the chance finish the week out with some good vibes against the last-place team in Serie A. Everything was set to have a good week. It really, really was — Juve’s playing at home once again, the team is starting to get a few players back from injury and Venezia was rolling in with just two wins to their record so far this season. And instead ... Well, you guessed it — another draw against a team in the bottom half of the Serie A table. If not for Dusan Vlahovic’s penalty in stoppage time, Juventus would have been handed their first loss of the season by the team currently sitting in 20th place. Instead, the 2-2 draw marked the 10th time (!!) in 16 league fixtures under Motta that Juventus have recorded just one point at the final whistle. It’s a frustrating time for sure. That’s especially true when Juventus were very much celebrating a very big and important win on the Allianz Stadium field just a few days earlier.

As Juventus Women get set to flip their calendar from 2024 to 2025, one thing regarding the Bianconere’s 2024-25 season to date has been a welcome return to previous campaigns: they are very much right in the thick of a Scudetto race again. The 2023-24 season was very much not that, with a failed European campaign that was ended basically right as the qualification process got started and a domestic season that saw a coaching change and plenty of struggles that allowed Roma to run away with the title. But Sunday’s dominant 3-0 win over Fiorentina didn’t just mark the fact that they’ve played their final domestic fixture of the 2024 calendar year. It was also a victory that extended an impressive 13-game unbeaten run under first-year manager Massimiliano Canzi and pushed Juve’s lead over the chasing pack to seven points, with two-time defending Serie A Femminile champions Roma tied on points with second-place Inter. It’s quite the turn of events compared to where things were just about a year ago when Juventus Women’s season was starting to truly unravel under then-manager Joe Montemurro, who departed the club in early March and has since gone on to take over at French giants Lyon. Juve forward Sofia Cantore, arguably the breakout star of Juve’s season to date, added yet another goal to her tally for the year in the win over Fiorentina. Tied for second in the league in goals behind teammate Cristiana Girelli, Cantore has eight goals in 17 appearances in all competitions. Her first goal, off a brilliant run on the counterattack by Chiara Beccari that went nearly three-quarters of the field, was proof of just how in-form Cantore continues to be. (Her second goal, just a couple of highlights later in the video below, was just as good, with a swerving shot to the far post after making a cutting run in from the left wing.) The only remaining fixture before the holiday break is Wednesday night’s Women’s Champions League group stage finale against Vålerenga Damer, the only team Juve have beaten in the group stage this season. With Juventus Women having been eliminated from advancing thanks to their loss to Arsenal last month, it will serve only as a dead rubber. But it also serves as the point where Juve can officially shift all of their focus to domestic competition once the final whistle is fired off at Biella is heard. And with the way that the Serie A Femminile is set up now with the two different phases, the more of a lead you can continuously build during the first 18 games of the season can only benefit you once things break off into the two five-team groups and you’re set to face the four best teams in the league two more times before a champion is crowned. It is something that Roma certainly benefited from during the “poule scudetto” last season, with Juventus being their closest competition but very much in close enough striking distance to put the champions in serious danger. Having such a nice lead heading into the holiday break is crucial for this reason as well: Juve will face Roma and Inter in back-to-back games within a six-day span in late January. If Canzi’s squad were to win either one or both, they could very well be looking at a lead atop the table that is either close to or approaching double digits. Knowing that there will be two more head-to-head matchups during the poule scudetto, the more breathing room the better for the Juve women. And that what makes their success all the more impressive to begin the 2024-25 season. The UWCL group stage didn’t turn out to be the same kind of surprise following the two-legged upset of Paris Saint-Germain — one of last season’s semifinalists — in the final qualification round. with Arsenal and Bayern Munich quickly establishing themselves as the top two teams in the group. But even with important injuries at the back — including center back Estelle Cascarino undergoing season-ending knee surgery last week — Juve’s claimed 11 wins in their first 13 league games to set the pace atop the table. In a season that had some thinking this team could be in for an interesting go of things with a new manager, some very talented players leaving and plenty of changes in terms of additions to the roster, the only thing Juventus Women has done domestically is win, win and win some more. It’s helped them get back to where they spent so much time during their first five years of existence — and that’s something that anybody in bianconere is happy to see. Gambling Problem?

The striker quarreled with a portion of the fans. He was the recipient of derogatory chants while leaving the pitch. “I understand the disappointment for the last results, and you have all the right to voice it. I’ve always respected you, giving my whole for the jersey. I thank you for the support you provide daily. Now, it’s important to keep supporting the team and be united to restart together.” According to La Gazzetta dello Sport, Vlahovic spoke with the management on Sunday and let it be known that he was initially quarreling from afar with a single fan, who was insulting and threatening him. Afterward, he was overcome by the despair and tension and reacted negatively to the whole Curva, who answered accordingly. The striker stated that he didn’t distance himself from the rest of the squad and the regret shown for dropping two more points at home. The striker kept his aplomb from the penalty spot at the spot, preventing the Bianconeri’s first defeat in Serie A. He’s up to 11 goals and 2 assists in the season. They have enough problems on the pitch already, so they’d gladly avoid some off-the-drama involving the supporters, especially in a trying moment for the squad and a time when the relationship was improving after rocky years under Andrea Agnelli.

Juventus midfielder Weston McKennie is known for many things. From his Harry Potter-inspired goal celebrations to his ability to win back the ball on the counter, McKennie has been an integral part of both the Juventus and USMNT rosters for the last half-decade. In his time, the Texan has been part of teams that have won three CONCACAF Nations League titles, two Coppa Italia trophies, and a Supercoppa victory alongside the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, Giorgio Chiellini, and Alvaro Morata. And now he’s taking his efforts off the pitch. Last month, he announced “McKennie’s Magical Youth Mission” via his Instagram account. The organization’s purpose is to create a positive impact on underserved communities, with a special emphasis on orphanages. Through building educational and career pathways, the mission dedicates itself to creating a meaningful difference in the inner city, while tackling socioeconomic gaps. Ever the Harry Potter fanatic, so much so that he bears a lightning bolt tattoo on his hand, McKennie channeled his obsession with the franchise into something very positive. The mission’s first event took place in Miami, and found its sponsorship partners in Puma — Serie A’s technical partner since 2022 — and Vicky, a Cuban bakery that has long been a fixture in Florida, starting in Miami in 1972. McKennie’s Magical Youth Mission will host a number of events in the future, spanning from celebrity golf tournaments and soccer matches, holiday toy drives, and fundraising galas. However, the giving does not stop there, as the organization also focuses on providing underserved youth and orphanages with event and travel experiences. These youths will be given the opportunity to attend local Major League Soccer matches, Broadway performances, magic shows, plus transportation and tickets to Universal Orlando’s Wizarding World of Harry Potter. Lastly, the foundation will organize donations of shoes, athletic wear, and kits to orphanages. The foundation’s mission statement reads: “This non-profit organization will aim to bring elements of magic, joy, positivity, healing and motivation to children at local orphanages around the country in the form of love, laughter, financial support, and fantasy entertainment.” Always an inspirational force on the pitch, and all around good-guy comedian off the pitch, it is great to see that Mckennie has found a new and exciting purpose in providing magical experiences to those who would not be afforded the opportunity otherwise.

After the run of five consecutive defeats which had thrown their season into turmoil, it seemed Pep Guardiola's side were taking an invaluable step to getting back on track, just in time for their Premier League showdown with leaders Liverpool on Super Sunday. The Manchester City manager's confidence was such that he had just made a triple change, withdrawing Nathan Ake, Ilkay Gundogan and Phil Foden for some hard-earned rest and giving minutes to Kevin De Bruyne, James McAtee and Jahmai Simpson-Pusey. An uneventful conclusion beckoned. Or at least that's how it felt. Instead, a bewildering 15-minute collapse, the latest by any side with a three-goal lead in the history of the Champions League, a competition City won only last year, means they will head to Anfield on the back of their most painful result yet. And that is saying something coming three days after the heaviest home loss of Guardiola's career against Tottenham. Stream Sky Sports on NOW Download the Sky Sports App Get Sky Sports on WhatsApp! Live football on Sky Sports this week It all changed in an instant. And as against Spurs on Saturday, it started with a Josko Gvardiol error. Simpson-Pusey's header, after Manuel Akanji had half cleared an attempted long pass, was awkward for the Croatia international, who had Feyenoord forwards applying pressure either side of him, but he still should have been able to deal with it. Instead, his horribly-misjudged pass-back looped agonisingly into the path of Anis Hadj-Moussa, who got there well before the stranded Ederson, to touch the ball around the goalkeeper and slide home a smart finish from an acute angle. It was the latest in a series of costly defensive errors from Gvardiol, who was at fault for Spurs' second goal as well as their opener. Soon, what looked at first like a consolation goal for the visitors came to mark the start of an epic collapse. Seven minutes later, the deficit was cut to one goal and the alarm bells were ringing loudly. City had eight defenders either in or just outside their penalty area when Igor Paixao received Hwang In-Beom's pass near the right-hand corner of the box and yet both players found ample space. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player McAtee was too late in getting the right side of the latter, while Bernardo Silva's attempt to stop the former's cross was half-hearted, giving him the freedom he needed to lift a diagonal delivery towards the far post, where City were disorganised. Gvardiol had been late to spot Quinten Timber over his shoulder, while, on the outside, Matheus Nunes failed to track Jordan Lotomba altogether, allowing the right-back, who had come on as a substitute only 10 minutes earlier, to volley the ball towards goal from near the byline. At his near post, Ederson seemed to be caught off-guard, sticking out a leg and sending the ball crashing off the upright and across goal, where a sleeping Akanji had left the unmarked Santiago Gimenez with the easy task of chesting the ball over the line. City looked shell-shocked at this point. Feyenoord, meanwhile, clearly sensed their opportunity. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Their third goal was probably the worst of the lot from a defensive perspective, coming as it did from a Hadj-Moussa ball over the top from an innocuous position, 10 yards inside his own half near the right-hand touchline. In the penultimate minute of normal time, needing to simply play it safe and see out the closing stages, City were instead pushed up towards the halfway line. Their ragged defensive line was gleefully exploited. Hadj-Moussa could have aimed his pass towards any one of four Feyenoord runners, but Paixao was the one he opted for. Ederson came steaming out of his box in an attempt to clear the danger but got nowhere near it. The winger, like Hadj-Moussa before him, had numerous targets to aim for with his subsequent cross. Hwang, Gimenez and Timber were all racing into the box untracked, with City players far too slow to get back. In the end, Paixao picked the onrushing left-back David Hancko, who had sprinted freely into the box from the opposite flank to meet his team-mate's cross with an easy headed finish, sparking jubilant Feyenoord celebrations and ensuring their stunned hosts hit a new low. Guardiola was at a loss to explain the collapse afterwards. The game was good for the confidence, we were playing at a good level, and then when the first thing happens, we have problems, he said. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player He bemoaned a lack of focus. It's not about not running or no commitment, but in football you have to be [switched on] in certain moments to do it. City, once again, where found wanting in those moments and the errors continue to stack up. According to Opta, they have already made more mistakes leading to goals than in the whole of last season. They are more than halfway to matching last season's total for errors leading to shots. They remain glaringly vulnerable to quick, direct attacks but Feyenoord's three goals all came in different circumstances, underlining the scale of City's problems right now. Fail to stamp out the issues at Anfield on Sunday and this extraordinary run is likely to continue. This was a draw that felt like a loss and leaves their season at risk of imploding.

It was an extraordinary collapse, a draw that ends their five-game losing streak but will feel like a defeat given the remarkable circumstances. City remain outside the top eight in the Champions League. More worryingly, the slump in form shows no signs of ending. It had looked likely to be a routine win, a confidence-boosting result to get City back on course after their recent malaise. This result will only add to the questions facing Guardiola, a hapless collapse that suggests this team has lost what it once had.

It is what it is. It is difficult to swallow right now. The game was good, scored three, could have scored more. We give away three, especially the first one. We were not able to control the last minutes. The team was so committed. But the moment something happens, the team is not strong enough. We are not able to win games. We were always a team that found a way. What can we do? Rest one or two days and prepare for Anfield. Asked about the boos from the crowd at the final whistle… The last game against Tottenham, 0-4, they were there, applause. They don't come here to remember the past, they come here to see the team perform. Of course, they are completely right to express how they feel. Feyenoord head coach Brian Priske speaking in the press conference… If you are from Feyenoord Rotterdam, it is an unbelievable evening, 3-0 down away from home against, for me, still the best team in the world. Obviously you always believe, but it was a difficult game. The first 25 minutes, they played fast football, we were not as tight as we wanted, ended up too low. At 3-0 down, you definitely think this is going to be long night, tough evening, but without any tactical [changes], just individual quality, moments, gave us the draw.

So what have we learned about the new format? UEFA tore up the rulebook at the start of this season, ditching the traditional eight groups of four in the group stage with a new 'Swiss-style' 36-team league format. The top eight sides in the league will qualify automatically for the last 16, while the teams finishing in ninth to 24th place will compete in a two-legged play-off against each other to join the top eight teams in that round of the competition. Several voices within Sky Sports debated the topic of whether the new format is working ahead of matchweek three - but one aspect which is now becoming more intriguing is the extent to which the current league standings is reflective of the difficulty ranking of fixtures for each of the 36 teams involved. Many onlookers have already been sold, advocating the notion of not playing the same team twice, and pointing to the surprise results - namely Sporting's win over Manchester City, Lille's victory over champions Real Madrid and Aston Villa's triumph over Bayern Munich - as evidence in favour of the new format. Paris Saint-Germain have the hardest Champions League fixtures in Pot 1 based on the average UEFA coefficient of the teams they drew. Average coefficient: 69.625 across the eight games. Teams drawn: Bayern Munich, Manchester City, Atletico Madrid, and Arsenal. The coefficient rankings are based on points gained by clubs in the Champions League, Europa League, and Conference League over the past five seasons: Points: Two points for a win, one point for a draw, and points are halved in the qualifying rounds. Bonus points: Five bonus points for making the last 16 of the Champions League, and one more point for each further round. It has led to a scenario where Madrid - beaten at home by AC Milan last time out - face increasing jeopardy over their participation in the knockout rounds, especially if they were to be on the end of a bad result again away to Liverpool this week. Madrid were in fact handed the easiest draw among the Pot One clubs, with an average coefficient of 56.000. Champions League fixtures Champions League results Get Sky Sports Get Sky Sports on WhatsApp! But that puts even more scrutiny on comparing just how difficult one team might have it compared to another side, who might even have been in Pot Four and not participated in a previous Champions League. So, looking back to September, who got a touch when the draw was made? Well, based on the average five-year coefficient, Feyenoord were handed the stiffest set of eight games to negotiate. The Dutch club - who finished second in last season's Eredivisie - didn't get off to the best of starts, losing 4-0 at home to Xabi Alonso's Bayer Leverkusen. Faced with an uphill struggle to even gain qualification for a play-off spot, Feyenoord have rallied to earn victories away at Girona and Benfica, before their progress was derailed by a disappointing 3-1 home defeat by RB Salzburg. The stunning comeback to draw 3-3 at Manchester City means their hopes are in the balance, with home encounters with Sparta Prague and Bayern Munich to come before finishing off at Lille. Of the top 10 teams to statistically have the toughest set of fixtures, only Inter Milan currently sit inside the top eight. Five of them are currently in the elimination spots between 25th and 36th. Conversely, if we look at the teams with - on paper - the kindest schedules, what is noticeable is that No 1 ranked Young Boys have lost all five of their games so far - but they still have away trips to Stuttgart and Celtic sandwiched in between a home tie and Red Star. In the previous format, losing your first five games would certainly mean elimination, but the Swiss side could still finish inside the top 24 teams based on having games against relatively modest opposition. The same can be said for current Austrian champions Sturm Graz, positioned one place above them but also on zero points from four games. Is this what the new format intended to create? More games that matter? Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player There are other teams who have wasted no time in taking advantage of favourable fixtures. Aston Villa won their opening three games before falling to a disappointing 1-0 defeat at Club Brugge last time out. But victories over Young Boys, a weakened Bayern Munich and Bologna have put Unai Emery's side in a strong position to reach the play-offs at the very least. Of the 10 teams to have the statistically easiest run of fixtures, three sides sat inside the coveted top eight spots heading into the matchweek - Villa, Monaco and Borussia Dortmund. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Atalanta are unbeaten and have now moved inside it, along with Arsenal. In Celtic's case, the Scottish champions have won twice as many games as in their last two group stage appearances combined. Brendan Rodgers' side will be confident of earning a play-off spot given their kind run of games - with a home tie with Club Brugge and a trip to Dinamo Zagreb next - and that's despite a 7-1 trouncing in Dortmund. Hosting Young Boys after the Christmas break almost feels like an unnecessary safety net.

Talk of the unknown in these opening rounds has always been prefaced with a longing for a frenetic final set of games all played at the same time. Football's very own NFL RedZone. But the sceptics will always point towards the early lack of jeopardy, where weakened sides have tarnished supposed blue ribbon events. Liverpool's blistering start has made the visit of Real Madrid this week by far the least important of their priorities. No one at Arsenal - having lost title ground in the Premier League - talks now of the time they beat Paris Saint-Germain, whose struggles were expected based on having the fourth toughest set of fixtures - despite reaching last season's semi-finals. The Ligue 1 champions have been faced with an average coefficient across eight games of 69.625. The dream of lifting the Champions League trophy has never felt so far from becoming a reality under their Qatari owners, largely based on how they have performed, but partly as a result of who they have played and because three of their remaining four games are away from home. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Another discussion that will soon emerge is whether it matters if a team finishes first or eighth in the automatic qualification spots. Similarly, if finishing ninth is any different to finishing in 24th. The answer is 'yes'. To try to ensure every game matters through to the final day, UEFA has connected a club's final league placing to the knockout bracket, meaning where a club finishes affects their path. The higher you are placed, the easier the route (based on league ranking) through to the final. For instance, clubs ranked 1-8 will play the second leg of their last-16 tie at home. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player If a team finishes in ninth position, the disappointment of narrowly missing out automatically advancing to the last 16 could be softened by being drawn to face the team that finished in 23rd or 24th position. Likewise, teams who finish in first and second cannot play each other until the final; those who are third and fourth would avoid first and second until the semi-finals. At this stage, teams will solely be focused on collecting as many points as possible but given how everything is inter-linked, there could come a point where managers start to plot the best path to the final. For now, those permutations are for another day, but the opening four rounds of fixtures have certainly raised questions over whether the new format has created an unfair playing field. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player A new format brings new expectations in the Champions League this season, with clubs looking at the mathematics to see how many points they would need to qualify for the knockout rounds in the league phase structure. The Opta supercomputer believes 16 points from a possible 24 - so five wins and a draw from eight matches, or other combinations - would almost certainly be enough to finish in the top eight, which guarantees you a last-16 spot in the New Year. The data also believes 15 points - so five wins from eight games, or other combinations - could be enough to sneak into eighth place, with that points tally being enough in 73 per cent of Opta's 50,000 simulations of the league phase. Fourteen points, so four wins and two draws or other combinations, is unlikely to be enough for a top-eight finish - so the race to five wins is likely to be the target for the biggest sides. To finish in the top 24, which guarantees you a play-off spot at least, Opta believes 10 points - so three wins and a draw, or other combinations - will almost certainly guarantee you a place in that round. It means teams who win in the opening round of Champions League fixtures need just seven points from the remaining seven games to guarantee themselves a play-off spot. Nine points - so three wins from eight games, or other combinations - could be enough to finish 24th, with that points tally being enough in 69 per cent of the simulations. But just eight points - so two wins and two draws, or other combinations - runs the risk of elimination, with that points tally being sufficient in just 16 per cent of the simulations. Teams will be targeting at least three wins from eight to give them the best possible chance of reaching the Champions League knockout rounds.

The former Waasland Beveren head coach beat the likes of Bayern Munich’s Vincent Kompany, who came in second place. Timmy Simons, who earned promotion with Dender before moving to Westerlo in the summer, came in third place, The Raymond Goethals trophy is awarded to the best Belgian head coach of the calendar year. It has been quite the year for Hayen, who was managing the Club second team for the opening few months of the year. However, after taking over from Rony Deila, Hayen guided Club to the semi-finals of the conference league and turned their season around domestically. Thanks to the play-offs, Club still had an outside chance of the title despite finishing well off the pace. Hayen guided the side to an excellent play-offs that saw them surge to their 19th league title in the sides history. Kompany’s appointment at Bayern following his time with Burnley and Anderlecht certainly raised a few eyebrows this summer. The former Manchester City captain has guided the Bundesliga side to the top of the table in Germany, with 10 wins, three draws and one defeat so far this season. In Europe, the side have won four of their six games and sit just outside the top eight in the Champions League. GBeNeFN | Ben Jackson @2023 - All Rights Reserved. Get Football Group"

In the end, it was Club Brugge who came out on top against the league leaders with a 2-0 win. Speaking after the game, Genk head coach Thorsten Fink was quick to praise the opposition. The former Sint Truiden head coach said ‘We knew that we were facing the team that is currently the strongest in the country’. Fink also went on to say how the form that Club Brugge have shown in Europe is a good thing for Belgian football as a whole, and also credited their ability to win the big games as coming from their experiences in Europe. Yet, as Het Nieuwsblad also reported, Fink also wanted to point out that the game could have been different. Genk could easily have taken the lead in the second half when Tolu Arokodare was fouled in the area. However, the Nigerian striker saw his penalty saved by Simon Mignolet. This led to many question why the forward was taking the penalty when Jarne Steuckers had been the regular taker so far this season. Fink said of Arokodare ‘He is on the list with Steuckers. If he is not feeling one hundred percent, it is up to Tolu. He also scored convincingly from the penalty spot in a practice match’. The result means that Club close the gap on the league leaders to just a single point as the winter break approaches. Both sides face tricky games next weekend against sides from Brussels. Club will face Union away from home while Genk will welcome Anderlecht. GBeNeFN | Ben Jackson @2023 - All Rights Reserved. Get Football Group"

The Belgian champions all but secured their passage through to the next round with a 2-1 win over Sporting at home. Danish midfielder Casper Nielsen came off the bench to grab a crucial goal with almost his first touch of the game. Club went behind early as they appeared happy to sit back against their Portuguese opponents. After an initial shot by Maximiliano Araujo hit the post, Mozambique winger Geny Catamo was on hand to tuck home the opener. However, Club have been resilient in this years competition and fought back. Andreas Skov Olsen did well out wide and his pull back found Greek international Christos Tzolis. The former Norwich man saw his shot deflect off of Eduardo Quaresma and into the back of the net. Sporting could easily have had a penalty, but VAR decided that the tackle from Maxim De Cuyper took place outside of the box. Sporting then lost Quaresma just before half-time after a clash of heads with Tzolis. Just before half-time the Greek forced goalkeeper Franco Israel into a point blank save after a fantastic pass in the box from Hans Vanaken. Nicky Hayen then brought on Casper Nielsen with just under 10 minutes to go. The 30-year-old latched onto a Hans Vanaken pass just a few minutes later to slot home the winner for the Belgian side. The win means that Club have won three of their six games in the newly revamped league format and sit level on points with Sporting on 10. With Manchester City and Juventus to come, this really was a crucial win for the side as they hope to make the next round. GBeNeFN | Ben Jackson @2023 - All Rights Reserved. Get Football Group"

The side have made plenty in transfer sales in recent years thanks to some young talent. Ecuadorian defender Joel Ordonez looks set to be the latest to bring in large sums to West Flanders. As reported by Het Nieuwsblad, the likes of Chelsea and Liverpool have shown interest in signing the 20-year-old. However, while a winter transfer is possible, head coach Nicky Hayen would rather it was delayed a few months. Speaking ahead of the sides clash with Sporting in the Champions League, Hayen said ‘When that transfer will happen, you can’t control that. It could be in the winter, but it could also be after this season, which we would prefer’. There are other sides outside of the two Premier League sides that are interested, with some already in contact with Club Brugge over the signing of the defender. It is likely that, if possible, the side would try and keep him in Belgium on loan if a big fee were to be agreed this winter. Ordonez has played 18 times for the side this season, scoring once. 12 of these appearances have been in the Pro League, while a further five have come in the Champions League. The young defender joined Club Brugge as a teenager in 2022 from Ecuadorian side Independiente del Valle. He has already been capped by Ecuador at senior level.

In their five games so far, the side have won two, drawn one and lost two. Even in their defeats, the side have played well. They now face a Sporting CP side with one of the hottest strikers in world football. A win would draw them level on points with the Portuguese side and cement their position in the top 24, while also giving them a chance of making it into the top eight. Club come into the clash off the back of a late win over KV Mechelen. Despite conceding in injury time, the defending Belgian champions then rallied to get themselves back in front late on. They can ill afford such late game drama against this Sporting side. Club also need to ensure they are more efficient in European competitions. They could have easily beaten Celtic if they had taken their first half chances, while their victory over Sturm Graz could also have been more convincing for the same reason. In the striking department, the side can at least count on the return of their Swedish striker Gustaf Nilsson. Sporting are averaging two goals per game in the competition this season, winning three of their five matches. This included a 4-1 win over Manchester City with a hat-trick from Viktor Gyökeres. The 26-year-old has already scored 17 league goals in just 13 games this season, with another five in the Champions League. However, the side did suffer a defeat last time out in the competition when they lost 5-1 to Arsenal. They have since lost 1-0 to Santa Clara and 2-1 to Moreirense. Sporting finish their Champions League campaign against RB Leipzig and Bologna, while Club face Manchester City and Juventus. GBeNeFN | Ben Jackson @2023 - All Rights Reserved. Get Football Group"

Mechelen have only lost twice at home in eight games, scoring a league best 22 goals in those matches as well. However, the side have only won one of their past five matches, which came at home against struggling Beerschot. Club, on the other hand, are unbeaten in their last nine matches in all competitions. Mechelen are coming into this clash off a disappointing week. They lost 3-1 away in Kortrijk before being dumped out of the cup on penalties by Beerschot. The side are usually a strong cup team and would have fancied having a crack at the trophy once again this season. They have done well against Club Brugge in recent times, drawing the last three matches between the two sides. Benito Raman has been in great form for the team, with four of his five goals for the side coming in his past five matches. Club have scored 11 goals in their past two league matches and have the best away record in the league. They side have won four of their eight games, losing just two.

The former Celtic, Manchester City and Hertha Berlin defender has been out of favour for months now, being forced to train alone and not allowed contact with the first team. Boyata explained the situation ‘They want me to change in a small room where the cleaning crew keeps their stuff. I refuse. I pick up my clothes there and just do it in the locker room. And because I’m only allowed to train in the afternoon, I can’t eat at the club anymore. That way they want to make sure that I have no contact with my teammates in any way. It’s like I have a hyper-contagious disease‘. The experienced defender went on to say how he is not even allowed to play for the sides second team, Club NXT, who participate in the Belgian second tier. He is also not allowed to take part in friendlies. Boyata was clear in how he feels about how he has been treated, telling Sporza ‘The way I’m treated is disrespectful to me. Should I feel valued because I can still use the club’s facilities? They say they respect me, but that doesn’t show in the way they treat me’. Yet for the football team, the situation is clear. Boyata is one of the highest earners at the club and has not lived up to that on the pitch. His performances since joining from Hertha Berlin in 2022 have not been at the level many would have hoped, with him now slipping further and further down the pecking order. The side came out and said that they offered Boyata a contract termination in August, with 20% compensation of his reported €3m per year deal. However, Boyata refused that as he did not want to go abroad. The side have also stated that Boyata knew the situation all summer and that he was allowed to train with the first team and take part in pre-season friendlies to help find a move. By September, as reported by Boyata, the club offered a compensation of 55-60%. Again, the defender refused this. His reasoning was that he would have had to go to Saudi Arabia or Turkey, while he also would not have been eligible to sign for another team until January, something he claims Club Brugge did not realise. Now it appears that Boyata will have to see out the current situation until his contract expires in the summer. Club would clearly love to sell him, perhaps even allowing him to leave on a free in January. Whether he will be willing to take a reduction in wages to do so will certainly influence who many sympathize with in this saga. GBeNeFN | Ben Jackson @2023 - All Rights Reserved. Get Football Group"

Charleroi are certainly one of those sides, as they slip further into trouble. Club Brugge will hope that Union can do them a favour against Genk to close the gap at the top. Sint Truiden v Mechelen A frustrated Sint Truiden welcome Mechelen to the Stayen on Friday evening. The side were wrongly denied an equaliser against Standard Liege last weekend as a good run of form came to an end. Mechelen rescued a point late on in their game last weekend against Union. Last season the Canaries won all four games that the sides played against each other in the regular season and the play offs. Kortrijk v Antwerp Antwerp have been in good form against sides that are not considered to be title challengers this season. Kortrijk are certainly a side they will fancy their chances against. Despite a win over Beerschot, the side were lackluster against Anderlecht last weekend a rarely troubled Colin Coosemans in goal. The side are yet to reach double figures for goals this season, whereas their opponents already have 25. Dender v OH Leuven Dender are struggling after a decent start to the season, with just one win in their last five. OH Leuven have also only won noe of their last five in the league. Both sides recent wins were against Charleroi, and both would have circled this one as a winnable game when the fixtures were announced. OH Leuven should have taken a point or three at home to Club Brugge last weekend, whereas Dender are also struggling to convert chances. This could be a low scoring affair. Charleroi v Westerlo Charleroi are in a terrible state. The side are spiralling into a relegation battle and now welcome Rik De Mil’s former side Westerlo on Saturday evening. Fans are already planning a 12 minute protest prior to the game, not entering the stadium until the 13th minute. The side have looked beyond poor in their last few games, whereas Westerlo have performed well even without getting many points, apart from lats weekend against Dender. They will fancy heaping more misery on the Zebras this weekend. Cercle Brugge v Anderlecht Anderlecht travel to Brugge with a growing injury list. Neither Ludwig Augustinsson nor Leander Dendoncker travelled to Latvia for the Europa League clash with RFS. Both sides drew their European matches during the week, with 10 man Cercle holding out against LASK in Austria. Anderlecht looked to have secured a late win over RFS, only for a Moussa N’Diaye own goal in stoppage time seeing them leave Latvia with just a point. Gent v Standard Liege Gent edged out Omonia Nicosia during the week thanks to goalkeeper Davy Roef. The goalkeeper might be busy against Standard, although their ability to take their chances has been lacking. Gent should, if they have any ambitions of challenging for the title, be able to beat a poor Standard side at home. However, the problems of inconsistency that have plagued the side in recent seasons appear to still be there in 2024. Union St Gilloise v Genk Genk are looking like the team to beat this season. They have won each of their last three games 2-0 and were comfortable in all of these. Union on the other hand are struggling. They played well against Roma in the Europa League, but could not grab all three points. Goals have been hard to come by for the Brussels based side, not something that Genk have struggled with. However, in the past, this is the sort of game that Union would rise to. Beerschot v Club Brugge Beerschot have a huge challenge on Sunday evening. Club Brugge were excellent in the week beating Aston Villa in the Champions League and will hope to coast through to victory over the basement side this weekend. Beerschot showed signs of life against Anderlecht a few weeks ago and have only lost one of their last five matches. Club, on the other hand, have won four on the bounce. Beerschot are already facing a gap of nine points to safety. GBeNeFN | Ben Jackson – Author of The Africa Cup of Nations: The History of an Underappreciated Tournament @2023 - All Rights Reserved.

This comes amid confirmation that Josh Acheampong has at last committed his long-term future to the Blues. Acheampong’s name has long proven a prominent one in the transfer headlines across the continent. This comes after the 18-year-old’s insistence on dragging his feet over renewing the terms of his contract with Chelsea culminated in Acheampong being banished from first-team and reserve team duties alike. A number of leading European clubs, in turn, quickly made their interest in his signing known, with the aforementioned Real Madrid at the front of the queue. As alluded to above, however, this week, any and all parties keen on Acheampong’s services have been dealt a decisive blow.

Attached are notes on some of the teams, and their tier ranking at the end. The Reds find themselves in an intriguing position under Arne Slot’s guidance. While their reactive style has produced impressive second-half comebacks, questions remain about their true mettle given a favorable home schedule. The team has found success in deliberately slowing their tempo - a pragmatic adjustment that better suits their aging squad. Key concerns hover over the horizon: Mohamed Salah’s contract situation looms large, with the Egyptian reportedly eyeing Saudi interest in the coming years. Robertson’s declining form has become a liability, though the team has managed to paper over these cracks for now. Trent Alexander Arnold may join Real Madrid next summer. This could be a last hurrah for Liverpool if key players decide to move on. Arsenal’s situation presents a fascinating case study in squad building and tactical evolution. Odegaard since returning from an ankle injury has not missed a minute of action and is being overplayed. Letting both Fabio Vieira and Smith Rowe depart while placing faith in the raw talent of Ethan Nwaneri has left them thin in crucial areas behind him. A few years ago, raising their floor rather than their ceiling with signings like Jesus, Zinchenko, Trossard, and Jorginho gave them a better team, but those same pieces aren’t taking them over the top. The squad’s workload distribution is also concerning, with eight of eleven starters logging over 32 league matches worth of minutes. Much like Jude Bellingham at Real Madrid, Bukayo Saka’s work rate and usage on and off the ball don’t seem conducive to a long career at the top. However, Arsenal will be in the mix among the Champions League contenders because of their incredible defense. Even before Rodri’s absence, cracks were beginning to show in City’s armor. The squad is showing signs of fatigue, lacking the explosive goalscoring that characterized their Sterling-Sane era, and lacking the perfectionism of the treble winning season. Foden’s finishing woes aren’t timely, but all of City’s players for years have been operating in an increasingly low-margin environment where every mistake carries heightened consequences. They got better at cutting their mistakes out entirely, until recently when the dam broke. The solution appears straightforward yet challenging to execute: rejuvenation. City’s roster needs an injection of youth, but like many dominant teams, they’ve fallen into the trap of strategic stagnation, where they tell themselves “Football is about the best players - if we don’t get our guy, we don’t get anyone” (cough cough Real Madrid have fallen into the same trap). City do have some upside going into the Spring, but we rank them in the bottom tier of contenders here. Michael Olise on the wing brings much needed creativity to a Bayern team that was struggling to get output out of Leroy Sane and Serge Gnabry. Combine that with Jamal Musiala and Mathys Tel making much needed leaps, and Pavlovic continuing to establish him in midfield, and you have a more formidable Bayern team than last season.

The Bhoys had to hold their nerve in a dramatic penalty shootout, with Kasper Schmeichel’s save from Ridvan Yilmaz teeing up Daizen Maeda to deliver the decisive spot-kick after Reo Hatate and Jack Butland converted. Normal and extra time couldn’t separate the sides as Celtic and Rangers battled out a six-goal contest that captured the imagination of Scottish football circles and beyond. Both teams utilised all five of their substitutes, though Liam Scales’ introduction to replace Celtic defender Auston Trusty was regarded as a brave call at half-time by supporters due to the unusual nature of the change. However, it was a choice that added a different dynamic to proceedings, and Mark Wilson honed in on Brendan Rodgers’ defensive line and where pros and cons can be found in the aftermath of last weekend’s drama. Speaking on the Go Radio Football Show, Wilson believes that Rodgers made a ‘brave’ decision to take off Trusty for Scales, but it worked out in the Bhoys’ favour as they marched on to cup glory. In addition, he also cast doubt on whether Celtic will dip into the market for defensive reinforcements as the club have enough diversity in options. He stated: “Firstly, I thought it was the right decision. I was surprised on Sunday at half-time when he took him off, but when I seen it unfold, I could understand why. I thought Trusty had a difficult first 45; he kept running into blind alleys and getting caught up in things, so I thought it was a brave decision and ultimately, it worked, if you like. “In terms of the longer-term plan and bigger picture of shoring up, I’m not so sure. I think they’re okay at the minute. When you go into the Champions League and you’re playing against better quality, of course you’re going to get undone and unpicked at times. “I think domestically, they’ve been sound. I thought Trusty and Carter-Vickers were certainly the partnership you would look to build on. Carter-Vickers will play in the big, important games; I think it’s only the ones on astroturf after a big Champions League game he will miss out on. “That’s what you’re going to have to deal with. I’m not too sure if he (Rodgers) will dip into the transfer market to add another defender because I think he’s got enough in reserve.” On that subject, there have been a couple of recent developments that may interest supporters regarding the Bhoys’ defensive line. Earlier today, reports started to circulate claiming Stephen Welsh and Maik Nawrocki could leave Celtic come January in search of regular football, which would pave the way for either a new backline addition or promotion of a development player. Furthermore, Dane Murray is set to be recalled from Queens Park and has interest from the Scottish Premiership and EFL clubs. Could his form be worthy of recognition? It remains to be seen, but he would help fill homegrown regulations. Lastly, there is the possibility that Celtic could sink in any potential earnings from departures to capture a brand new centre-half. Build-up to the January window is still in the early stages of formation, though it is beginning to heat up."

With the match poised at 3-3, Scales was booked for the offence and James Tavernier hit the resultant free-kick over the crossbar. With no further scoring at Hampden, the final was settled on a penalty shoot-out and Celtic prevailed after Kasper Schmeichel saved from Ridvan Yilmaz. Decisions will be wrong, that's a given, Maxwell told the Press Association without giving a specific answer on the matter. We'll eradicate them as much as we can. VAR has done that in a vast majority of cases. There are always going to be one or two that will fall out with that, because there's people involved and in anything that involves a person, there will be decisions that are incorrect. That's human nature. Celtic beat Rangers on penalties to win epic six-goal League Cup final Clement's phone 'overloaded with penalty' incident Maxwell added: This is the first time I've been asked this year about a VAR decision. It's not always been that way. Head of refereeing Willie Collum is expected to address the incident in his weekly VAR review on Thursday. Since Willie has come in, the transparency, the way he's dealt with things, has been a breath of fresh air, and made a real difference on and off the pitch and we want to drive that forward, Maxwell continued. Since football began, people have been talking about refereeing decisions, and we will talk about them forever more. And that's part of the game. There will never be a point where there isn't a contentious decision because people disagree on decisions. Rangers manager Philippe Clement called the incident - which took place early in the first half of extra time - a really decisive moment , going on to describe the absence of VAR intervention as weird .

But Celtic’s League Cup final win over Rangers at Hampden on Sunday was perhaps one of the great matches he has been involved in. Brendan Rodgers watched his side do it the hard way, but by the end of it all, it was well worth it and it’s something everyone associated with the club will remember forever. The usual trio started up front – Daizen Maeda, Kyogo Furuhashi and Nicolas Kuhn – with Forrest replacing the latter in extra-time. He didn’t have much to do, other than scream from the top of his lungs when Maeda scored the winning penalty and lift yet another trophy for his boyhood club. Forrest has now equalled Bobby Lennox as Celtic’s most decorated player of all time – 25 trophies to his name. Premier Sports presenter Connie McLaughlin, who interviewed Forrest on the pitch after the game, hailed his achievements as ‘unbelievable’ and how she doesn’t think she will witness it again in her lifetime. McLaughlin also revealed on Instagram that she interviewed the winger when he was 17 and now he has done it all with Celtic. “What an unbelievable achievement for this guy,” McLaughlin wrote. “Equaling Bobby Lennox as the most decorated Celtic player!! “Not sure I’ll see that again in my lifetime…I remember interviewing him at an event when he was about 17 and him talking about his hopes to achieve great things with the club! Think he’s managed it! “What a day! Congratulations to @celticfc as the @premsportstv Cup winners!!” A post shared by Connie McLaughlin (@conniehmclaughlin) Celtic are sure to win the Premiership title – they hold a nine-point lead over Aberdeen and are 11 points ahead of Rangers. You suspect that will be Forrest’s crowning glory and the moment he becomes Celtic’s most decorated player in history. After the game, the Scotland winger told McLaughlin on Premier Sports that, the older he has become, the more he has started to appreciate what he has achieved. “Delighted,” responded Forrest on how he is feeling. “Just buzzing for the boys. All the work they have put in and all the staff. Then, obviously, to the fans and how much it means to them as well. Just absolutely delighted. On equal with Lennox: “Oh, it’s unbelievable. When you are older, you really don’t take it for granted at all. “All the names up there, it’s amazing to be involved in that. But it just comes down to how good the team has been over the years and it has been so successful.” James Forrest reacts after winning another final with @CelticFC and equalling Bobby Lennox's record for most trophies won with the club in the process 🍀🏆 You don't take it for granted at all. All the names up there – it's amazing to be involved in that! 🗣️#PremierSportsCup pic.twitter.com/DLaMHdafUW"
9925,DF4EF746746934730F9CEEAAF76322F7,Paulo Bernardo clamps Rangers penalty claim as star highlights why Celtic 'deserved' cup glory,https://cdn1.67hailhail.com/uploads/18/2024/12/GettyImages-2187582396-1-1024x725.jpg,2024-12-18T13:30:00.000Z,67 Hail Hail,https://www.67hailhail.com/news/paulo-bernardo-clamps-rangers-penalty-claim-as-star-highlights-why-celtic-deserved-cup-glory/,"Controversy in the aftermath of a Glasgow Derby is nothing new to Celtic and contention is once again in the air after the Bhoys’ Premier Sports Cup final victory over Rangers. In a six-goal thriller full of drama at Hampden, the Bhoys eventually claimed cup glory in a penalty shootout courtesy of Daizen Maeda’s decisive stop-kick. On one side of Glasgow, the reaction to Celtic’s win over Rangers has been joyous. For the other half of the city, there has been much debate surrounding one particular incident that unfolded. Liam Scales’ tug on Vaclav Cerny has stirred controversy, with irate supporters on the losing side claiming that the offence happened inside the box. News has since come to light that Alan Muir and Frank Connor were stood down from officiating in Scottish Premiership fixtures this weekend. Fallout brewing after an intense derby is nothing new. However, there are two sides to every story, and Celtic star Paulo Bernardo has made it clear what he thinks of the key talking point. Speaking at the Celtic FC Foundation’s Christmas Party, Bernardo made it clear he is paying little attention to what may or may not have been on Sunday and has instead highlighted why Celtic ‘deserved’ to win the Premier Sports Cup. He stated: “We don’t focus on that decision. We just move forward now. We won the trophy after a very good game, and that’s all we think about. It was a difficult game on Sunday. “Both teams played well and it was a good game for supporters to watch. But we had almost 70 per cent of the ball and I think we deserved to win the cup. “In the final moments, we had the quality to win the game and the players did so well in the shootout. When it came to the big pressure moments, we delivered. Our objective was to win the trophy and we managed to do that.” On the face of it, there is not an awful lot you can expect the Celtic dressing room to say about one particular incident. They have just won the first available silverware of the season, which is far more important to them. While the headlines hone in on other matters surrounding the game, the Bhoys move on safe in the knowledge that they were the ones to get their hands on the trophy. Looking ahead, the next challenge is to see off Dundee United this weekend at Tannadice, which is their final assignment before Christmas and last away day of 2024. With Aberdeen and Rangers in action on Saturday, three points in the City of Discovery would be welcomed to ensure a healthy buffer is present at the top of the Scottish Premiership."
9925,1D30233926853BFCEBF3E65983AB1AC4,'Are looking': Peter Grant's intriguing Kieran Tierney theory on Greg Taylor's Celtic contract,https://cdn1.67hailhail.com/uploads/18/2024/12/GettyImages-2190089608-1-1024x683.jpg,2024-12-18T13:00:00.000Z,67 Hail Hail,https://www.67hailhail.com/news/peter-grants-intriguing-kieran-tierney-theory-on-greg-taylors-celtic-contract/,"Greg Taylor’s Celtic future still hangs in the balance as the Scotland defender edges ever closer to entering the last six months of his deal. Taylor was a hero and villain in Celtic’s League Cup win after he was at fault for Rangers’ opener but redeemed himself in the second half with the Hoops equaliser. Brendan Rodgers has been urged to deal in the Celtic defender by former Hoops hero Chris Sutton but, as yet, there has been no contract signed. The Celtic boss has admitted that Taylor’s contract is a ‘priority’ at the club but with less than thirteen days to go until the Scotland fullback can start speaking to other clubs, the Parkhead support will be watching how this develops over the next two weeks closely. However, Peter Grant has another theory on why Taylor is yet to extend his Celtic stay and it’s all got to do with Arsenal defender, Kieran Tierney. Grant told The Go Radio Football Show [31m], “Listen, I’ve been really impressed with Greg [Taylor] and how he’s been going about his business and everything. “Everybody’s always questioning him. He’s come up with the goods. I know on Sunday he made an error and showed a bit of character to get the shot away for the goal. “Obviously, he needed a little bit of fortune. But I think he’s played the position exceptionally well, because it’s really difficult, it’s not just like your overlapped fullback nowadays.” “And maybe the other side of it is,” continued Grant, “Maybe Celtic are looking at the Kieran Tierney situation. “So if Alex Valle goes back [to Barcelona], Greg doesn’t sign his new contract, Kieran’s available when he comes back to Celtic. So maybe that’s a situation that’s getting mooted there. You never know how it’s working. “But I, for one, hope that Greg stays. Now listen, Valle would be pushing him all the way if he decided to stay, because he’s got the talent as well. I think he’s a very, very good player and I think he will only get better. “So he would push them all the way. So if that was the two fullbacks even getting into next season, I’d be comfortable with that.” Celtic fans have expressed their feelings on Kieran Tierney’s possible return to Parkhead with many saying they would welcome the deal but only if the Premier League defender improved his fitness. Arsenal supporters are swaying over Tierney’s future at the club with many unhappy at the former Celtic man being ignored by Mikael Arteta and others wanting the Scotland star to be given a chance. One thing is for sure if the opportunity presented itself, Kieran Tierney would love to return to Celtic. The stumbling block would be his massive Arsenal salary. If Celtic could get him back, even on loan, whether that would spell the end of Taylor’s Parkhead career or not remains to be seen but there are still many Hoops supporters who would love to see him stay at the club."

The Hoops stopper is currently at the centre of the Rangers penalty controversy after Scales was initially adjudged to have fouled Ibrox midfielder Vaclav Cerny outside the penalty box. However, the ensuing inquiry and rather public media meltdown over the affair has came to the conclusion that the foul by the Celtic defender was made inside the Rangers box and a ‘clear’ penalty kick was denied the Ibrox club. But that’s not what Scales reckons was the ‘mad’ part of the final as the Celtic defender opened up on how he really feels about the penalty win over Rangers the Ibrox club. Scales told The Herald, “It was mad. It’s always hard to control games, you know, cup finals at Hampden. “It was similar to the Aberdeen one we had last year. Just carnage. Both teams attacked, both teams were on the front foot. “It was probably a good game for neutral. There wasn’t probably as much quality as we would have liked from us, but we got over the line in the end. “I think that shows, you know. It’s almost like the win feels better when you’ve not played quite so well. We still got over the line.” “It was unbelievable,” continued Scales, “The way it finished, I wouldn’t have wanted it any other way, you know. To go and win on penalties makes it that little bit sweeter. I’m delighted. “There was a lot on the line. Obviously, it’s the first trophy available to us this year and we desperately wanted it. “So, we were really, really, really wanting to win the game and I think all the lads did brilliantly.” The game was packed with excitement, goals and had a a little bit of controversy thrown into the mix to make Celtic’s win over Rangers that little bit more memorable. Now that the first piece of silverware has been tucked into the Celtic Park trophy room, the Bhoys can now look forward to resuming league duty against Dundee United on Sunday to try and extend their lead at the top of the Scottish Premiership table."

Exits are in the pipeline, with Celtic trio Stephen Welsh, Luis Palma and Maik Nawrocki contenders to leave the club once the mid-season market opens for business. Brendan Rodgers will be keen to make room for incomings at the club to further their mission for domestic success and continental progression. Outgoings are required to make space for the squad to evolve. Earlier today, 67 Hail Hail told that Celtic have reignited interest in Royal Antwerp’s Michel-Ange Balikwisha after their initial admiration towards the former Belgium Under-21 international in the summer. With the transfer merry-go-round now in full flow, another development has come to light that could have implications next month. According to Daily Record, Celtic are likely to recall Dane Murray from his loan spell at Queens Park and several clubs have made ‘contact’ over a potential move for the Lennoxtown graduate. Scottish Premiership sides are circling for his signature, while there is also interest from League One and League Two outfits in England regarding his availability. Murray was sent out on loan to Queens Park after an injury-ridden couple of years at Celtic and has found his feet in Glasgow’s southside, registering one assist in 18 appearances. The Bhoys are now ‘considering their options’ in relation to the defender before coming to a decision on his future. If Murray were to be recalled by Celtic, it would remain to be seen if the Bhoys would take advantage of interest in his services or look to integrate him into the senior fold. As 67 Hail Hail already told supporters earlier on, homegrown star Welsh could leave the Bhoys for regular football and is expected to hold talks with the club over his future. Would that open up a slot for Murray to come in as an understudy within the backline? It’s not entirely out of the picture, but it remains to be seen. Cameron Carter-Vickers, Auston Trusty, Liam Scales and the aforementioned Nawrocki are also in the picture, so there is a lot of competition for places at this moment in time."

Going by how the media have played it and what pundits have said, you would think that Rangers won the penalty shootout and not Brendan Rodgers’ side. Rangers played out of their skin and Celtic weren’t at their best, yet it was Daizen Maeda striking the killer blow and winning an enthralling final for his side. But a lot of nonsense has been spouted post Hampden’s six-goal thriller. From Rangers’ penalty cries to non-stop talk about how Philippe Clement’s side played well, even though they headed back to Ibrox empty-handed. But Chris Sutton perhaps had to listen to the latest garbage being spouted about Celtic’s League Cup final win over Rangers. Celtic hold a nine-point lead over second-placed Aberdeen at the top of the Premiership – and Rodgers’ side have a game in hand. Added to that, they are a further 11 clear of Rangers ahead of their Ibrox visit on January 2, and that’s after winning the double last season. Now that the Treble is on for Celtic – and their domination continues – Ian Ladyman claimed that it would have been ‘handy’ for Scottish football if Rangers had won. But Sutton was having none of it and he slammed the suggestion by calling it ‘a load of rubbish’, including using Manchester City’s dominance in England as an example. Ian Ladyman claimed: “I personally think it would have been handy for the Scottish game had Rangers won that final.” Sutton screeched in embarrassment for his co-presenter: “Oooooh, what a load of rubbish. What an absolute load of guff. Why?” Ladyman responded: “If you want a one-team league rather than a two-team league,” Sutton then interrupted: “It’s a cup competition.” Ladyman added, with Sutton sighing in the background: “But you know that would have given Clement a bit of breathing space. It would have given Rangers a bit of confidence. It might have given them a bit of belief going forward. This is just going to kick them back in the opposite direction. If you think, by the end of the season in Scotland, it’s okay for Celtic to have won the league by 20 points, then that’s okay, with your Celtic hat on.” Sutton then made it clear: “It’s nothing to do with the Celtic cap. We congratulate Manchester City for however many years. You don’t bat an eyelid with that because it’s Celtic, who are now the most successful club in terms of trophies 119. But you have to earn the right. That’s what you have to do.” Forget about Rangers winning on Sunday to make it better for Scottish football, you could argue that Aberdeen are already doing that. Remember, they are the ones sitting second in the league and they have already beaten Rangers this season. Yes, their form has dipped and the gap is growing, but if they can pick up post-New Year, then things could become interesting near the top of the table. But, as of now, Celtic hold a comfortable lead at the top and they have some huge games coming up over this very busy Christmas period."

The Bhoys claimed Premier Sports Cup glory against Rangers last weekend and also find themselves top of the pile in the Scottish Premiership with just a few weeks to go until the market opens for business. Why is this relevant? Well, when pitting their prospects of further domestic silverware alongside still having a chance to secure Champions League knockout progression, you get the feeling these factors could entice new recruits. Brendan Rodgers has built a competitive environment for success at Celtic. However, his squad is always evolving, so exits in January are likely to make room for quality additions. In light of this, reports suggest three Bhoys could potentially be on their way out of the club come the January transfer window. According to MailSport, Celtic defender Stephen Welsh is set for talks with Rodgers over a potential move out of the club to claim regular minutes across the second half of the campaign. The Scot currently sits behind Cameron Carter-Vickers, Auston Trusty and Liam Scales in the pecking order and has made just one competitive appearance this term for the Bhoys. He has been kept around at Parkhead due to the homegrown quota but has received interest from France, Italy and England in recent years. Luis Palma and Maik Nawrocki are also believed to be ‘considering their options’ as outgoings begin to shape up ahead of the New Year. Quality over quantity has been a mantra Rodgers has long abided by since entering the Parkhead hot seat for a second time, which makes outgoings a key part of his mission. More than anything, maximising margins on sales is the main aim in this department, with fringe players holding the potential to inherit healthy fees, which, in turn, increase the possibility of January spending. The trio in question don’t look to have a prominent part in the long-term future of Celtic, so it makes sense to see if there are any suitors who could offer them a feasible way out."

The furore over Celtic defender, Liam Scales’ penalty challenge has caused a right good meltdown this week and has deflected not just heat from Philippe Clement but also publicity over what was one of the most thrilling cup finals in a generation. Celtic beat Rangers on penalties to lift the first piece of silverware of the season but instead of talking about the actual football, the penalty controversy has taken the shine of the game. However, it appears that there is a clear decision that Celtic never got after Peter Grant shared how he can’t believe Rangers weren’t shown a red card for a challenge by Jefte on Hoops winger Nicolas Kuhn. Grant was dumbfounded that the match referee and VAR never spotted Jefte’s studs raking the back of Kuhn’s leg in Sunday’s League Cup final. Grant told The Go Radio Football Show [13m], “I thought it was a red. I said at the time, I’ve played the game, so I understand exactly what he was doing. “He was doing a reducer. He’s quick. That’s what it was. He’s thinking to himself, ‘e’s quick. He’s going to run me. I’m going to make sure that he’s feeling something’. “And listen, we’ve all done it. “100%. Okay. I don’t know if it went to VAR,” continued Grant, “Obviously, I’m at the game and I didn’t know if it went to VAR. “But I know exactly what he’d done. He gets a booking for it. But he’s gone right down with his six studs, down his Achilles. And that is to slow you down. “There is absolutely no doubt of that. And you could see the look on his face right away. And you could see the look on one of his teammates. “I can’t remember what teammate looked at the referee right away as if to see what colour he was pulling out. I can’t believe that people never saw.” The game is over, Celtic have won but it seems that the game is now being spoken about for all the wrong reasons as the meltdown continues over the non-penalty award. Celtic have suffered their fair share of poor VAR decisions over the years and as the Parkhead fans are always told, these things, apparently, even themselves out over the course of the season. Celtic now have Dundee United on Sunday to look forward to as Brendan Rodgers looks to continued his charge towards the Scottish Premiership title."

Everyone has been used to Celtic looking and playing like they are a cut above the opposition, but they had to answer different questions at Hampden on Sunday. To be fair to all involved, despite the patchy nature of their display, even falling behind early on and letting two leads slip. Celtic deservedly beat Rangers on penalties and showcased a mental toughness and winning mentality that the opposition can only dream of. Brendan Rodgers made a change at half-time when he hooked off Auston Trusty for Liam Scales because he wasn’t happy with the team’s build-up play. But, inside the first minute, Mark Wilson noticed that Celtic were already making life difficult for themselves and it was proven by Reo Hatate’s actions. Even Callum McGregor admitted Celtic weren’t at their best and you sense the midfield was a big reason behind it all. Wilson shared that, inside the first minute, Hatate tried to control the ball near the corner and he proceeded to miscontrol it for a goal kick, as he told Open Goal. The Japan star played the entire game, including smashing his penalty kick into the corner during the shootout. “It must be a sickener for Rangers,” said Wilson. “Are you going to get Celtic as bad as that again? Probably not and you still can’t beat them. “Top players just gave the ball away time and time again. Hatate started poorly. Right from what was it the first minute, throw into Hatate’s feet in the corner, he goes to control it and it goes out for a goal kick. You are thinking f____ing hell.” Celtic have played non-stop since returning from the final international break of 2024 – and remember, Hatate was on international duty and had to travel across the world. There is no doubt that he is a key player for Rodgers and will continue to be that as the season goes on. But perhaps Rodgers needs to rest the 27-year-old, especially with Luke McCowan, who was cup-tied for the final, waiting in the wings and chomping at the bit to start. The games are coming thick and fast for the Bhoys, with Premiership action on top of Premiership action, before that Ibrox meeting with Rangers on January 2."

The debate rages on over whether Celtic defender Liam Scales’ shirt pull on Vaclav Cerny was worthy of a penalty as the Scottish media lose their minds over the incident. At first, there was a debate being had over whether the VAR panel had actually looked at the decision. That was firmly put to bed yesterday by 67 Hail Hail as we dug out the audio of Premier Sports confirming the Celtic decision was looked at by the video referees. With the SFA set to release the audio on the Celtic controversy on Friday, the national association have shown their hand early with a big decision on the weekend’s Scottish Premiership fixtures. It seems that the SFA have dropped a massive hint on what they think of the penalty debate after they took action on the VAR officials for this weekend’s Scottish Premiership fixtures. The Daily Record has shared how the SFA have axed VAR duo Alan Muir and Frank Connor from Scottish Premiership duty this weekend. The report says, “The pair haven’t been assigned any Scottish Premiership fixtures this weekend while the rest of the Hampden team of officials ARE all in action. “Beaton is in charge of Hearts vs St Johnstone while assistant David McGeachie is VAR assistant for Aberdeen vs Hibs and fellow assistant Jonathan Bell is running the line for the Friday night fixture when Motherwell host Kilmarnock.” So it seems that fans don’t really need to wait until Friday for the SFA’s thoughts on the penalty as it looks like their opinion on the matter is crystal clear. It wasn’t too long ago 67 Hail Hail wrote a piece on the five worst VAR decisions given against Celtic so what better time to review those to prove that Rangers are not the only club to suffer from poor match officiating. 🍀 It's not going to be utopia straight away, but it is moving forward… Dermot Gallagher says Matt O'Riley was unlucky to concede a penalty in Celtic's win over Ross County⬇️ pic.twitter.com/fImMOKbd69 ▫️ 'Zero consistency' in VAR decisions▫️ 'Zero chance' things will even out▫️ 'At least three major decisions' gone against CelticCeltic boss Ange Postecoglou has his say on the claims of handball against Connor Goldson at Ibrox and the use of VAR this season ⬇️ pic.twitter.com/9EAPhlQGi7 And the very worst decision of the lot:"

The Bhoys are now in the thick of their schedule and only have three matches left before the New Year, which they will see out having claimed every domestic trophy available. Transfer stories have already begun to do the rounds with the window approaching. Ajax midfielder Benjamin Tahirovic is on Celtic’s radar, but he also has interest from Serie A and the Greek top-flight. Intriguingly, the Bhoys could land Mahamadou Diawara for half-price amid Lyon’s financial problems that have alerted the Scottish Premiership champions. Brendan Rodgers has already claimed the first silverware of the season, but there is a real clamour for additions to add to his side’s Champions League prospects. Now, the Irishman appears to have reignited his interest in a winger that caught the eye during the summer window. According to MailSport, Celtic have reignited their interest in Royal Antwerp winger Michel-Ange Balikwisha after he returned to first-team action against Charleroi following a lengthy injury layoff. Recently, CEO Sven Jaecques spoke out on his future, stating: “Two clubs (Celtic and Rennes) kept negotiating to possibly still bring him in. “But, in the meantime, we know that such clubs will rather focus on January anyway. He must now return as soon and as fit as possible and then we will see what happens.” The 23-year-old was in outstanding form last term, registering ten goals and eight assists in 44 appearances across all competitions. Royal Antwerp have placed a £5 million price-tag on the former Belgium Under-21 international. In the summer, Rodgers spoke personally with Balikwisha about a Celtic move before it eventually broke down due to his muscle injury. However, the Irishman is keen to revisit the scene as quality reinforcements become the priority in January. Surprisingly, there weren’t any additions to the wide areas in the summer, but come the mid-season window, you suspect Luis Palma could be someone who looks to claim regular minutes elsewhere. Either way, supporters will need to wait and see how this story develops. Nevertheless, it is nice to know that the club is planning ahead."
9925,2C16465143C5D6C22A3EF86B3C3210BB,When Celtic and Rangers fans will get to hear the audio from League Cup 'penalty' incident,https://cdn1.67hailhail.com/uploads/18/2024/12/GettyImages-2156240883-1024x619.jpg,2024-12-18T08:30:00.000Z,67 Hail Hail,https://www.67hailhail.com/news/when-celtic-and-rangers-fans-will-get-to-hear-the-audio-from-league-cup-penalty-incident/,"The Hampden League Cup penalty furore is still hitting the headlines more than 48 hours after Celtic beat Rangers in the League Cup final. Whilst Celtic fans celebrate winning the League Cup, the Rangers support has been pouring over whether or not Hoops defender Liam Scales should have been penalised for a penalty box shirt tug on Vaclav Cerny. The Celtic defender believes it wasn’t a penalty as the foul happened outside the box and last night, 67 Hail Hail discussed how Premier Sports confirmed VAR did have a look at the Celtic incident and deemed John Beaton’s decision correct. As the debate rages on, Celtic and Rangers fans will never know how VAR came to their decision, until now. Gordon Duncan, who hosts the SFA’s The VAR Review show admits that he hasn’t yet heard the audio but discloses when the next episode of the show will be out. Duncan told Superscoreboard, “I think the real frustration is because people would like there to be a real explanation, even if you don’t agree with it, you want to hear something tangible. “And that’s the way Glasgow works. Minds then go to a real serious, sinister explanation. I genuinely don’t know. I haven’t heard the audio. “As fate would have it, I’m hoping I’m going to get the chance to hear it this week because the next VAR review with Willie Collum will be due in the next week or so. But I think in many ways, it’s going to be a letdown for everyone.” “Put it this way,” Duncan continued, “Have you met anyone who doesn’t think it’s a penalty? So I don’t really know what possible explanation there’s going to be, other than a VAR and assistant VAR, whatever, who just overlooks it. “Do you know what I mean? I don’t know what you call that, a loss of focus, eye off the ball, pardon the pun. “It’s, like I say, inexplicable is the word that most people are using for a reason.” The VAR Review show has been a welcome addition to the new season as the SFA look to bring transparency to how their officials reach decisions using video technology. The Scottish Sun has gone one better and said that the audio will be revealed on Friday when the next episode of the SFA show is due out. But what is clear is that no matter what reason they provide, the national association will never placate the Rangers fans who believe they lost the cup through some sense of injustice. Even Rangers boss Philippe Clement knows why Celtic won the trophy. His team were simply not good enough. As soon as the Rangers fans accept that and stop deflecting then maybe, just maybe, they can look at finding a way of bridging the gap which is getting larger by the season."

Last season, England also looked a stick-on for an additional spot following the group stages of the three continental competitions. But a poor performance across the knockouts left them third in the coefficient table. Only the top four finishers in the Premier League qualified for the Champions League as a result, meaning Tottenham missed out and entered the Europa League. England had finished in the top two of the coefficient table in six of the previous seven seasons but the Premier League suffered its lowest coefficient total since 2016/17 - and it would have been even lower but for the introduction of the Conference League in 2021/22. This time around, however, Chelsea have blown away all before them in the Conference League, while Liverpool have a 100 per cent record from their opening six Champions League games. Arsenal are in third, while Villa sit fifth with two league games remaining. Manchester United, meanwhile, are unbeaten in the Europa League - the same competition in which Spurs currently sit ninth. Of all the teams that are in danger of an early elimination, it is English champions Manchester City - currently 22nd in the Champions League standings and with work to do. Why exact league places matter in CL Champions League fixtures Champions League results Stream Sky Sports with NOW But according to Opta, England have an incredible 98.5 per cent chance at present of being awarded the coveted extra spot for the 2025/26 campaign - ahead of Italy and Spain. In the coefficient standings, a win is worth two points, a draw one and there are also bonus points for reaching certain stages of competitions. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player To achieve automatic qualification into the round of 16 in March, teams must finish in the top eight. Those who finish ninth to 16th will be seeded for the play-offs, so will have the second leg at home. Those from 17th to 24th will be unseeded, so have the first leg at home. Teams that finish anywhere from 25th to 36th will be eliminated from this season's competition, with no access to the Europa League. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Yes, it does. The final league position gives you a specific route - and specific opponents - in the knockout draw. The below graphic shows the tournament tree for the rest of the competition. For the first time, the knockout rounds are decided by the league phase - with no separate draws for the last 16, quarter-finals and beyond. For example, the teams that finish first or second in the league phase will face a team that finishes in 15th, 16th, 17th or 18th. Compare that to the team that finishes in seventh or eighth, who could play a team that finishes in 23rd or 24th - but also run the risk of facing the team in ninth or 10th spot - which could be a major European outfit. The advantage for the team finishing first or second is they will guarantee playing a team in the 'middle' of the final Champions League table. Finishing lower down runs the risk of playing a better side. Not necessarily. Particularly this season. The early struggles of teams such as Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain mean a top European side could end up in the 'middle' of the Champions League table - thereby coming up against one of the best-performing sides. Currently, Liverpool are top of the league table - but the teams who began this gameweek in 15th, 16th, 17th and 18th are Benfica, Monaco, Sporting and Feyenoord - with PSG, Real Madrid and Man City below those teams in the table. So if top teams continue to not do as well as expected in the league phase, it could create some blockbuster last-16 ties, thereby taking away the advantage of finishing in the highest possible spots. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Again, yes. A big one. And it's all to do with the play-offs. The new Champions League format means the team that finishes ninth faces the team in 24th in the play-off round. Tenth plays 23rd, 11th plays 22nd and so on. So if you just miss out on a top-eight finish, the blow is softened by playing the worst-performing sides that qualified from the league phase. So the higher you finish, the 'easier' game you get. But again, if teams such as Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain struggle in the league phase, you could have top sides meeting each other in the play-off rounds. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player The Opta supercomputer believes 16 points would almost certainly be enough to finish in the top eight, which then guarantees you a last-16 spot in March. Liverpool have surpassed that tally having won all of their six games so far, while Aston Villa are just one win away from that checkpoint. The data also believes 15 points could be enough to sneak into eighth place, with that points tally being enough in 73 per cent of Opta's 50,000 simulations of the league phase. Meanwhile, 14 points is unlikely to be enough for a top-eight finish. Arsenal are currently on 13 points, so victory over Dinamo Zagreb in their next Champions League game in January should seal a top-eight finish. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player To finish in the top 24, which guarantees you a play-off spot at least, Opta believes 10 points will almost certainly guarantee you a place in that round. Liverpool, Arsenal and Aston Villa have already reached that tally, but City and Celtic still have a bit of work to do. Celtic are currently on nine points after their goalless draw at Dinamo Zagreb, but City still lie on eight points with two matches to go. They face PSG and Club Brugge in those matches. Nine points could also be enough to finish 24th, in a boost to City, with that points tally being enough in 69 per cent of the simulations. But eight points runs the risk of elimination, with that points tally being sufficient in just 16 per cent of the simulations. The Opta supercomputer predicts Liverpool, Arsenal and Aston Villa are set to finish in the top eight, with Arne Slot's side staying top, the Gunners in third and Villa in seventh. On current form, Manchester City and Celtic are set to finish in 22nd and 18th. The supercomputer also says PSG are on course to finish 24th - avoiding elimination by the skin of their teeth. Liverpool are currently the favourites to win the Champions League, with Slot's side given a 20 per cent chance of winning the trophy in Munich after a stellar start to the season. Arsenal are third favourites with 13.2 per cent - just ahead of Pep Guardiola's Man City - fourth favourites on 9.3 per cent. Inter Milan are second favourites on 15.8 per cent - with Atalanta, Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Real Madrid, Bayer Leverkusen and Sporting making up the top 10. Aston Villa have a 0.6 per cent chance of winning the entire tournament, which is twice as likely as Celtic on 0.3 per cent.

Henry queried why Guardiola had allowed free-scoring players like Riyad Mahrez, Julian Alvarez and Cole Palmer to leave the Etihad without being replaced, and asked where goals would come from when Erling Haaland is not firing on all cylinders. City are on a run of eight defeats from their last 12 games following the 2-1 loss in Sunday's Manchester derby, which left them nine points off the top of the Premier League table, having played a game more than leaders Liverpool. Though they have struggled defensively in the absence of Rodri, Guardiola's side have also recorded comfortably their lowest goals-per-game tally of any season since his arrival. We all know, it's the first time and we're allowed to say it, that we can challenge his decisions in the way of letting Cole Palmer go, Riyad Mahrez, Julian Alvarez, Henry said. Ilkay Gundogan came back and it's not the same Gundogan who scored 17 goals a season. You're missing those goals. Erling Haaland is scoring the same goals, a few less than in his first season but he's doing what he does usually. Live Premier League table Stream Sky Sports on NOW Premier League fixtures Get Sky Sports I've seen him miss sitters in every season but where are the goals of Mahrez, Alvarez or Kevin De Bruyne, Gundogan - where are those goals? Henry said he did not expect Guardiola to quit, only weeks after signing a new two-year deal to take him through to June 2027, but defended the manager who he worked under at Barcelona in his first job for the level of consistency he has achieved since then. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player One thing I will say about this team, it's the first time it's happening like this to him in his career. Let's not kill the guy or this team because of what's happening, he said. You can never say never [that he could quit] - but Pep is not that type of coach. He is really, really hard, and mean and intense when you win, because he wants to keep you there. And he's more nice when he's down. You can see when the team didn't play well, he will come out and say 'I love my team, they played really well tonight'. And sometimes he will come on the pitch and have a go at his team when they won 3-0, you can see him arguing that someone who missed a pass. I like that. You change when you're at the top, you try to change so you can stay there. Once you are here, you're trying to be the nice guy now. Jamie Carragher added that City's problems only highlighted the level of rebuild required when their team evolution had appeared more seamless in previous years, despite having to replace club legends like Sergio Aguero, David Silva and Vincent Kompany across Guardiola's time at the club. He said: It's the first time it feels like a rebuild, even though there has been but they've been so successful they haven't missed the players you're talking about. This is something every club has gone through. You look at Jurgen Klopp a couple of years ago, Man Utd under Sir Alex Ferguson where you look at it and think it's going to take them a couple of years to get back to what they were. Because Pep is that good, you've never felt like it was a rebuild even though it was. Tom from Southampton became a millionaire for free with Super 6! Could you be the next jackpot winner?

INCIDENT: Liverpool defender Andy Robertson is shown a straight red card after bringing down Harry Wilson for denying an obvious goalscoring opportunity. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player DERMOT SAYS: I have had a lot of chances to look at this again and I did not think it was a red card at the time, and I still don't. Robertson doesn't know he's coming, he mis-controls the ball and Wilson nicks the ball. Is he in control of the ball? No. Is he going to gain control of the ball? Very doubtful because the Liverpool player is going to get their first. Is he moving towards goal? No. There's are too many variables and the 'O' [in DOGSO - Denying a goal or an obvious goalscoring opportunity] stands for obvious and not possible. Then (Raul) Jimenez has a shot and the whistle actually goes when (Virgil) Van Dijk clears the ball so it adds a lot of complications to it. A more palatable decision would have been a yellow card.

DERMOT SAYS: The pictures speak volumes and Craig Dawson does him [Ait-Nouri] a massive favour because he is so angry because that could have escalated to almost anything. Without doubt, the FA will be looking at this [Cunha's confrontation] this morning. He has elbowed the guy in the back of the head, then snatched his glasses off and it's not the reaction you expect from a player.

DERMOT SAYS: It was not a good advert for football, you should not be doing it [going down like Walker did]. I thought the referee [Anthony Taylor] did well, he did not get sucked into thinking it was something bigger than itwas, it was just a push. It was a player reacting to a push but we don't need that.

The defender goes to play the ball, Hojlund sees him coming and goes over himself and it looks so much worse in slow motion.

DERMOT SAYS: I think it's a foul [by Rogers on Anderson before he enters the box] and he [Anderson] then grabs hold of him going into the box. I think it's then a penalty but I think the best outcome here in fairness is the VAR to recommend to the referee to go to the monitor so he has all options open. He then would have seen Rogers ripping his [Anderson's] shirt right off his back and he can then give a free-kick [to Forest].

The referee has a good position and says it is no foul and play on and certainly not one for VAR - if you are interfering with that, then you are going to be looking at every single incident on the field.

The main news is that Joey Veerman and Jerdy Schouten will both board the plane. Schouten was reportedly ready for his comeback for PSV against Twente on Friday, yet didn’t make an appearance as Peter Bosz used up his substitutions at an early stage. While Veerman appeared for the second half in the 6-1 thrashing of the Tukkers, the Volendammer had already turned out against Utrecht a week earlier. PSV have no suspensions, although three of their players were booked against Shakhtar – they were their first cautions of the European campaign. If he appears, it should be the final Champions League game for Hirving Lozano in PSV colours. He will leave for America and the newly formed San Diego FC during the winter break. PSV selection: Walter Benitez, Joël Drommel, Niek Schiks, Ryan Flamingo, Mauro Júnior, Olivier Boscagli, Rick Karsdorp, Matteo Dams, Fredrik Oppegård, Armando Obispo, Malik Tillman, Guus Til, Joey Veerman, Jerdy Schouten, Ismael Saibari, Richard Ledezma, Johan Bakayoko, Luuk de Jong, Noa Lang, Hirving Lozano and Ricardo Pepi.

Cutting in from the left, Noa Lang beat Michal Sadílek well before placing an effort past low and hard past Lars Unnerstall’s stand-in, Przemysław Tytoń. On 34′, the hosts truly shifted the momentum as Malik Tillman emerged from a scrappy box to fire in a right-sided cross low off the right post. Ismael Saibari then aptly capped a flowing team move two minutes into stoppage time. Despite the interval arriving mercifully, Twente just couldn’t regroup and Saibari resumed the scoring on 54′ – firing into the bottom-left corner with aplomb after being played in by Ricardo Pepi. The latter’s USMNT colleague Richard Ledesma then made it 5-1 with a fine strike from a tough angle on the right, before Pepi himself rounded off a fine day with a stylish chip five minutes from time.

The attacking midfielder indicated last weekend that the ‘holy fire’ is lacking in him, which was fodder for various interpretations from opinionated pundits. These include Pierre van Hooijdonk, who noted that perhaps the midfielder should be sent away on holiday for two weeks. Opposing the outside influence, and noting the potential for things to spiral, Bosz quipped at his press conference: “On the one hand, I understand that there is speculation because he started it himself and could not get the time to explain it properly. On the other hand, I thought it was very dangerous what Pierre van Hooijdonk did, for example.” In other news, the Eindhoven coach also addressed the fitness of a couple of contentious faces in Joey Veerman and Jerdy Schouten ahead of the Friday night clash with FC Twente.

My heart was still in Barcelona and I could not really focus on the next thing, he reveals Comment and Analysis @ghostgoal Monday 11 November 2024 16:18, UK At 23, Sergino Dest has already experienced the highs and lows of football. After the dream move from Ajax to Barcelona came the mistake in Milan. He was then flying at PSV before an anterior cruciate ligament injury brought him down to earth again. Unfortunately, my life path went in a different direction to what it should be going, he tells Sky Sports. But the message from Dest is that the journey is not over. The talent remains and as he returns to full fitness, the ambitions for the future are still sky high. There is a World Cup in the United States on the horizon. That is going to be special. Before that, there is work to do in Eindhoven as PSV look to retain the Eredivisie title that Dest helped to win last season. From there, the plan is to get back to the big leagues. Obviously, PSV is a great club, but I have a lot of ambitions and I know what I can do. I feel that my level needs to be in the top five leagues, so I am working really hard for that. I have been in a lot of beautiful places. I want to get back to these beautiful places. In the meantime, he is working his way back and keeping busy. Always busy, man. He is speaking to Sky Sports fresh from opening a football court in his home-town of Almere, just outside Amsterdam. To the children there, his success is an inspiration. I had been thinking about this years ago, but I think this was the right time for me to do it. It is amazing to create your own legacy, putting my own field, my own name out there in the world. And the kids here, they love it. That it is something big and I am proud of it. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player It is an impressive sight in Almere. It is something new around here and I want to motivate them to go outside and play. It is not so long ago that Dest was the young boy out there honing his skills. Yeah, not so long ago, he agrees. But also a long time ago. Download the Sky Sports app Transfer Centre LIVE! Football features League tables around the world There it is, that sense of a career in flux. The skills that lit up those street games in Almere took him all the way to El Clasico and to a World Cup in Qatar, following his much-discussed decision to represent the United States instead of the Netherlands. Only now, given his injury, is he coming to terms with all that he won - and all that he lost. Dest achieved the dream absurdly early. Plucked from Erik ten Hag's Ajax, he found himself thrust into Barcelona's first-team alongside Lionel Messi while still a teenager. Now, he is readjusting to life back in the Eredivisie at a time when the expectation was that his career would be on the rise. He wants to go again, talks of being eager not to waste time because he can still improve. But memories of Camp Nou linger inside him. Looking back, it impacted his loan move to AC Milan. Milan for me was a big mistake. Obviously, it is a beautiful club but I was not ready at that time to go there, mentally. At that moment, my heart was still in Barcelona and I could not really focus on the next thing. I think that is why it went the way it went. Dest made only 14 appearances for Milan that season after what had been a whirlwind two years at Barca. Everything went really fast but I enjoyed every little minute of it. Going into that dressing room, playing against Real Madrid, winning the Copa del Rey. He can always say that he played with Messi during the legend's last ever season at Barcelona. I was not really thinking about it like that at the time, but that is crazy if you think about it. Seeing Messi and Antoine Griezmann work up close was an education. Watching them in training and in games, you try to improve your game by learning what that they do that make them so good. What, exactly? A lot of the time, it is by delaying. They see where they need to run or pass but it is different. They see the bigger picture. He explains: Sometimes if you delay the play, it looks like you are going to pass it but in the last second you change your mind, adjust your body and with one touch you pass it to the other player. That is unpredictable for the opponent and so difficult to defend. Dest has plenty of special skills of his own. Gary Neville once said that nobody grows up dreaming of being a full-back but Dest is no ordinary full-back. He is fond of getting his best bits clipped up for his social channels and takes pride in those flicks and tricks. Look, even with all these wingers, I can still make highlights videos - and I am a full-back! It is possible. And I enjoy it, he says. You can make every position a nice position. You just have to make it your own. I play with flair, I give it my own style. Obviously, I need to improve on certain things. I can be better. But I feel like the way I do it is about flair but it is also about being functional. You see, it is not that difficult for me to bypass a man. I feel like these tricks that people say are too much are okay because they are actually functional. It makes you creative. If you can create when the game is locked, your dribble can create that two vs one. Peter Bosz, the head coach at PSV who is doing such an impressive job, understands this. He just loves me as a player, man. He has a lot of confidence in me, he is patient and he trusts me. That is the best thing you can have. And he pushes me to the limits. Those kids in Almere were shocked when he chose to join PSV. They could not believe it! But Ajax were in no shape for him to return. It is a bit chaotic at the club and at this moment I have had enough chaotic. I need something stable and calm, he explains. Even so, there are fond memories of the famous old club, and words of support for Ten Hag, particularly his man-management skills after he gave Dest time off to decide his international future. He was very kind to me. I thought he was a really good coach. Dest settled on the United States, where his father was born, and remains utterly convinced it was the right move for him. That was the best choice of my life. I will never ever regret it. I have had so many beautiful experiences and I feel important there. It is a recurring theme of the conversation. After the rise and the feelings of rejection, there is the need to be valued. PSV was there in a difficult moment. They still had faith and believed in me, so that was important and I am really thankful for that, he says. It was difficult mentally because you do not want to go back to the Eredivisie if you have played for these big clubs. My mentality was that I was going to kill it and get back up again. But then, unfortunately, came the injury. It was all sunshine until the injury. I have an amazing season, became a champion and could not even play the last game where we became champions. It was frustrating. Since then, it has been a lot of hours in the gym to get every muscle to a strong level again. It takes time but it is going well. Maybe it is good for me to be stable at one club a little longer because I kept moving every year to another club. But I also do not want to waste time. I want to get the maximum out of my career. The message from Dest is clear. He is just getting started. I am glad that I had this path. I made a lot of mistakes that I will not make in the future. It is just all experience, man. I accept it. I cannot change it. This is just the path I have to follow at this moment. And better things will come. I know I am going to come back.

However, conversations with head coach Luis Enrique have revealed the manager has some reservations about the move. Meanwhile, SPORT claims that Barcelona are weighing a €70 million offer for Gyökeres. Their proposal could include a condition allowing him to remain at Sporting on loan for another season. In addition, CaughtOffside reports that Newcastle are prepared to pursue Gyökeres if Alexander Isak departs the club. However, this move is unlikely to materialize during the January transfer window. Arsenal reportedly see Gyökeres as a leading candidate to replace Gabriel Jesus, who has struggled with confidence this season, scoring just once so far. Martin Keown has suggested that Arsenal could make a significant investment in a new striker if their current forwards don’t improve. “The players who are there at the moment need to start scoring goals fast, don’t they? Otherwise, Mikel will put his hands in his pocket and buy a forward,” Keown told the Oxford Mail. When specifically asked about Gyökeres, Keown responded: “He’s not quick enough. And he wouldn’t have been quick enough in my day.” A recent report from TBR Football states that Gyökeres’ goalless outing against Arsenal hasn’t impacted the Gunners’ interest in the Swedish forward. They still regard him highly and see him as one of several strikers being considered to strengthen their attack next year. Furthermore, TEAMtalk recently revealed that Manchester United, Newcastle United, and PSG are the clubs most interested in Gyökeres, according to sources. Your email address will not be published.

The situation took another turn on Sunday when the French forward was left out of PSG’s matchday group against Olympique Lyonnais, sparking more questions about his role under Luis Enrique. Randal Kolo Muani has struggled to establish himself as PSG’s main striker, logging just 453 minutes across all competitions. His lack of game time has fueled rumors of a possible January departure. According to L’Équipe, a loan move—potentially with an option to buy—seems the most likely outcome. While Manchester United previously expressed strong interest, their priorities have shifted since Ruben Amorim’s arrival. RB Leipzig remains in the mix, though discussions are still in the early stages. Meanwhile, AS Monaco could emerge as serious contenders as they aim to bolster their attack following Folarin Balogun’s injury. GIVE ME SPORT reported on Tuesday, citing sources, that Manchester City are considering a loan move for Kolo Muani to bring him to the Etihad Stadium during the upcoming winter transfer window. The Sky Blues are exploring this option after failing to replace Julian Alvarez, leaving them without a backup for first-choice striker Erling Haaland. Le Parisien’s Benjamin Quarez and Marc Mechenoua report that Manchester United made inquiries a few weeks ago, with West Ham, RB Leipzig, and several Serie A clubs also expressing interest. Information indicates that a loan deal with a buy option is the most likely outcome. While no official asking price has been set, Transfermarkt currently values the forward at €30 million.

As the January transfer window nears, there’s information that 2025 could be the year the Magpies move off from the midfielder. GIVE ME SPORT reported on Monday, citing sources, that Tonali is genuinely seeking a move away from Tyneside. Furthermore, the information reveals that there is a growing possibility of Tonali sealing an exit in the summer instead of midway through the season. Newcastle secured Tonali from AC Milan in 2023 and signed him to a five-year contract until 2028 while paying a €70 million transfer fee plus add-ons for the Italian standout. In recent days, rumors have been swirling about potential signings for PSG. Now, a familiar name has resurfaced in the columns of La Gazzetta dello Sport (h/t Le10Sport). According to the Italian newspaper, PSG might once again be interested in Tonali, a player who no longer seems to be thriving at Newcastle. Sky Sports Switzerland (h/t Le10Sport) confirms the Italian midfielder’s desire to leave and reveals a major competitor for PSG in this transfer saga: Juventus. The Turin coach, none other than Thiago Motta, reportedly wants to make Tonali the linchpin of their midfield. The Italian club is said to have already contacted the player’s entourage.

The report noted that Reis is keen to move to Europe and fulfill his dream of playing in the Champions League. However, Palmeiras appears intent on keeping hold of their young talent for now. Meanwhile, ESPN Brazil reported that Manchester United, Arsenal, and Paris Saint-Germain are also keeping an eye on the 18-year-old. With Reis under contract until December 2028 and a €100 million release clause, a move in the near future seems unlikely. For now, Europe’s top clubs are expected to closely follow his development this season. ESPN Brazil has shared the latest update on the Reis situation, reporting that Brighton’s £20.7 million bid for the teenage defender has been rejected.

Transfer expert Graeme Bailey reports that Brighton are demanding close to £100 million for the forward, although they have no intention of selling him anytime soon. With Pedro under contract until 2028, Brighton hold strong negotiating power. This season, the Brazilian has made ten appearances, scoring four goals and adding three assists. Former Man United and Blackburn chief scout Mick Brown believes it will take a massive fee for Brighton to sell the player. Furthermore, Brown states that he doesn’t see Pedro as a fit for Liverpool. “Brighton are going to demand a huge fee for him,” Brown told Football Insider. “I’ve heard there’s some interest from Liverpool, but how far along that interest is, I’m not sure. I’d be surprised if it happens in January, given the money it would cost and the sorts of deals which usually take place in the middle of the season. “I remember watching Joao Pedro a lot when he was at Watford, and he’s certainly a talented player. I had doubts at the time about whether he would be able to step up to the real elite level, but he’s performing well for Brighton and clubs have been watching him. I must admit I’m still uncertain whether he’s the right fit for a side like Liverpool, but that will be up to their scouts to make their assessments.“ CaughtOffside recently reported that Liverpool and Arsenal are both preparing offers in the range of €55 million to €65 million for Pedro, with Manchester City also planning a move for the young striker. The report notes that Pep Guardiola and Mikel Arteta are among those who believe he could enhance their attacking options. Your email address will not be published.

Although de Jong is committed to staying at Barcelona, PSG’s history of signing players from the Catalan club makes them a potential destination next summer. PSG has strengthened their midfield in recent years with additions like Vitinha, Fabián Ruiz, and João Neves, fueling further speculation about de Jong’s future. Journalist Ferran Correas also suggested that Barcelona might be willing to sell de Jong next summer. However, Diario AS recently emphasized that the midfielder is very comfortable at Barcelona and has no intention of leaving, despite the club’s openness to receiving a substantial transfer fee for him. Barcelona have reportedly reached out to de Jong as part of their plans to start talks on new contracts, according to Sport. The club aims to prevent key players from entering the final 12 months of their current deals and is now optimistic about securing extensions before next summer, following positive initial discussions. Fichajes recently reported that Borussia Dortmund could be a surprising contender for the Dutch international. Dortmund are looking to add players who can strengthen their squad and boost their chances in both the Bundesliga and the Champions League. The same outlet also linked Liverpool with de Jong as a potential midfield addition. Given Barcelona’s financial struggles and de Jong’s reportedly high wages of around £300,000 per week, the club might consider selling him for the right offer. De Jong’s contract with Barcelona runs until 2026, but no extension has been signed yet. While an asking price wasn’t specified, Transfermarkt values him at €60 million.

In October, Eduardo Burgos of Diario AS revealed that both Bayern Munich and PSG made offers for Durán during the summer transfer window, but Aston Villa rejected them. Manager Unai Emery views the young forward as a future star. PSG and Bayern Munich are not alone in their interest, though. A recent report from Fichajes suggests that Arsenal and Barcelona are also monitoring the Colombian forward ahead of the 2025 transfer windows. Napoli are reportedly preparing a bid for Durán, according to the Italian newspaper Il Mattino (h/t The Mirror). The Serie A club are looking for a partner to support Romelu Lukaku and believes Durán is the right choice. They’ve already been in touch with the Colombian striker’s representatives, but Villa’s €40 million (£33 million) valuation could complicate the move. Durán is under contract until 2030 and has a transfer value of €35 million per Transfermarkt. Nonetheless, that amount should be increasing considering the player’s performance this season as he’s scored ten goals in 23 appearances across all competitions.

Paris Saint-Germain sold Ugarte to United for a reported €50 million, with an additional €10 million in potential add-ons and a 10 percent sell-on clause. While Erik ten Hag was the one who brought him to Old Trafford, the task of helping Ugarte reach his full potential now falls to new manager Rúben Amorim. The midfielder previously flourished under Amorim’s guidance at Sporting CP between 2021 and 2023, a period that paved the way for his move to PSG. The Uruguayan has silenced his critics, earning praise for being ‘horrible’ to play against after playing a key role in Manchester United’s weekend victory over rivals Manchester City. “He has really, really surprised me,” Troy Deeney said after naming Ugarte in his BBC Sport Team of the Week. “I know it’s still early days under the new manager, but Ugarte has a bit of bite about him. He’s a bit horrible and even at 1-0 down he was making important tackles, blocks and getting attacks started. “I thought he was the catalyst as to why they went on to win. I thought if it wasn’t for him they wouldn’t actually be in the game. An underrated performance that only his team-mates will appreciate.” Ugarte recently spoke about the Portuguese manager and noted what he’ll bring to the Manchester United squad, who have struggled to start this 2024-25 season. “I saw that the Sporting fans were upset and that’s obvious because Amorim is a great coach,” Ugarte said. “He’s good for United, we have to take advantage and let him get his ideas across as quickly as possible. I think it will be a different dynamic. “The day-to-day will be similar to that at Sporting. Changing the league, the country, football… It’s a big challenge for him but we all know he has the ability. My teammates ask me a lot about him. What surprised them was his age. He also really wants to win and that’s very important. I say he’ll like it.” Your email address will not be published.

They add that a loan deal with an option to buy seems the most likely outcome. Last month, Football Transfers reported that PSG are considering loaning out Kolo Muani during the January transfer window, with Newcastle and West Ham emerging as the main contenders. While no official asking price has been set, Transfermarkt currently values the forward at €30 million. As a Newcastle fan I just hope he signs for anyone but us. He’s average at best, had one decent (not great) season in Germany and has absolutely flopped at PSG in an easier league, he’s definitely not Premier League quality. Let’s hope Man Utd break the bank to sign him in January! Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked * Comment Name * Email * This site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

Moreover, their information claimed that Manchester United are open to selling the England forward and has set his price at £40 million. Nonetheless, there’s an update on the Spanish team’s interest in the attacking player. Rúben Amorim’s decision to leave Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho out of Manchester United’s squad for last Sunday’s derby has sparked rumors about the 27-year-old’s future at the club. Even without the duo, United pulled off a dramatic 2-1 win over Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium. Josko Gvardiol put City ahead with a first-half header, but Bruno Fernandes equalized with an 88th-minute penalty. Just two minutes later, Amad Diallo sealed the win, expertly rounding Éderson to score. Rashford’s omission from the squad for this match has only fueled growing speculation about his future at United. ESPN’s Mark Ogden reported in his column that Barcelona will not offer the forward a lifeline to jumpstart his career. “Only Real Madrid could potentially fund a move for Rashford right now and there is zero interest from the European champions, not only because of his poor form but because Carlo Ancelotti’s squad is already stacked with some of the world’s best attacking talent,” Ogden wrote. “Barcelona don’t have the money or the appetite to pursue Rashford, and while Atletico Madrid could consider a deal on loan or at a knockdown fee, it is difficult to imagine Rashford having the credentials required to play in a Diego Simeone team.” According to Laurie Whitwell of The Athletic, Paris Saint-Germain have no interest in Rashford. Additionally, Sky Sports’ Melissa Reddy notes that no clubs are currently pursuing Rashford, citing concerns over his form, off-pitch behavior, and high salary. Furthermore, Ogden notes that there are two options for Rashford at the moment and those are to get his career on track at Manchester United or head to Saudi Arabia.

After weeks on the sidelines, both Deniz Undav and Jamie Leweling were able to train with their teammates on Tuesday. The same goes for young winger Luca Raimund. A starting role for Undav and Leweling will probably come too soon, but they should have a good chance of making the squad. Stuttgart go into the game in sixth place after winning their last two Bundesliga games. Most recently, Sebastian Hoeness' men beat Heidenheim 3-1 thanks to goals from Maximilian Mittelstädt, Enzo Millot and Nick Woltemade."

Jamie embodies much of what people associate with the upward trend at VfB Stuttgart. It is his honest way of playing football and his will and ability to improve that has won him the hearts of many of our supporters, said Stuttgart managing director for sport Fabian Wohlgemuth. Jamie has become a difference-maker at VfB. He gives our game important impulses and initiates or is directly involved in many decisive moments. His call-up to the national team is a clear indication of the level of performance Jamie has reached here in recent months. “We are delighted with Jamie's clear commitment and the fact that, with this early extension, we have been able to bind an enormous amount of sporting quality to Stuttgart for the long term.” Jamie Leweling joined Stuttgart on loan for the 2023/24 season and was subsequently signed permanently for a reported fee of €5 million. After signing his new deal, he commented: “I know exactly what I have at VfB and am therefore very happy about the contract extension. The coach, the club officials and everyone at and around the club trust me and have been extremely supportive of my development. “I want to get back on the pitch soon and pick up where I left off before the injury,” added the winger, who has been sidelined with a hamstring injury since the beginning of November."

By extending his contract by a further year, the winger can look forward to a significant pay rise. Importantly for Stuttgart, the release clause of €20-25 million in Leweling's current contract won't be included in his new deal, according to Sky. Whether this means that Leweling will no longer have a release clause, or whether it will simply be set at a higher figure, is unclear. Leweling has made great strides since joining Stuttgart on a season-long loan from Union Berlin prior to last season - a move that has since been made permanent for €5 million. He played his first game for the German national team in October and scored on his debut."

He provided the assist for Maximilian Mittelstädt's opener, started the play that led to Enzo Millot's 2-1 goal, and rounded off the scoring from the penalty spot in the second half. At his post-match press conference, Stuttgart coach Sebastian Hoeness praised the striker, naming him his clear man of the match. He was clearly the man of the match and was involved in all three goals, Hoeness said, stressing that it wasn't just Woltemade's involvement in Stuttgart's goals that was important. “He was also involved in many other situations that helped us. He also took the pressure off us when he held balls or was fouled, which can sometimes be your last resort when you're coming up against a player of his stature. That's good for us, especially in a game like this.” Given his performance and form, Woltemade has put himself in a great position to start Stuttgart's final game of the year against St. Pauli on Saturday. “He is in very good form, and his stats are great. He decided the game for us today and is fully involved. That makes me very happy for him,” said Hoeness."

Lukas Kübler, Freiburg Scored a sensational brace to lead Freiburg to a 3-2 win over Wolfsburg. Danilho Doekhi, Union Berlin Rock solid at the back for Union, winning a total of 11 duels and completing 84 percent of his passes. Nico Elvedi, Gladbach Provided a wonderful assist for Robin Hack's goal and was solid at the back, winning five of seven aerial duels. Maximilian Mittelstädt, Stuttgart Opened the scoring for Stuttgart. Won five of eight ground duels and played with 89 percent passing accuracy. Angelo Stiller, Stuttgart Pulled the strings for Stuttgart and made four key passes. He also won eight of the ten duels for the ball on the ground he was involved in. Franck Honorat, Gladbach Provided excellent service to his teammates with seven crosses and two assists. Also completed four dribbles. Florian Wirtz, Bayer Leverkusen As influential as ever, Wirtz scored a wonderful goal and completed 91 percent of his passes. Alassane Plea, Gladbach Scored two well-taken goals to help Gladbach to a 4-1 win over Holstein Kiel. Lee Jae-sung, Mainz One of the architects behind Mainz's shock victory over Bayern, Lee scored both goals for the home side. Nick Woltemade, Stuttgart With El Bilal Touré and Deniz Undav out injured, Woltemade has stepped up his importance for Stuttgart. This time he provided an assist and scored from the penalty spot."

After the win, which lifted Stuttgart up to sixth in the table, the striker was delighted with his side's performance. It was a good game from us. We knew it would be tough, intense and a battle, but we deserved to win. We scored three goals again, got the win and had more chances to score, said Woltemade, who is happy to be playing up front alongside Ermedin Demirovic. It works very well with 'Demi' in attack. Together we create very good chances. But we're doing well in general - both those who are on the pitch from the start and the lads who come on. That's what distinguishes us, and the power from the bench is important. “Goals are always nice and I'm happy to have scored the penalty just before the end of the game. It's a great feeling.” Woltemade and Stuttgart play their final game of 2024 at home to St. Pauli on Saturday."

Five VfB goals - all of the highest quality - helped the Swabians bounce back from a 1-5 defeat in Belgrade and remain within striking distance of the UCL playoffs with two group stage match days remaining. Fabian Rieder collected a hat trick of assists in the win. German internationals Angelo Stiller, Josha Vagnoman, and Chris Führich scored their very first Champions' League goals. Yannik Keitel contributed an inspired performance off the bench. The 2023/24 Bundesliga runners up celebrated their first home UCL win in 15 years at the MHP Arena. Hoeneß lined his team up in the manner expected. Both teams donned black armbands in solidarity with Bern's Meschak Elia. The Congo DR international's son passed away yesterday. After a moment-of-silence to observe the loss, the Swiss guests got off to a surprisingly strong start against the heavily favored hosts. Five minutes had barely been played when the capital city side took a shock lead. After a nice one-two with Alan Virginius, Polish youth international Lukasz Lakomy fired an unstoppable laser past a helpless Alexander Nübel from about 20 meters out. There was an emotional scene after the 6th-minute 1-0 as Lakomy and his teammates held up Elia's tricot in front of the broadcast cameras. The YBB XI then immediately fell back in defense of their lead. Stuttgart could only manage narrow pinpricks through the predicable Demirovic channel in response. The VfB lead striker popped an effort over the bar on his best opportunity in the 22nd. Three minutes later, some more courageous play from Stiller enabled the hosts to net the equalizer. The German international charged forward, picked up Vagnoman in the box, and continued his run to finish off Vagnoman's return ball. Stiller's inaugural Champions' League goal helped the Swabians play with much more comfort and confidence over the course of the rest of the opening 45. A major chance at a second goal nevertheless didn't materialize before it was time to head into the tunnel. The hosts came out blazing after the restart, however, with Demirovic nearly netting the 2-1 just seconds after kickoff. A controversial scene in the 53rd enabled Stuttgart to take the lead. Fabian Rieder appeared to let the ball cross the byline after stripping Joel Monteiro in the box. The linesman's flag caused several Bernese players to stop even as Reider kept playing and serviced Millot on the 2-0. A VAR review confirmed that the ball did not go out into touch. Hence, the goal counted. Führich scored the 3-1 in the 61st with a brilliant distance effort every bit as equal to that of Lakomy's opener. Rieder collected his second assist of the night after setting Führich up off of what was a neat set-piece design put together by Hoeneß and staff. Führich then played a vital role in the 66th 4-1. A strong ball win from Führich began a sequence that ended with Vagnoman polishing off a Millot cross. Some nine minutes later, it was substitute Keitel's turn. The summer signing has barely featured at all for his new club due to the competitive situation in midfield. On for captain Atakan Karazor at the half, the 24-year-old contributed a very strong performance and was also involved in Vagnoman's goal. Keitel rolled home the 5-1 beautifully into the corner from outside the 18 central."

The heavily-capped German youth international leads die Gießböcke in scoring with eight league goals this season. Lemperle has also pocketed four league assists and scored once in the Pokal. The heavily-capped German youth international signed his current working papers in the summer of 2023 before being loaned out to SpVgg Greuther Fürth last season. He excelled for the Middle Franconian Kleeblätter during the 2023/24 campaign, scoring six league goals and adding six assists. His current estimated market worth stands at a career high €3 million. Germany's Kicker Magazine linked struggling TSG 1899 Hoffenheim with a January swoop for Lemperle last week. Various other sources have also thrown VfB Stuttgart into the mix; a rumor now confirmed by the cathedral city's reliable Geißblog fan-site. The Kölner site does take care to note that Lemperle might yet extend his deal in the Domstadt. Lemperle brings with him the experience of 26 total top flight appearances. He netted two Bundesliga goals whilst working with the Köln first team during the 2021/22 campaign, including what proved to be the winning tally in a 2-1 victory over Bochum on match-day three. The 22-year-old may opt to remain with the Effzeh as - just two points off top spot - promotion back to the top flight remains a possibility for his club."

German footballing journalist George Moissidis - the VfB correspondent for Kicker Magazine - links the Swabians with Nürnberg rising star Stefanos Tzimas. The 18-year-old Greek youth international is currently serving on loan at 1. FCN from parent club PAOK Thessaloniki. He's been immensely successful during his short stint in German football, scoring seven goals and registering one assist in 12 2. Bundesliga appearances. A new loan arrangement with PAOK could be arranged. Nürnberg could also purchase Tzimas outright and quickly flip him to the top tier side."

It's a very important game for us.” VfB have only collected four points from their five matches since the clubs return to the competition, and a 5-1 defeat at the hands of Red Star Belgrade did nothing to help die Schwaben in regards to potential further qualification. Regardless, this remains the aim for Hoeneß and his side. “We obviously want to play those two additional matches and stay in the competition,” remarked the 42-year-old, who continued on to discuss opponents Young Boys, who have been a dominant force in Switzerland in recent years, securing six of the last seven league titles across the border. “They are facing a few challenges in the league this season, but that doesn't change their general approach. They play direct and get the ball forward quickly, and they are very active without the ball, too.” Hoeneß also touched upon the energy levels of his side, with Stuttgart going through an inconsistent period throughout the first half of the 24/25 campaign, saying, We need to combine good positioning with the corresponding energy levels. On home soil at the MHPArena, VfB will be eager to pile the pressure on their opponents from Bern, with the visitors conceding 36 goals thus far in the Champions League this season. Hoeneß now has Ameen Al-Dakhil ready for selection once again, with the defender being part of the matchday squad for tonight's encounter. Jamie Leweling, El Bilal Toure, Deniz Undav and Dan-Axel Zagadou all remain sidelined through injury, something rather synonymous with Stuttgart's season thus far as the club grapples with an intensified schedule."

According to the report, Struth is expected to seek a substantial salary increase for his new client, with Stiller currently earning just €2 million a year at Stuttgart. Given the interest in Stiller from other clubs, the 23-year-old Germany international should be in a strong negotiating position. Barcelona are believed to be very keen on Stiller, who has also been linked with Premier League clubs. A return to Bayern, where he came through the youth ranks, is not on the cards, according to the report. Stuttgart would prefer to keep Stiller, but a bid in the region of €40 million could force them to consider selling the central midfielder. Stiller is tied to the club until 2027."

I personally haven't received a phone call, but I've also heard that there was interest, Guirassy told Sport Bild. “I've never had an offer from Bayern Munich, so the question doesn't even arise. I realized early on that I wanted to play for BVB,” he said of his decision to sign for Dortmund rather than Bayern. Asked about reported interest from Chelsea and Arsenal, Guirassy replied: “I like Germany, I like the Bundesliga. It's been the best stage for me in the last two years.

However, Dortmund are likely to face stiff competition for his signature, with Bayer Leverkusen and Paris Saint-Germain also thought to be interested. Given the interest in Millot and his low release clause, Stuttgart are aware that he is likely to leave the club this summer. It makes sense, therefore, to look at possible replacements and, according to Sky Germany, the Swabians see Paul Wanner as a candidate. Whether they will be able to sign the 18-year-old, who is currently on loan at Heidenheim, is doubtful, however, as Bayern Munich have made it clear that they see Wanner as a player for the future."

That defeat has left Sebastian Hoeness' men with just four points from five games, so a win would be very welcome as they host Young Boys at the MHPArena on Wednesday. The Swabians haven't lost since their defeat in Belgrade, and most recently staged a spirited comeback against Union Berlin to turn a 2-0 deficit into a 3-2 win, with substitute Nick Woltemade netting a brace. Unfortunately for Stuttgart, Woltemade isn't eligible for the Champions League, and neither is young striker Justin Diehl or defender Ramon Hendriks, adding to the pressure on an injury-hit squad. Strikers El Bilal Touré and Deniz Undav are definitely out, as are Dan-Axel Zagadou and Luca Raimund, but winger Jamie Leweling could be back in contention after a lengthy injury lay-off. Like Stuttgart, Young Boys suffered a painful defeat in their last Champions League game, which ended in a 6-1 loss to Atalanta. The Swiss side are bottom of the standings with zero points from five games, making Stuttgart strong favorites.

In an extensive interview published in the Monday print edition of Germany's preeminent footballing publication, Wehrle spoke on a variety of topics with the entire editorial board of Kicker Magazine. As a football functionary with a seat both on the DFL and DFP Supervisory Boards, Wehrle discussed everything from the new Bundesliga media rights deal to the DFB's voting plans on the 2034 World Cup in Saudi Arabia in addition to going into great depth about the state of his club. Wehrle's words on the recent experience of the VfB ultras proved most disconcerting. Smaller buses were pulled over and disproportionately checked, Wehrle said, Men and women were stripped naked due to the mere fact that they were football fans. Approximately 700 fans turned back at the border. The remaining fan scene [allowed in the stadium] were detained [in the guest block] for over two hours after the full-time whistle, Wehrle continued, They were not allowed to go to the restrooms or purchase concessions. This was unacceptable. These issues should be considered in the UEFA licensing procedure., Wehrle concluded, Every club that participates in the competition should ensure minimum standards. This includes a reasonable entry situation as well as humane cooperation at the stadium."

This time our team lines up in an attacking 3-5-2 formation. Peter Gulacsi, RB Leipzig Made five saves to help Leipzig keep a clean sheet against Holstein Kiel. Jonathan Tah, Bayer Leverkusen A strong performance from the Leverkusen centre-back, who scored his side's winner, won all his duels in the air and completed 91 percent of his passes. Willi Orban, RB Leipzig As solid as ever for Leipzig, he won six of his eight duels and played with 90 percent passing accuracy to help his team to a clean sheet. Mathias Ginter, Freiburg Scored Freiburg's only goal, won seven of 10 contests for the ball and completed 90 percent of his passes. Atakan Karazor, Stuttgart His first Bundesliga goal earned Stuttgart a 3-2 victory. He also provided an assist and won nine of his 13 duels. Joshua Kimmich, FC Bayern Pulled the strings for Bayern with an assist, five key passes and a 93 percent pass completion rate. Michael Olise, FC Bayern A constant threat for Bayern, Olise provided an assist, made four key passes and completed five of six dribble attempts. Jamal Musiala, FC Bayern Made the difference for Bayern, scoring a brace after coming on as a substitute. Paul Nebel, Mainz Another impressive performance from Nebel, who scored a brace. He didn't register an assist, but still managed a remarkable 0.89 xA. Jonas Wind, Wolfsburg Came off the bench at half-time to lead Wolfsburg to a 4-3 win over Mainz with a brace.

Wind handed Wolfsburg a dramatic late comeback victory over Mainz. The last time even two substitutes scored braces occurred on match-day two of the 2016/17 campaign. Finnish striker Joel Pohjanpalo, then representing Leverkusen, managed a hat-trick of the bench in a 3-1 win over Hamburger SV while Mark Uth (then a Hoffenheim player) notched two goals in a 4-4 draw with Mainz. The last time three players served as definitive Super Subs came on match-day 28 of the 1990/91 season when Stefan Kohn (Bochum), Lothar Sippel (Frankfurt), and Martin Driller (Dortmund) accomplished the feat. The previous records do count as slightly more special as they came before the five-substitute-allowance became a regular feature of German football."

Juventus have posed as a lacklustre outfit for their last three matches across all competitions. Two goalless draws against Milan and Aston Villa followed up with a 1-1 stalemate with Lecce have forced manager Thiago Motta to reconsider a few things. While the absence of Dusan Vlahovic played out its part in the goalscoring department, the Bianconeri have failed to execute a smooth line of gameplay during these matches. The Old Lady are still unbeaten this season in the Serie A but eight draws have sent them to secure sixth position in the league standings. A few wins could quickly shoot them up at the top of the pile. Meanwhile, Bologna have moved within touching range of Juventus, being just five points off their hosts for this weekend. Despite their Champions League loss to Lille last month, the Rossoblu have scored seven goals over their previous two outings. A 3-0 victory over Venezia with strikes from Dan Ndoye and Riccardo Orsolini set a formidable momentum for the side as they followed that up with a 4-0 win against Monza in the Coppa Italia midweek. Sam Beukema and Lukasz Skorupski are set to return from injuries. Here are the predicted line-ups for the match according to Sky Italia: Juventus (4-2-3-1): Di Gregorio; Danilo, Fatti, Kalulu, Cambiaso; Locatelli, Thuram; Conceicao, Koopmeiners, Weah; Vlahovic. Bologna (4-2-3-1): Skorupski; Posch, Beukema, Lucumì, Miranda; Freuler, Pobega; Ndoye, Odgaard, Karlsson; Castro. Trambak Bhattacherjee | GIFN @2024 - All Rights Reserved. Get Football Group"

Currently only a point behind seventh-placed Milan, Bologna have recovered well in the campaign after a slow start and Vincenzo Italiano’s side have shown that they are playing in the way that the new manager wants them to play. During the win over Venezia, Riccardo Orsolini was on the scoresheet and with that, he took his goalscoring tally to six and he also has two assists to his name. OptaPaolo last night took note of the Italian’s situation, stating that he is the first Serie A player to score over five goals in each season in the last seven seasons. In the top five European leagues, he is the fifth player to do it and he is behind Robert Lewandowski, Harry Kane, Kylian Mbappe and Mohamed Salah. That says a lot about the player, who scored ten times last season and 12 times in the 2022/23 season. He has been vital for Bologna’s presence in the Champions League and he played a key role in taking him there. Kaustubh Pandey I GIFN @2024 - All Rights Reserved. Get Football Group"

His compatriot Dallinga spoke to Corriere dello Sport about the defender’s future and his potential. He said:“There is great competition in his position in Holland.

Sunday's victory over Frankfurt in the Round 14 Bundesliga capper gave RB two league wins on-the-spin. Rose's Saxons - having also defeated Frankfurt in the cup - maintain hopes of capturing their third DFB Pokal in the last four years. Leipzig have the shortest training week of all top-flight clubs this week as they must go from contesting the Round 14 capper to playing league-leaders Bayern in Friday's Round 15 curtain-raiser. The German record champs slipped up against Mainz over the weekend, leaving plenty of teams the chance to catch up in the title race. With a win, Leipzig could pull within three points of Kompany's FCB. I can only pay tribute to those who played and gave it their all, Rose noted in his post-match comments last night, We've shown things that we've been missing in recent weeks. I believe that there is light at the end of the tunnel and things are now sustainable. Leipzig were buoyed by the return of midfielder Xaver Schlager to the starting XI. The 27-year-old Austrian international returned from injury to make his first start of the season. For his part, the midfield linchpin declared himself very happy to be back on the pitch with the boys. Fellow starter Christoph Baumgartner went a step further. I'm a different player when he's on the pitch, Baumgartner, who assisted on two goals in last night's win, He's an incredibly important player for us because he knows how to make the most of the spaces I'm in. Rose's crew can indeed look to the coming meeting with Bayern with optimism. In addition to Schlager, long-term injured defenders David Raum and El-Chadaille Bitshiabu logged minutes off the bench. Interestingly enough, back-up keeper Maarten Vandevoort also earned his first league start. Rose gave every indication that Vandevoort's start was an aberration. Skipper Peter Bulacsi should be back in goal against Bayern on Friday. On the question as to whether Schlager would again feature in the lineupp, Rose's attempts to keep it vague didn't exactly sound very convincing. The decision [to start Vandevoort] was made after the cup win, Rose said of his net-minding situation, Pete [Gulacsi] has opted out of national team duty and needs a break sometimes. He [Vandevoort] is our future. It was a good opportunity to give him some playing time. “Xaver sets the pace for us and influences our tempo, Rose said of Schalger, He makes a lot of good decisions, is a very strategic player and an aggressive leader. He played five more minutes [65] than we thought he was ready for. We have to see what the smart move for Friday is."

With just five points separating 4th and 10th, there is plenty to talk about after the fallout of matchday 14 in the Bundesliga. Bayern Munich suffered their first Bundesliga defeat of the season as a Jae-Sung Lee brace secured all three points for Mainz 05. Bayern started the brighter of the two with Micheal Olise having two decent chances in the opening 10 mins, his first effort inside five minutes rattling the post. Mainz got their noses in front as Bayern failed to clear their lines and a wicked deflection fell kindly for Lee who simply couldn’t miss. Mainz’s second, however, was anything but lucky as a beautifully crafted move on the right-hand-side found Lee in the box who cleverly turned his man and smashed the ball home. The move queued wild celebrations from the Mainz faithful including head coach Bo Henriksen who must have thought Christmas had come early. Bayern did pull one back a few minutes from time when the ball fell kindly for Leroy Sané who couldn’t miss but Mainz held on for an impressive victory. Mainz get back to winning ways following defeat to Wolfsburg and are right in the mix for European contention on 22 points in 7th. Bayern will look to bounce back in a huge game against RB Leipzig on matchday 15. Marco Rose had been under a lot of pressure at RB Leipzig in recent weeks but it appears his side have finally turned the corner and are back on track (domestically anyway). Following a winless November, the Saxons have reached the last eight of the DFB Pokal and secured back-to-back Bundesliga wins with their latest victory against Eintracht Frankfurt as Rose’s side ran out 2-1 winners. Leipzig took the lead through Benjamin Šeško who was quickest to react following a smart save from Kevin Trapp – Šeško only had eyes for the lopping ball with the Frankfurt defence perhaps a little disorientated as to where the ball had actually gone – Šeško was left to cushion the ball into the net. What followed was a flurry of chances from both sides including Frankfurt’s Omar Marmoush whose freekick rattled the crossbar and was just inches away from going in. Should that set piece have found the net, it would have been Marmoush’s third consecutive goal from a free kick. Frankfurt did get themselves level through Nathaniel Brown who is having a breakout season to remember. This was just his 7th Bundesliga game and that was his third goal having already assisted twice this campaign. He was teed up beautifully on the left as his shot cannoned against the far post and in. Leipzig got the winner five minutes into the second half when a corner was flicked onto the back post where Loïs Openda was left free to volley the ball into the net. It’s another impressive display from Marco Rose’s men who must love to welcome Frankfurt to the Red Bull Arena. The win puts Leipzig level on points with Frankfurt as they move up into 4th, breathing down the necks of Frankfurt in 3rd. Bayer Leverkusen are back up into second and four points off top spot following a 0-2 victory away at FC Augsburg. That’s now seven consecutive wins in all competitions for Xabi Alonso’s side who appear to have found their form again following a rocky opening to the season. Up next is 5th place SC Freiburg. TSG Hoffenheim scored an injury time equaliser to rescue a point away at Borussia Dortmund. The away side were more deserving of their point as they had the better opportunities and shots at goal. The draw leaves BVB in 8th on 22 points while Hoffenheim are in 14th on 14 points. VfL Bochum played the majority of their match away at Union Berlin with ten men. Despite this, they held on for a point and even took the lead in the 23rd minute. It was completely one-way traffic with constant pressure from Union but Bochum held on for what may not seem like an important point considering they haven’t a game yet but it’s a sign they haven’t given up. After this, you feel their first win is only a matter of time. GGFN | Jamie Allen @2023 - All Rights Reserved. Get Football Group"

The hosts started the first half hotly having a goal disallowed for offside within the first minute showing how lethal they are on the counter (remember this for later). Leipzig continued to have chance after chance and opened the scoring when Benjamin Seško headed in a parried shot. Kevin Trapp continued to hold off Frankfurt’s attempts at goal to keep die Adler in the game. While this was happening Frankfurt then began to grow into the game. Omar Marmoush provided a scare for the Leipzig defence when his free-kick hit the crossbar. Then Frankfurt equalised in the 40th minute when former Nürnberg teammates and friends off the pitch Can Uzun and Nathaniel Brown linked up to allow the left-back to lash in a shot off of the post to make it 1-1. In the second half, Leipzig continued to look lethal on the counter (again make a note of this) but it was from a set piece they would take the lead. A corner is played in a flick on by Christoph Baumgartner to the back post, where wide open is Loïs Openda, who volleys home to score his first goal in five Bundesliga games. Leipzig could have scored more in the second half if it were not for Trapp who made save after save to keep the hosts out. Most of Frankfurt’s chances in the second 45 were through Marmoush but the Egypitan could not put the team on his back. There was an interesting point however where Marmoush was tackled in the box by Baumgartner but did not go down for what would have likely been a penalty. The win for Leipzig is a statement one as it puts them back on track in the league after their Champions League elimination in midweek. This also sets up Leipzig’s next game nicely as they travel to Bayern Munich for their final game before the winter break. A win against the Rekordmeister will close the gap to them to three points and will paper over most of Leipzig’s recent problems. Leipzig will fancy their chances now against Bayern as they have shown how lethal they can be on…the counter (no prizes for guessing this as it was foreshadowed earlier) and this has consistently been one of Bayern’s weak points throughout this season. Leipzig will just have to hope their defence holds up (Bayern 4-0 Leipzig incoming). Frankfurt has hit the buffers recently and seems to be too dependent on Marmoush to help them to victory. Regardless, they are still in the top four and could end the year only three points off of the top if results go their way as well. Maarten Vandevoordt (6), Nicolas Seiwald (6), Willi Orban (5), Luthsharel Geertruida (6), Benjamin Henrichs (5), Xaver Schlager (5), Kevin Kampl (5), Antonio Nusa (6), Christoph Baumgarter (7), Benjamin Seško (6), Loïs Openda (7) Others: Lukas Klostermann (5), André Silva (5), El Chadaille Bitshiabu (-) Kevin Trapp (7), Rasmus Kristensen (5), Robin Koch (5), Arthur Theate (6), Nathaniel Brown (6), Ansgar Knauff (5), Mahmoud Dahoud (4), Hugo Larsson (5), Can Uzun (6), Hugo Ekitiké (5), Omar Marmoush (6) Others: Oscar Hojlund (5), Jean Bahoya (5), Igor Matanovic (5), Farès Chaïbi (-), Niels Nkounkou (-) Back to his best. Openda has struggled in recent games, but that has been in line with Leipzig’s form today looked back to the striker everyone knows he can be with his performance. Had plenty of shots at goal and probably could have scored more if it weren’t for Trapp (who deserves a shout-out). Openda’s other highlight was when he was substituted as he used, rather cleverly, a red bull can to help ease the pain in his ‘groin’ after blocking a shot.

RB Leipzig continued to put on the pressure for around another 15 minutes. However, against the run of play, Omar Marmoush hit the bar in the 32nd minute. Levelling the game, Frankfurt got an equaliser following the crossbar hit from Marmoush as Nathaniel Brown hit the ball low and hard into the net in the 40th minute to make it 1-1. In the second half, Loïs Openda finally got his goal in the 52nd minute as he scored from a corner after being left unmarked at the back post to put Leipzig 2-1 up. During the 55th minute, Frankfurt’s Omar Marmoush nearly crept in at the back post to capitalise on a defensive lapse from Leipzig. In the 68th minute, Eintracht's Ansgar Knauff drew a shot wide of the post. Antonio Nusa was on the end of a Leipzig counter attack helped on by Šeško but he was unable to score in the 78th minute. Lastly, in the 90th minute, a Benjamin Šeško goal was disallowed thanks to VAR as he was offside meaning the game stayed 2-1 for Leipzig.

Leipzig are in the midst of an injury crisis and will also want a reaction to their Champions League elimination in midweek. The only major change for Leipzig will be in midfield as Arthur Vermeeren misses out due to suspension after picking up five yellow cards, this opens the door for a return of Xaver Schlager to the starting 11. The Austrian has slowly been building his match fitness as he recovers from a ligament tear. Elsewhere, Xavi Simons, David Raum and Castello Lukeba continue to be absent. For Die Adler, after their midweek loss to Lyon, there will likely be rotation once again. Omar Marmoush will return to the starting 11 after starting on the bench on Thursday, while there could also be a first start for Oscar Højlund due to doubts surrounding Hugo Larsson as he deals with muscular problems.

However, they then experienced a drop-off in form, taking just one point from their next four games in the top flight, before they claimed a much-need win over Holstein Kiel last weekend. Benjamin Šeško and André Silva grabbed a goal apiece to guide Marco Rose’s side to a 2-0 away victory, leaving them in fourth position at the end of matchday 13. Unfortunately for Leipzig, they were unable to take anything from Tuesday’s Champions League home clash against Aston Villa despite coming from behind on two occasions. Ross Barkley’s deflected winner condemned die Roten Bullen to a 3-2 defeat at the Red Bull Arena, leaving them in 34th place without a point to their name after six games. As a result of that dismal record, Leipzig have been eliminated from the Champions League with two matches left to play. They will have to quickly pick themselves up for their second meeting with Frankfurt this month. The hosts will take confidence from the fact they recorded a commanding 3-0 home victory when the two sides faced off in the DFB-Pokal on December 4. In fact, Leipzig have won three of their previous four home games against Frankfurt in all competitions. The hosts are unable to call upon the injured Xavi Simons, Eljif Elmas, Assan Ouédraogo, Yussuf Poulsen, Castello Lukeba, Amadou Haidara and David Raum. Meanwhile, Arthur Vermeeren will serve a one-match suspension for an accumulation of yellow cards. Frankfurt had enjoyed a run of seven straight competitive victories before they were comfortably beaten at the Red Bull Arena earlier this month. That result proved to be the start of a three-game winless run, which includes a 2-2 draw in last Saturday’s Bundesliga home clash against Augsburg. Dino Toppmöller’s side then experienced an unsuccessful trip to France for Thursday’s Europa League meeting with Lyon. Ansgar Knauff opened the scoring at the Groupama Stadium, before Lyon netted three goals to take the game away from Frankfurt. Omar Marmoush reduced the deficit in the 85th minute, but it ultimately proved to little too late as die Adler fell to a narrow 3-2 defeat. After losing in Europe for the first time this season, Frankfurt will be looking to produce a response in Sunday’s Bundesliga fixture. The visitors can draw inspiration from the fact they have won four of their last six away league games, including victories in their previous two Bundesliga away outings against Stuttgart and Heidenheim. As a result, they now have the chance to clinch three consecutive away league victories for the first time since May/June 2020. The visitors are without Aurèle Amenda and Tuta due to ankle and calf injuries respectively."

Leipzig’s 3-2 loss to Aston Villa on Tuesday confirmed their elimination from the Champions League in the new league phase format. Despite this, Rose will lead Leipzig into the winter break and will start the second half of the season in the dugout at the Red Bull Arena. However, it cannot be ruled out that Rose will be sacked before the summer if things continue as they are. Former Bayer Leverkusen head coach Roger Schmidt is seen as a ‘shadow coach’ as he has previously been linked with the Leipzig job if Rose were to be sacked. Reinforcements arriving in the winter transfer window cannot be ruled out as Leipzig are currently in the midst of an injury crisis. While the biggest reinforcement of them all will arrive on January 1st when Jürgen Klopp begins his role at Red Bull Group.

However, according to Bild, the defeat hasn't changed Leipzig's stance that Rose will remain in charge beyond the turn of the year and start the second half of the season with the team. Should Rose lose his job later in the season, Roger Schmidt and Erik ten Hag have been named as candidates to take over.

However, the attacking midfielder does feel comfortable in Saxony. As reported by Bild, several hurdles are standing in the way of Leipzig when it comes to securing the future of Simons after his loan spell from Paris Saint Germain ends in the summer, the first being interest from clubs across the continent. Reports suggest that Liverpool, Manchester United, Inter and Barcelona have all enquired regarding the possibility of securing the 21-year-old's signature, with all names mentioned carrying the required financial weight. The next hurdle for RB is an €80m price tag that has previously been deemed unreachable for the German outfit. Potential options have been discussed, including a €50m payment with PSG, then receiving €30m of any future sale. On top of this, salary demands close to €15m would heavily stretch the current salary structure of the club.

The first is that Leipzig will have to go head to head with Liverpool, Manchester United, Inter Milan and Barcelona for Xavi’s signature. All have recently enquired about the 21 year old and have the financial power to sign him. A positive for Leipzig is that Simons feels comfortable in Saxony and under head coach Marco Rose. On top of this, talks between the Bundesliga side and Xavi’s parent club PSG are planned for the new year. However, the 21-year-old will not be making a decision on his future in January as the future of Rose will also play a part. The next hurdle for Leipzig is the price tag. It has previously been quoted that the Dutch international could cost close to €80m. A fee that is close to unreachable for Leipzig, so a potential payment option for the Bundesliga side would be a €50m payment with PSG then receiving €30m of any future sale. In addition, Xavi could demand close to €15m salary-wise which would heavily stretch Leipzig’s current salary structure. Since returning to the Red Bull Arena in the summer, Xavi has struggled to match his levels from last season but that has mainly been due to an ankle injury which has kept him out since October.

Die Roten Bullen needed a win to keep their qualification hopes alive, but instead they lost for the sixth time in a row in the Champions League. “That game was a perfect representation of our whole Champions League season, said Leipzig midfielder Christoph Baumgartner in a post-match interview. “We’ve been in every game, have been pushing for a goal and then end up losing in the end. It’s been like that in almost every match. It really hurts. We have to be honest and say that we’ve not been good enough to qualify.” He didn't want to excuse the defeat, but pointed out that a long list of injuries hasn't made things any easier. “We’ve got 14 or 15 players that are having to constantly play at the minute, it’s really tough.

Despite dragging themselves level twice on the night, Ross Barkley's late goal gave the English club victory and decided the Saxon club's fate. While there are still two fixtures yet to play, Die Roten Bullen can no longer advance to the knockout round with all teams ranked twenty-fifth or higher on 7 points or greater in the current standings. As has been the case in Europe all campaign, Leipzig made the worst start imaginable as Aston Villa constructed a lead inside 3 minutes. Some quick feet from Morgan Rogers allowed Matty Cash to cross to the back post. Ollie Watkins' deft flick into the path of John McGinn made for a simple tap-in. Marco Rose's men struggled but received a bit of kind fortune on 27 minutes from which they equalised. Emi Martinez hesitated beneath Seiwald's long ball, which gave Loïs Openda time to round the stranded shot-stopper and slot into an empty net. Unai Emery's decision to introduce Jhon Duran after the break proved to be a masterstroke. The Colombian worked a couple of nice passes with Rogers and Tielesmans before taking on Orbán and eyeing up the target. His strike from 30 yards dipped just beneath the crossbar with Gulacsi marginally off his line. Duran looked to bag his brace before the hour when he turned home a Matty Cash cross, however the Polish international was in an offside position. Amazingly, Leipzig responded in another rare foray upfield as Openda found Baumgartner in space to cushion a beautiful, in-step volley inside the left post. Gulacsi kept Lucas Digne at bay entering the last 20 minutes, while a lapse in concentration from Pau Torres gave the visitors a scare when Openda intercepted but released a rather tame shot. Yet lady luck would restore Villa's lead when Ross Barkley's strike deflected off Klostermann and wrong-footed Gulacsi."

The Biancocelesti took a chance on the 27-year-old last summer after being released by Fiorentina due to his lengthy injury ordeal. However, the Italian’s first few months at Formello also had their fair share of physical problems which derailed his momentum. Therefore, some reports suggest the two parties could put a premature end to their collaboration in January. According to Il Corriere dello Sport (via La Lazio Siamo Noi), Castovilli’s future will loom large on the club’s plans. At the moment, the Biancocelesti don’t have room for a new senior player in the Serie A squad, so if the Euro 2020 winner winds up staying in the Italian capital, any new arrivals would have to be under the age of 22. Hence, Lazio sporting director Angelo Fabiani drew a five-man shortlist that contains young and exciting profiles. As the Roman newspaper explains, Reda Belahyane remains on the club’s radar, despite Fabiani’s recent denials. The 20-year-old made his Serie A debut under Marco Baroni last season after signing for Hellas Verona in January, and has now become a regular feature. His valuation is circa €10 million, but the price could rise due to competition from Inter and Napoli. The source then mentions 19-year-old Stade Reims talent Valentin Atangana who would cost less than €10M, and 22-year-old Ismael Kone who is struggling for playing time at Olympique Marseille. The latter’s market value is around €12 million. Cesare Casadei also finds himself in a similar situation at Chelsea, and he’s been on Lazio’s radar for quite some time, but he’s also a target for Monza. Finally, the report confirms Lazio’s interest in Jacopo Fazzini, but Empoli are shooting high for the talented 21-year-old, seeking at least €20 million.

The Biancocelesti faithful flocked to the Stadio Olimpico in the hopes of witnessing another superb display from Marco Baroni’s men, especially following the excellent performances in the doubleheader against Napoli and then the Europa League contest against Ajax in Amsterdam. However, Monday night proved dramatically different. After conceding twice late in the first half, Lazio completely faltered following the break, shipping in another four. The home side was also hampered by the consequences, as Mario Gila fell ill and his replacement Samuel Gigot then suffered a blow to the head, which left Baroni with a makeshift backline. However, these incidents cannot justify a 0-6 defeat at home. But amid all the chaos, the Lazio supporters in the stands stuck by the team, expressing their never-ending love for the club with songs like “I Giardini di Marzo”, and then saluted the players after the final whistle. Therefore, Thuram was astonished by the Laziali’s reaction. “The Lazio fans are incredible. Did you see them?!” the French striker was caught whispering in the ear of former Lazio and Inter bomber Christian Vieri while being interviewed by DAZN after the contest (via Lazio Space).

The Aquile had a nightmarish evening on Monday, as the Nerazzurri ran riot at the Stadio Olimpico, coming away with an astonishing 6-0 victory. Lazio started their evening on a decent note and seemed to be the more dangerous side early on, but Tijjani Noslin couldn’t convert his chances. However, things began to turn sour when Mario Gila was forced to leave the pitch in the middle of the first half. Ironically, his replacement Samuel Gigot only lasted for a short while before he himself had to leave after receiving a blow to the head while defending the corner kick that resulted in a spot-kick for Inter. So in his post-match press conference (via La Lazio Siamo Noi), Baroni shed some light on the conditions of the defensive duo who both fell sick. Gila felt dizzy, he turned white. He was nauseous. Gigot, after the blow he received, was not well. He couldn’t make his way back to the pitch after halftime. The doctors tried, but he was in no condition to return to the field. Moreover, the Lazio coach revealed that he kept Boulaye Dia on the bench as his ankle has yet to fully heal, while revealing that his captain Mattia Zaccagni also picked up a slight knock. Dia has a small problem with his ankle, I didn’t think it was the right thing to introduce him. In these conditions, it seemed absurd to me. Even Mattia had a bruise. I took him off and gave [Gaetano] Castovilli the chance to play a few minutes. When games take such turns, you can only try to limit the damage. Your email address will not be published.

The Biancocelesti were looking to build on their recent exploits against Napoli and Ajax by beating the reigning Italian champions, but instead found themselves on the receiving end of the biggest poundings of the year. The Aquile astonishingly lost the contest by six unanswered goals. Therefore, Baroni took full responsibility for the result in his post-match interview with DAZN (via La Lazio Siamo). I’m sorry for the team and the fans, I take responsibility. We played a good forty minutes, but it wasn’t enough. The team fell apart. There are things that you can’t allow yousreslf to do against Inter. I didn’t control the team from an emotional standpoint, and so I take full responsibility. Lazio were certainly impeded by the circumstances, which include losing Mario Gila to injury and then his replacement Samuel Gigot which forced a makeshift backline, while they were unfortunate to concede a spot-kick from a handball. Nevertheless, the manager insists these incidents cannot justify the shockingly large result. I’ve already spoken to the players. This cannot happen to a team like us, I could talk about the unfortunate situations, but it’s useless. We lost our nerves. The team can’t fall apart like this. It must be an accident along the way against a great team to which you can’t allow any space. Nevertheless, the 61-year-old still defended his 4-2-3-1 formation, insisting it wasn’t the reason behind the catastrophic defeat. When we play with an offensive player between the lines, the team creates important situations, also thanks to the movement of the wingers. The nervous breakdown is also due to the packed schedule and tired legs, but you can’t lose like this. This is the first time it’s happened, but it can’t happen against a team that that punishes you when they steal possession. This is not a question of formations. We have widened and stretched out, which is something we usually don’t do and that’s why we are still able to play with four offensive players. The team was not just humiliated we were destroyed and badly exposed. It was like we folded after the 1st goal and never recovered. Norslin was a total waste and Pedro just couldn’t connect upfront. Playing against Inter that have perfected the 3-5-2 meant we couldn’t be wasteful with possession. But it’s a good lesson. We not there yet but surely we would..FORZIA LAZIO Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked * Comment Name * Email *"

Simone Inzaghi’s high-flying side inflicted Lazio’s first home league defeat this season to move within three points of table-topping Atalanta. Lazio and Inter were level on points ahead of the kick-off, and there was nothing to separate the teams until the 41st minute. However, Samuel Gigot’s reckless handball inside the box sent Hakan Calhanoglu to the spot. The Turkish midfielder made no mistake to break the deadlock. Only four minutes later, Inter doubled their lead through Federico Dimarco. The Italian wingback latched on to Denzel Dumfries’ cross on the back post to make it 2-0 at halftime. It took the Nerazzurri six minutes into the second half to put the game to bed as Nicolo Barella scored a stunning long-range half-volley. Lazio failed to recover from the shock, letting Inter assume complete control of the proceedings. After delivering an assist, Dumfries found the net with a towering header, extending the visitors’ advantage in the 53rd minute to four! However, Inzaghi’s team refused to rest on their laurels. Second-half substitute Carlos Augusto got to the scoresheet for the first time this season with a clinical left-footed finish from inside the box for Inter’s fifth. Marcus Thuram put the icing on the cake in the 90th minute with a fantastic solo effort, capping off a scintillating performance. Let’s look at our player ratings. Yann Sommer – 6 It was a quiet night for the Swiss goalkeeper, who didn’t have to make a single save since thwarting Gustav Isaksen’s early effort. Yann Bisseck – 6.5 Slotted in for Benjamin Pavard, the German defender fared well against Mattia Zaccagni but picked up a cheap yellow card toward the end of the first half. Stefan de Vrij – 7.5 The Dutchman rolled back the years against his former side, delivering a defensive masterclass to neutralize in-form Tijjani Noslin. Impeccable in possession! Alessandro Bastoni – 7 Had it not been for a harsh tackle that earned him a booking midway through the first half, it would’ve been a faultless showing from the star center-back. Denzel Dumfries – 8 Incredible performance! In addition to racking up a goal and an assist, the ex-PSV Eindhoven wingback was a permanent threat down the right flank all game. Nicolo Barella – 7.5 His sublime long-range screamer will make Serie A highlights until the end of the season. What a thunderbolt! Hakan Calhanoglu – 7.5 Back to the scoreboard with another well-taken penalty, the deep-lying playmaker did what he does best – dictating the pace with inch-perfect passing and unparalleled vision. Henrikh Mkhitaryan – 7 Despite failing to get his name on the board, the Armenian veteran was superb tonight, completing numerous progressive runs and linking up well with his teammates. Federico Dimarco – 7.5 A vintage Dimarco display! Brimming with confidence after scoring his third Serie A goal this season, the Inter stalwart picked up an assist and created havoc inside Lazio’s penalty area after the break. Lautaro Martinez – 6 The Argentine’s frustrating campaign goes on. Even though the Nerazzurri netted six, he wasn’t among the scorers. Marcus Thuram – 7.5 Unlike his attacking comrade, the Inter talisman grabbed a well-deserved late goal after driving Lazio’s defenders crazy all night.

The Biancocelesti are reportedly looking to bolster the midfield department with a new signing. They currently have five players vying for two spots in the current 4-2-3-1 system, but Marco Baroni has been teasing a switch to 4-3-3, which would require additional depth. Moreover, Gaetano Castrovilli’s future at Formello remains uncertain, with reports suggesting a potential early exit. According to Il Messaggero (via La Lazio Siamo Noi), the Aquile directors have set their sights on Fazzini who has been making a name for himself at Empoli over the past few years. The Tuscan club is renowned for producing talented young players who end up playing for bigger Serie A clubs, the likes of Tommaso Baldanzi, Samuele Ricci and Kristjan Asllani. Although the 21-year-old’s campaign has been hampered by injuries, he remains one of the most promising young central midfielders in Serie A. The Massa native has been developing his game with the Azzurri since making the move from his original club, Capezzano, in 2017. His contract with Empoli runs until June 2027. Moreover, the same source mentions that Lazio could strike a deal with Monza CEO Adriano Galliani that would see Jean-Daniel Akpa Akpro return to the U-Power Stadium. The 32-year-old has been omitted from Baroni’s plans this season. The report claims that the negotiations could also include young Monza midfielder Warren Bondo who has been on the Biancocelesti’s shortlist for quite some time now.

Marco Baroni will be hoping to have Matias Vecino and Alessio Romagnoli back in the squad, but neither man is expected to start. Ivan Provedel will return to the lineup, with Patric the favorite to start alongside Mario Gila. On the flanks, Nuno Tavares is certain of a starting berth, while Adam Marusic could win the ballot with Manuel Lazzari on the right flank. Nicolo Rovella and Matteo Guendouzi should resume their partnership in the middle of the park, with Fisayo Dele-Bashiru dropped after a series of impressive starts. Gustav Isaksen and Mattia Zaccagni should occupy the wings, while Pedro has recently emerged as the favorite for the attacking-midfielder role. Finally, Tijjani Noslin will fill in for the suspended Taty Castellanos. Lazio (4-2-3-1): Provedel; Marusic, Gila, Patric, Nuno Tavares; Guendouzi, Rovella; Isaksen, Pedro, Zaccagni; Noslin Simone Inzaghi will be without his two key defenders Francesco Acerbi and Benjamin Pavard, but he can still rely on a solid backline containing Stefan de Vrij and Alessandro Bastoni, while Yann Bisseck is the slight favorite to join them ahead of Matteo Darmian. Meanwhile, Denzel Dumfries and Federico Dimarco will occupy the wingback slots. The former Lazio boss should resort to his tried-and-trusted midfield trio of Nicolo Barello, Hakan Calhanoglu and Henrikh Mkhitaryan, while Lautaro Martinez joins forces with the in-form Marcus Thuram upfront.

The Spaniard has been enjoying an Indian Summer this season, producing seven goals and four assists in 17 appearances across all competitions. The 37-year-old is coming off a sensational display in the 3-1 victory over Ajax in Amsterdam where he provided Loum Tchaouna with a superb assist before scoring with a lovely curler. According to La Lazio Siamo Noi, Marco Baroni is looking to bank in on Pedro’s scintillating form by fielding him in a pivotal role. The former Barcelona and Chelsea man could start as an attacking midfielder behind Tijjani Noslin who will be filling in for the suspended Taty Castellanos. Boulaye Dia is the one who usually occupies this role, but the Senegalese hasn’t been at his best since his return from a slight ankle problem. He only lasted 45 minutes on Thursday before being replaced by Mattia Zaccagni. The latter will surely return to the starting lineup for the Nerazzurri clash, with Gustav Isaksen tipped to play on the right side. In previous days, Fisayo Dele-Bashiru was suggested as an option, coming in as a third midfielder alongside Nicolo Rovella and Matteo Guendouzi which could effectively change the formation from 4-2-3-1 to 4-3-3. Nevertheless, the in-form Nigerian might have to start on the bench, as Baroni appears more inclined to entrust Pedro with this delicate mission. Whatever Baroni chooses is for the best, not to mention everyone will play and they know it. It is a beautiful harmony right now in the dressing room so give your all lads and we will be proud and I think that would also mean victory but that’s irrelevant!

The 27-year-old rose to prominence during his time at Fiorentina and was even part of Italy’s Euro 2020 winning squad. However, a series of devastating knee injuries derailed his career, so the Tuscan club decided to release him last summer. Lazio pounced on the opportunity to sign the midfielder on a free transfer, betting on the player’s undoubted talent. However, Castrovilli has yet to showcase his prowess at the Stadio Olimpico. He also missed a month or so due to a meniscus problem that required a small surgical procedure. During his time out, Fisayo Dele-Basiru proved his worth, thus leaving Castrovilli at the bottom of Marco Baroni’s midfield pecking order. So according to Il Corriere dello Sport (via La Lazio Siamo Noi), the Biancocelesti could decide to part ways with the Italian in January, either by releasing him from his contract (which will expire in June) or allowing him to sign for a new club for free. This won’t constitute a capital loss for Lazio since they had also acquired him for free. Therefore, the Roman newspaper believes the next few contests will be decisive on this front. If Castrovilli fails to earn playing and prove he can contribute to the cause, his spell in the Italian capital could be cut short. In this case, Lazio would have some room on their Serie A squad in case they decide to sign a new midfielder in January. However, it should be noted that the former Fiorentina has been omitted from the Europa League list. Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked * Comment Name * Email *"

There’s nothing but goal difference to separate the teams ahead of the kick-off, with both trailing table-topping Atalanta by six points. Atalanta’s 1-0 triumph at Cagliari on Saturday has ramped up the pressure on Lazio and Inter to get into the win column. Marco Baroni’s men have frequently been there this season. A 3-1 win at Ajax in the UEFA Europa League last midweek solidified their momentum after beating Napoli in a mouth-watering doubleheader. Last weekend’s 1-0 victory at Stadio Diego Maradona reignited Lazio’s spirits following a disappointing 3-1 defeat at newcomers Parma. Gustav Isaksen’s late winner on a rainy night in Naples restored confidence around the Biancocelesti camp amid hot pursuit of only a third Serie A title in the club’s history. Inter will be out to hinder Lazio’s chances of returning to the throne for the first time since 1999/20, seeking redemption for a heart-wrenching defeat at Bayer Leverkusen last Tuesday. Nordi Mukiele’s 90th-minute goal denied the Nerazzurri a piece of UEFA Champions League history, knocking them down from a five-game unbeaten start (W4, D1). Simone Inzaghi’s men were minutes away from becoming the first Champions League team to go the first six matches of a new campaign without conceding. It was also Inter’s first scoring blank on the road in five games (W4, L1), heightening the pressure on Lautaro Martinez and his teammates to get a result in Rome. Lazio Despite four defeats across the opening 15 matchdays, Lazio head into proceedings as one of only three sides to have hit double digits in terms of league victories (W10, D1). Most of their good work has come on this ground, where Baroni’s charges boast a near-flawless top-flight record this season (W6, D1). As one of only four Serie A sides yet to lose a home match in 2024/25, Lazio stand out as one of the most formidable hosts in European football (W8, D2). Delivering action from the get-go, they have opened the scoring in seven of those eight wins, highlighting the potential for a quick-fire start. Given the strength of their opposition, nothing less would do on Monday. However, Lazio won’t shy away from the challenge. They may have slumped to a 2-0 defeat in this corresponding fixture last term, but they had enjoyed a prolific home run against Inter beforehand. Indeed, three victories from four previous duels at this venue (D1) perfectly encapsulate their ability to rise to the occasion in high-stakes encounters. Inter Inter had to swallow a bitter pill in Germany last week, relinquishing a remarkable 13-game unbeaten streak in all competitions (W11, D2). But it was nothing less than Leverkusen deserved, considering they had the Nerazzurri on the ropes all game. Whether it was fatigue or Inzaghi’s tactical choice, Inter didn’t look like a team capable of weathering the storm against a high-intensity opponent. However, equipped with confidence from their recent domestic triumphs, the visitors return to Serie A action, searching for a tenth consecutive unbeaten league outing (W7, D2). They’ve been particularly outstanding on the road. Along with Juventus, they’re the only Serie A side yet to lose an away league game this season (W4, D2). It’s also worth noting that they’ve won on their last four top-flight travels, including a 1-0 triumph at this stadium against Roma. That result initiated a run of three successive away league wins ‘to nil,’ bookended by an outrageous 5-0 rout of Hellas Verona in which they scored all goals before the break. In addition to long-term absentee Alessio Romagnoli, Lazio will be without their leading goalscorer, Taty Castellanos, for accumulated yellow cards. On the bright side, Luca Pellegrini and Patric have passed fit for this meeting after minor fitness problems forced them to withdraw in Amsterdam. As for Inter, Francesco Acerbi and Benjamin Pavard remain on the sidelines. It means ex-Lazio star Stefan de Vrij and 24-year-old Yann Bisseck will join forces with Alessandro Bastoni at the back. After commencing on the bench against Leverkusen, Nicolo Barella and Henrikh Mkhitaryan will likely regain their places in the midfield. Lazio (4-2-3-1): Provedel; Lazzari, Gila, Romagnoli, Tavares; Guendouzi, Rovella; Isaksen, Dia, Zaccagni; Noslin. Inter (3-5-2): Sommer; Bisseck, De Vrij, Bastoni; Dumfries, Barella, Calhanoglu, Mkhitaryan, Dimarco; Martinez, Thuram. Although Lazio are perfectly capable of causing an upset, it takes a brave man to bet against Inter. Both sides enter this round in fine form, but the visitors’ strength in depth gives them a cutting edge. Yet, even without Castellanos, the hosts have the tools to topple their former manager. Therefore, our recommendation is to kick back and enjoy the contest. It promises to be a memorable affair. Your email address will not be published.

The Nigerian midfielder had a relatively slow start to life at Formello after making the summer switch from Hatayspor. Nevertheless, he has risen to the plate as of late when the team required his services. He started the last three contests against Napoli in Coppa Italia and then three days later in Serie A, and the most recent one against Ajax in Amsterdam. The young player produced formidable displays on all three occasions which all ended in victories for the Biancocelesti. So according to La Lazio Siamo Noi, Nicolo Rovella and Matteo Guendouzi will resume their partnership in the middle of the park when Lazio host Inter on Monday, but Baroni could also decide to confirm Dele-Bashiru in the lineup, effectively changing the tactical formation from 4-2-3-1 to 4-3-3. In this case, Boulaye Dia would be dropped. The Senegalese has recently made his return to action following a swift stop, but he hasn’t been at his best in his last couple of appearances. Baroni only gave him 45 minutes against Ajax before replacing him with Mattia Zaccagni. The club captain will certainly return to the lineup along with Gustav Isaksen on the wings, while Tijjani Noslin should lead the line with Taty Castellanos serving a ban.

The Biancocelesti have been enjoying a formidable start to the season under Marco Baroni. While his arrival was accompanied by major doubts with the fans being skeptical about his credentials given the lack of experience on the big stage, the tone has certainly changed by now. At the moment, many would argue that the Italian capital side hit the jackpot by appointing the 61-year-old tactician. And if you feel you can emulate Claudio Lotito’s shrewd approach and earn money at an online casino, you should definitely try your luck at olybet and check out the review and bonuses on display. But despite their sensational start to the season across all competitions (Serie A, Coppa Italia and the Europa League), Lazio remain hellbent on improving their squad in the upcoming transfer sessions. According to Il Corriere dello Sport (via La Lazio Siamo Noi), signing a new midfielder will be the first order of business. The Roman newspaper expects Lotito and his sporting director Fabio Baroni to go to work in January to bolster Baroni’s midfield department. The squad currently features five midfielders in Nicolo Rovella, Matteo Guendouzi, Matias Vecino, Fisayo Dele-Bashiru and Gaetano Castrovilli. While this might be sufficient in a 4-2-3-1 formation, the manager has been teasing a switch to 4-3-3 at times, so a sixth member would be needed, especially for a club that looks to compete on several fronts. However, the new signing must be under the age of 22, as the senior list is already saturated – that is unless the club ends up selling a player, which doesn’t seem likely at this point. The first name on Lazio’s shortlist remains Hellas Verona’s Reda Belahyane who made his Serie A debut under Baroni last season before rising to prominence this season, even though Fabiani has recently denied any interest in the young Morocco international. The alternative option is former Roma man Benjamin Tahirovic who is finding little joy at Ajax these days and is seemingly desperate to leave Amsterdam. So it would be interesting to see him returning to Rome through the gates of Lazio. As for the summer, the Aquile will reportedly go hunting for a new right-back, possibly as a replacement for Adam Marusic who is running on an expiring contract, as well as a new centre-back to inject some fresh blood in an aging department.

The Serie A clash between Lazio and Inter Milan kicks off at 20:45 local time on Monday 16th December at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome. To find out how to watch Lazio vs Inter in your respective country, check out this verified list of international TV listings. After two disappointing results against Ludogorets and Parma, many feared Lazio had lost their early-season momentum, envisioning a steep decline in form. On the contrary, Marco Baroni’s men responded by beating Napoli twice in the space of 72 hours, and followed it up with a sensational victory in Amsterdam over Ajax to consolidate themselves as the absolute best team in the Europa League this season. In Serie A, the Italian capital side managed to put some daylight between themselves and 6th-placed Juventus. While they remain in 5th place, they are on par on points with Inter (3rd) and Fiorentina (4th) – although these two have a postponed match in hand – and only two points behind league leaders Atalanta. Inter’s recent momentum has been interrupted by a Champions League defeat at the hands of Bayer Leverkusen, but they remain among the favorites to finish in the Top 8 spots. As for the domestic league, they won four and drew one in their last five outings. While the standings show them in third place, They could have been first had they prevailed in their contest against Fiorentina which was delayed due to Edoardo Bove’s horrific fall. So although it hasn’t been smooth sailing for Simone Inzaghi’s men like last season, they’re beginning to show why they were deemed THE team to beat before a ball was kicked this term.

The 32-year-old started his career at his hometown club of Toulouse before being released in 2017. In February 2018, he was poached by Salernitana who were at the time under the ownership of Lazio president Claudio Lotito. After two years in Salerno, he signed for the Biancocelesti in the summer of 2020 and has been on the club’s books ever since. The Ivory Coast international spent two years at Formello under the guidance of Simone Inzaghi and Maurizio Sarri, but never truly carved himself a regular starting berth. Therefore, he spent the previous two campaigns on loan at Empoli and Monza. This summer, the midfielder failed to secure a move away from the Italian capital, so he’s been left on the sidelines, as Marco Baroni couldn’t find him a place on the Serie A and Europa League lists. Therefore, Akpa Akpro is expected to leave in January, and Il Corriere dello Sport (via La Lazio Siamo Noi) claims that Monza would like to bring him back to the U-Power Stadium. Alessandro Nesta’s team is currently struggling to lift themselves above the drop zone, so they could use the services of a savvy veteran. On the other hand, Tuttosalernitana.com (via La Lazio Siamo Noi) is linking the Ivorian with a return to Salernitana who currently lie in the bottom half of the Serie B table, and are facing the threat of relegation to Serie C.

While the Biancocelesti are wisely looking to invest their cash in a new modern stadium, perhaps you can consider a prosperous investment yourself and play for real money at sweet-bonanza-slot.net Australia where you’ll get to try your luck at the best sweet bonanza slot websites you can find online. As for Lazio, they have been working on possessing their own stadium rather than sharing the Stadio Olimpico with arch-rivals Roma, which has been the case over the past few decades. The Biancocelesti have identified the currently defunct Stadio Flaminio as the ideal solution. Club president Claudio Lotito thus attended a significant meeting at the municipality of Rome to present this project. The Lazio patron revealed after the summit with Mayor Roberto Gualtieri and Councilor Alessandro Onorato that the project was well-received, while revealing that acquiring the necessary paperwork could require another three years (via Calcio e Finanza). They appreciated the work we have done which highlights Lazio’s desire to redevelop the Flaminio stadium, safeguarding its architectural value but above all the area in which the facility is located. We are not only bulding Lazio’s ground, but the stadium of the city of Rome and which will be used by Lazio. We will also redevelop it in terms of traffic, acoustics, greenery and initiatives for the people who live the area. The total cost is circa €400 million. We will do everything to speed up the process, but it will probably take no less than three years to complete . There is a bureaucratic process to follow. For his part, Mayor Gualtieri expressed his delight with the project, noting that Lazio have well and truly done their homework. It went well. President Lotito and his team showed us the pre-feasibility study for the renovation of the Flaminio stadium project. A beautiful project , it will have to be examined in detail but we are happy that it has been announced that the proposal will be formally launched, thus triggering the administrative procedure. Now we will work to examine it in detail. It seems that Lazio has moved from intentions to will, to concrete facts . From here to a few hours we expect that what they presented to us also with video, will become an official request with all the necessary documentation. The Stadio Flaminio would be perfect for Lazio. The size is ideal and easily accessed in the center of Roma. Also its proximity across the Tiber from the Olimpico would make the rivalry even greater with AS Roma !!! Your email address will not be published.

The 21-year-old rose to prominence last season at Salernitana. He was one of the few bright lights in an otherwise disastrous campaign in Salerno which culminated in a relegation to Serie B. Nevertheless, the Frenchman was always going to get another crack at top-flight football, so he ended up sealing a move to Lazio for €10 million. While he hasn’t yet carved himself a starting spot in Marco Baroni’s lineup, the youngster is getting significant playing time, especially in the Europa League. On Thursday, he showcased his massive talent by scoring a goal and providing Pedro with an astonishing back-heel assist in the 3-1 victory over Ajax, which has apparently earned him some admirers. According to Spanish website Fichajes.net, PSG are willing to splash €30 million for Tchaouna. This would be a massive windfall for Lazio who would earn triple for their investment shortly following his arrival. This would be a return to France for the Chad native who began his career at Stade Rennais. However, the source notes it could be a risky move on the French champions’ part. Although the winger has displayed flashes of brilliance, he has yet to truly flourish in the Italian capital. This season, he has thus far scored two goals and provided an assist in 17 appearances across all competitions. Your email address will not be published.

That’s according to Mundo Deportivo, who have provided an insight into the latest developments behind the scenes in the Basque Country. Athletic, fresh off an impressive 2-0 downing of Fenerbahçe in midweek, today returned to work at the club’s training base, following a day of rest. This comes with a view to an upcoming La Liga meeting with Deportivo Alavés, on Sunday evening. Amid ongoing preparations for the trip to Mendizorroza, however, Ernesto Valverde and his staff were unable to call on five important members of Los Leones’ squad. As per MD, the quintet in question come in the form of Iñaki and Nico Williams, Yeray Álvarez, Oihan Sancet, and Ander Herrera. When it comes to their respective statuses for Sunday, the hope is that Iñaki and Sancet will be medically cleared, after being put through individualised training sessions on Friday. Midfielder Herrera, on the other hand, has been all but ruled out, with Nico and Yeray considered serious doubts, too. Conor Laird – GSFN @2023 - All Rights Reserved. Get Football Group"

From the goalkeeper to the striker, everyone needs to play their part. Athletic Club is a team that exemplifies this, but one man in midfield stands out above his peers across the entire league: Oihan Sancet. The man in the middle of the park for the Basque side has put in some incredible performances so far this season, racking up eight goals across 16 appearances this campaign. The 25-year-old leads the way for his midfield peers in La Liga across eight key metrics, as per DataMB; These performances have gone under the radar somewhat, especially amongst those who only watch La Liga for Real Madrid and Barcelona, but Athletic’s good results so far this season has them currently sitting in a Champions League place. The last part of the year could provide a good indicator of where the club may end up this season, as a match against Villarreal who are hot on their tale could predict how their push for Europe might go. While stars like Nico Williams will often take the headlines, it is important to give credit to players behind the scenes like Oihan Sancet, without whom the team wouldn’t be as cohesive a unit. 🇪🇸 Oihan Sancet vs La Liga Midfielders🥇 Goals — 1st🥇 Dribbles — 1st🥇 Shots — 1st🥇 Non-penalty goals — 1st🥇 Expected goals — 1st🥇 Offensive duels — 1st🥇 Attacking actions — 1st🥇 Progressive runs — 1st👨‍💼 Top 7 League profile: https://t.co/Cp0D4PUVWD pic.twitter.com/aoasXs4l2K GSFN | Ciaran Currie @2023 - All Rights Reserved.

Kylian Mbappé missed a penalty for the second time in three games following his spot-kick failure against Liverpool in the Champions League last week. In his post-match press conference after the loss in Bilbao, coach Carlo Ancelotti admitted Mbappé, who also missed a big opportunity earlier in the second half, wasn’t at his best but offered his backing to the Frenchman and Fede Valverde, who was at fault for Athletic’s winning goal. 🏁 @Athletic_en 2-1 @RealMadridEN⚽ 53' Berenguer⚽ 78' @BellinghamJude⚽ 80' Guruzeta#AthleticRealMadrid | @Emirates pic.twitter.com/8QZBln49Iw How is Mbappé doing?: “I haven’t spoken to him. It was a tough, evenly matched game, fought hard by both sides. When we equalized, we thought we could take control, but small details cost us tonight. We missed the penalty… I don’t judge a player’s performance based on a penalty, which sometimes goes in and sometimes doesn’t. Obviously, he’s sad and disappointed, but we have to move on.” Mbappé has played 20 games, scored 10 goals, and missed two penalties. He doesn’t seem like even 1% of the Mbappé we saw at PSG…: “He’s much more than 1%. He’s not at his best, but we need to give him time to adapt. He’s scored 10 goals and is working hard to improve.” And Fede Valverde?: “The fans are extraordinary. Fede, like Kylian, is sad and disappointed. He made a mistake, but we shouldn’t dwell on it. Fede is a great player. Mistakes happen in soccer, just like in life. We need to focus on the next game.” Do you think the loss was fair? Can you change the penalty taker?: “The game was evenly matched. Athletic is a very dangerous team; we competed and fought hard. I think a draw would have been fair based on the performance of both teams, but I have nothing to say about them winning. I think we defended well in the first half, but we could have done better with the ball. In the second half, we were better in attack and had opportunities. We’re still in the fight. We could have gotten a better result, but we’re here and thinking about Saturday’s game in Girona. Vinicius has taken many penalties and done well. Our penalty takers are Mbappé, Bellingham, and Vinicius.” Carlo Ancelotti and Kylian Mbappé spoke about his missed penalty following Real Madrid's 2-1 loss to Athletic Club.Mbappé said he takes full responsibility for it. pic.twitter.com/lmIuTXaRwo Did the reaction come too late?: “I don’t think so. Athletic took the lead, and then we played with a different intensity. It wasn’t too late because we equalized in the 78th minute and thought we could control the game.” Does it bother you when people question whether Mbappé should take penalties?: “It doesn’t bother me; it’s part of soccer. I think both [Bellingham and Mbappé] talked, and he took the responsibility but didn’t take it well. This can happen in soccer.” What do you think about the disallowed goal and the referee ignoring VAR?: “I didn’t see the play. It seemed like they were looking at offside and then the penalty. He called to review the situation and decided not to give the penalty.” What’s stranger: the three league losses this season or losing only one game last year?: “It’s stranger to have five losses [in all competitions] in a short time. We agree that we need to improve. We’ve improved some aspects in recent games, but we’re still not as solid as we were last year. The last two losses came in very tough stadiums. Now, little by little, we’ll recover players and improve our level.” REAL MADRID FIFA Club World Cup Original article written by Javier R.

Carlo Ancelotti’s team would have remained a point behind Barça with a game in hand had they won at San Mamés but their loss means the Catalans remain in the driving seat…although only just. Álex Berenguer put Athletic ahead early in the second half before Mbappé squandered two big opportunities to equalise. First, he shot straight at Julen Agirrezabala when all along inside the penalty area 10 minutes before his tame spot-kick was parried by the goalkeeper. Jude Bellingham and Antonio Rudiger went over to console Mbappé after the penalty incident 🇫🇷🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿Bravo Jude & Rudi 👏 pic.twitter.com/fRdhN1iKDd Exactly a week earlier, the French attacker had seen an almost identical penalty saved by Liverpool’s Caoimhin Kelleher, also when Madrid were 1-0 down in the second half of their 2-0 Champions League defeat to Arne Slot’s team. Like at Anfield, the miss proved extremely costly as Athletic went on to win the contest despite Jude Bellingham briefly levelling. After the game, Mbappé took to Instagram to confess that his penalty miss played a huge part in deciding Real Madrid’s fate. The 25-year-old did, however, vow to bounce back, with “what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger” very much his message. “Bad result. A big mistake in a match where every detail counts. I take full responsibility for it. A difficult moment but it’s the best time to change this situation and show who I am,” the attacker posted in English. The former Paris Saint-Germain star has scored 10 goals (and provided two assists) in 19 games since joining Real Madrid, a fine return for most strikers but arguably not for a player considered to be one of the best in the world in the last few years. REAL MADRID FIFA Club World Cup Mbappé and Madrid will quickly have an opportunity to put things right as they are back in action on Saturday (December 7), travelling to Girona in LaLiga (kickoff at 3pm ET).

Tchouaméni comes into Madrid’s line-up in Bilbao today, just under a month since the Frenchman suffered an ankle injury in the team’s Champions League defeat to AC Milan. Speaking to reporters yesterday, Ancelotti said: “He [Tchouaméni] is looking really good - he’s trained well and recovered well. He’s fit to play from the off.” 📋✅ Our starting XI! 🆚 @Athletic_en#AthleticRealMadrid pic.twitter.com/vBdel2MGGt Following Éder Militao’s serious knee injury last month, Tchouaméni had been expected to fill in for the Brazilian at center-back once he returned; however, 21-year-old Raúl Asencio has impressed in central defense in Tchouaméni’s absence. The Spaniard will start alongside Antonio Rüdiger in the Basque Country. On the left-hand side of the Madrid defense, full-back Fran García will keep his place, having earned praise from Ancelotti for his performance in Los Merengues’ weekend LaLiga win over Getafe. García will start ahead of Ferland Mendy, who gave an unconvincing display in the Champions League defeat to Liverpool a week ago. In midfield, the return of Tchouaméni allows Ancelotti to deploy Fede Valverde on the right flank, with the task of helping right-back Lucas Vázquez to keep Athletic winger Nico Williams in check. In attack, Rodrygo Goes is the favorite to partner Kylian Mbappé, with Vinícius Júnior currently unavailable due to a hamstring injury.

In his press conference today ahead of Real Madrid’s trip to Bilbao to take on Athletic Club, Carlo Ancelotti has confirmed that Aurélien Tchouaméni will be back for the match. ‘Tchouaméni is ready to play from the first minute. We’ll see tomorrow where he plays,’ Ancelotti said, raising questions about the position the French star could adopt in tomorrow’s match. The match tomorrow will be Tchouaméni’s first in around a month, as he last played in Madrid’s Champions League loss against AC Milan at the start of November. He most recently has played in midfield for Los Blancos but has also been adapted to play in central defence on occasion this season when the need has arisen. Real Madrid’s fans will be happy to see the 24-year-old make his return to action, as the club has sorely needed some rotation in recent weeks as it has seemed their players have been dropping like flies. ⚪️ @MrAncelotti, en rueda de prensa🇫🇷 Tchouaméni está listo para jugar desde el primer minuto.

Herrera, for his part, has played a bit-part role in the Basque Country over the early months of the new campaign, managing a total of 13 appearances, albeit only two of which came in the form of starts. Nevertheless, the former Manchester United man remains a trusted option on the part of boss Ernesto Valverde, as well as being an important voice in the dressing room. In turn, it will come as a blow for Los Leones to learn that Herrera is primed for a fresh spell out of action over the weeks ahead.

The youngster has also played seven games in the Europa league, grabbing one assist. Last year Stroeykens played 40 games for Anderlecht in all competitions, scoring six and providing six assists.

The former Fortuna Düsseldorf and Schalke 04 forward was struggling to find a new club after leaving Anderlecht in February and then Samsunspor in the summer. He ended up at KV Mechelen and has scored eight goals in 15 games. His late goal against Club Brugge was his fifth goal in just six games this season. If he keeps up this goalscoring form this season, the 30-year-old should surpass his 12 goals in 44 games for Anderlecht during the 2021/2022 season, the best of his career. Raman really broke out during his time with Fortuna. He was a key member of the side that won the 2 Bundesliga during the 2017/2018 season and grabbed 11 goals in their Bundesliga campaign the season after. He joined Schalke and struggled to replicate the form he had shown with Fortuna. After his move to Anderlecht, the striker fell out of favour. Most of Raman’s success this season has come from the bench. Besnik Hasi has used the lively forward as a substitute to great effect. Despite his goalscoring exploits in recent weeks, Hasi has been hesitant to start the forward. While Raman may prefer to start, it is hard to argue against what Hasi is doing. Raman has been great in short spells so far and gives Hasi a goal threat off the bench. GBeNeFN | Ben Jackson @2023 - All Rights Reserved. Get Football Group"

The 2-2 draw means that Anderlecht remain unbeaten in the competition with three wins and two draws. Porto, on the other hand, have only won one of their five matches in the competition, with this being their second draw. The away side took the lead from the spot with a generous penalty decision. Wanderson Galeno made no mistake from the spot to give the side a 1-0 lead going into half-time. However, the Brussels club came out of the dressing rooms quicker, with teenager Tristan Degreef making up for his involvement in the penalty to fire home an equaliser. Porto looked to have won it late on when Fabio Veira scored immediately after coming off the bench. However, just three minutes later in the 86th minute Amuzu struck. The winger’s shot from the edge of the box was deflected and looped over Diogo Costa into the back of the net. Anderlecht should be confident of qualification with Slavia Prague, Viktoria Plzen and Hoffenheim to come. Porto face FC Midtjylland, Olympiacos and Maccabi Tel Aviv in their final three fixtures.

The side are unbeaten in five matches and have yet to lose in the competition this season. Their opponents Porto, on the other hand, have lost three games on the bounce and are struggling in the Europa League. Despite injuries to some key players, Anderlecht are firing on all cylinders at the moment. Danish forward Kasper Dolberg has been in incredible form, with 14 goals in 21 games so far this season. Remarkably only one of these has come in the Europa League, but Porto should be wary of the forward on Thursday. The striker grabbed a brace at the weekend as the side won 6-0 at home to Gent, who ended the game with just nine men. Anderlecht have won three and drawn one of their Europa League matches this season. Porto, on the other hand, have only won one of their four European fixtures. The side are usually strong in Europe but are struggling this season. This has also been the case domestically in recent weeks. Porto have lost their previous three, including a 2-1 loss to Lazio, a 4-1 defeat to Benfica in the league and then a 2-1 cup defeat to Moreirense on Sunday. Wanderson Galeno has scored 11 goals in 18 games this season, while youngster Samuel Omorodion leads the side with an impressive 12 goals in 14 games. A win for Anderlecht should guarantee their place in the next round and potentially the top six, with Slavia Prague, Viktoria Plzen and Hoffenheim to come.

Charleroi are certainly one of those sides, as they slip further into trouble. Club Brugge will hope that Union can do them a favour against Genk to close the gap at the top. Sint Truiden v Mechelen A frustrated Sint Truiden welcome Mechelen to the Stayen on Friday evening. The side were wrongly denied an equaliser against Standard Liege last weekend as a good run of form came to an end. Mechelen rescued a point late on in their game last weekend against Union. Last season the Canaries won all four games that the sides played against each other in the regular season and the play offs. Kortrijk v Antwerp Antwerp have been in good form against sides that are not considered to be title challengers this season. Kortrijk are certainly a side they will fancy their chances against. Despite a win over Beerschot, the side were lackluster against Anderlecht last weekend a rarely troubled Colin Coosemans in goal. The side are yet to reach double figures for goals this season, whereas their opponents already have 25. Dender v OH Leuven Dender are struggling after a decent start to the season, with just one win in their last five. OH Leuven have also only won noe of their last five in the league. Both sides recent wins were against Charleroi, and both would have circled this one as a winnable game when the fixtures were announced. OH Leuven should have taken a point or three at home to Club Brugge last weekend, whereas Dender are also struggling to convert chances. This could be a low scoring affair. Charleroi v Westerlo Charleroi are in a terrible state. The side are spiralling into a relegation battle and now welcome Rik De Mil’s former side Westerlo on Saturday evening. Fans are already planning a 12 minute protest prior to the game, not entering the stadium until the 13th minute. The side have looked beyond poor in their last few games, whereas Westerlo have performed well even without getting many points, apart from lats weekend against Dender. They will fancy heaping more misery on the Zebras this weekend. Cercle Brugge v Anderlecht Anderlecht travel to Brugge with a growing injury list. Neither Ludwig Augustinsson nor Leander Dendoncker travelled to Latvia for the Europa League clash with RFS. Both sides drew their European matches during the week, with 10 man Cercle holding out against LASK in Austria. Anderlecht looked to have secured a late win over RFS, only for a Moussa N’Diaye own goal in stoppage time seeing them leave Latvia with just a point. Gent v Standard Liege Gent edged out Omonia Nicosia during the week thanks to goalkeeper Davy Roef. The goalkeeper might be busy against Standard, although their ability to take their chances has been lacking. Gent should, if they have any ambitions of challenging for the title, be able to beat a poor Standard side at home. However, the problems of inconsistency that have plagued the side in recent seasons appear to still be there in 2024. Union St Gilloise v Genk Genk are looking like the team to beat this season. They have won each of their last three games 2-0 and were comfortable in all of these. Union on the other hand are struggling. They played well against Roma in the Europa League, but could not grab all three points. Goals have been hard to come by for the Brussels based side, not something that Genk have struggled with. However, in the past, this is the sort of game that Union would rise to. Beerschot v Club Brugge Beerschot have a huge challenge on Sunday evening. Club Brugge were excellent in the week beating Aston Villa in the Champions League and will hope to coast through to victory over the basement side this weekend. Beerschot showed signs of life against Anderlecht a few weeks ago and have only lost one of their last five matches. Club, on the other hand, have won four on the bounce. Beerschot are already facing a gap of nine points to safety. GBeNeFN | Ben Jackson – Author of The Africa Cup of Nations: The History of an Underappreciated Tournament @2023 - All Rights Reserved.

Frankfurt are preparing for the Egyptian’s departure as he has already begun to attract interest from Europe’s biggest clubs and they are expected to receive around €60m for the 25-year-old. This means they need potential replacements lined up. Die Adler has a list of five to six players who could be brought in if Marmoush leaves. Rennes’ Arnaud Kalimuendo and Mainz’s Burkardt are among the options. The 24-year-old made his Germany senior international debut earlier this season and currently has 11 goals and two assists for the 05ers in this campaign, his first full fit after struggling with injuries the past couple of seasons. There are also internal solutions in Frankfurt. Hugo Ekitké is likely to stay at the club next season, Igor Matanovic has been used as an option off of the bench, while Jean Bahoya and Can Uzun could also be utilised with a change in formation.

One of the names on that list, alongside Stade Rennes' Arnaud Kalimuendo, is Mainz's Jonathan Burkardt, the German publication claims. Burkardt has been in fine form for Mainz this season, scoring 11 goals and providing two assists in 15 appearances.

If the pair continue their form then they could hope for call-ups next year. Brown himself has a chance to be called up as early as the next international break in March due to his great form for die Adler. The 21-year-old has only played seven times for Frankfurt in the Bundesliga this season, since joining from Nürnberg in the summer, but has scored three and assisted two and looks to have cemented his place as Frankfurt’s left-back going forward. Collins on the other hand has been a slow burner. After joining from Borussia Dortmund in 2023, he has taken a while to break into the Frankfurt first team, but has now become an option more recently, regularly being used at right-back. Hindsight is a wonderful thing, and the 20 year old is the type of player that Dortmund would need right now amid their injury issues in defence. With Brown and Collins both playing in positions where there is a significant lack of depth in the national team, their chances of getting a call up are probably even greater than first expected.

The 26 year old is not interested in extending his contract in the Fuggerstadt and will leave the club no later than in the summer, the club have already been informed of this decision. This means that Augsburg are open to selling Vargas in the winter for a fee of €1.5-2m. Gladbach and Frankfurt are both interested but they face competition from abroad as both Sevilla and Villarreal are also said to be monitoring the situation. Vargas has yet to score or assist in the league this season as an ankle injury kept him sidelined for parts of the hinründe, since his return he has been used off of the bench. For any Bundesliga side, the signing of the 26-year-old would be a smart move as on his day, he can be a very good player, but those days are too few and far between and he plays for Augsburg, which means it is also hard for him to consistently shine.

According to Sky Germany, Borussia Mönchengladbach and Eintracht Frankfurt are both interested in the Swiss international. With Vargas out of contract at the end of the season, Augsburg could look to cash in on him this winter. However, given the short amount of time left on his contract, Die Függerstädter probably can't expect to get more than €1.5-2 million for him. Gladbach and Eintracht are not the only suitors, though, as Villarreal and Sevilla are also said to be monitoring the attacking midfielder. Vargas has scored 23 goals and laid on 19 assists in 160 appearances for Augsburg."

And according to Sky Germany, Germany coach Julian Nagelsmann has been impressed with what he's seen from both youngsters. If they can keep up their impressive performances, both could be in line for their first call-ups to the national team next year. Brown could even make the squad as early as March when Germany play their next games, the report claims. Capable of playing at left back and left midfield, Brown has three goals and two assists in seven Bundesliga games for Eintracht this season. The 21-year-old joined Eintracht from FC Nürnberg in January. Collins, 20, was signed from Borussia Dortmund in the summer of 2023. He signed a new contract until 2023 on Monday. Both Collins and Brown have previously played for the German U21 national team."

The 20-year-old right back and newly capped Germany U21 international has made eleven appearances for Dino Toppmöller's Eintracht Frankfurt across all competitions this year, including seven starts. His previous deal ran through 2028. The new working papers - which surely include a pay raise - take him through 2030. “Nnamdi Collins is a very good example of how reliably we, as a club, are now able to offer young talent a clear development plan and put it into practice,” Eintracht sporting director Timmo Hardung noted in a statement released on the club's website, ”To achieve this, Nnamdi has worked hard on himself since he's been here and has shown the necessary patience and willingness. We pleased to continue on the path we have taken together for even longer.”"

Sunday's victory over Frankfurt in the Round 14 Bundesliga capper gave RB two league wins on-the-spin. Rose's Saxons - having also defeated Frankfurt in the cup - maintain hopes of capturing their third DFB Pokal in the last four years. Leipzig have the shortest training week of all top-flight clubs this week as they must go from contesting the Round 14 capper to playing league-leaders Bayern in Friday's Round 15 curtain-raiser. The German record champs slipped up against Mainz over the weekend, leaving plenty of teams the chance to catch up in the title race. With a win, Leipzig could pull within three points of Kompany's FCB. I can only pay tribute to those who played and gave it their all, Rose noted in his post-match comments last night, We've shown things that we've been missing in recent weeks. I believe that there is light at the end of the tunnel and things are now sustainable. Leipzig were buoyed by the return of midfielder Xaver Schlager to the starting XI. The 27-year-old Austrian international returned from injury to make his first start of the season. For his part, the midfield linchpin declared himself very happy to be back on the pitch with the boys. Fellow starter Christoph Baumgartner went a step further. I'm a different player when he's on the pitch, Baumgartner, who assisted on two goals in last night's win, He's an incredibly important player for us because he knows how to make the most of the spaces I'm in. Rose's crew can indeed look to the coming meeting with Bayern with optimism. In addition to Schlager, long-term injured defenders David Raum and El-Chadaille Bitshiabu logged minutes off the bench. Interestingly enough, back-up keeper Maarten Vandevoort also earned his first league start. Rose gave every indication that Vandevoort's start was an aberration. Skipper Peter Bulacsi should be back in goal against Bayern on Friday. On the question as to whether Schlager would again feature in the lineupp, Rose's attempts to keep it vague didn't exactly sound very convincing. The decision [to start Vandevoort] was made after the cup win, Rose said of his net-minding situation, Pete [Gulacsi] has opted out of national team duty and needs a break sometimes. He [Vandevoort] is our future. It was a good opportunity to give him some playing time. “Xaver sets the pace for us and influences our tempo, Rose said of Schalger, He makes a lot of good decisions, is a very strategic player and an aggressive leader. He played five more minutes [65] than we thought he was ready for. We have to see what the smart move for Friday is."

With just five points separating 4th and 10th, there is plenty to talk about after the fallout of matchday 14 in the Bundesliga. Bayern Munich suffered their first Bundesliga defeat of the season as a Jae-Sung Lee brace secured all three points for Mainz 05. Bayern started the brighter of the two with Micheal Olise having two decent chances in the opening 10 mins, his first effort inside five minutes rattling the post. Mainz got their noses in front as Bayern failed to clear their lines and a wicked deflection fell kindly for Lee who simply couldn’t miss. Mainz’s second, however, was anything but lucky as a beautifully crafted move on the right-hand-side found Lee in the box who cleverly turned his man and smashed the ball home. The move queued wild celebrations from the Mainz faithful including head coach Bo Henriksen who must have thought Christmas had come early. Bayern did pull one back a few minutes from time when the ball fell kindly for Leroy Sané who couldn’t miss but Mainz held on for an impressive victory. Mainz get back to winning ways following defeat to Wolfsburg and are right in the mix for European contention on 22 points in 7th. Bayern will look to bounce back in a huge game against RB Leipzig on matchday 15. Marco Rose had been under a lot of pressure at RB Leipzig in recent weeks but it appears his side have finally turned the corner and are back on track (domestically anyway). Following a winless November, the Saxons have reached the last eight of the DFB Pokal and secured back-to-back Bundesliga wins with their latest victory against Eintracht Frankfurt as Rose’s side ran out 2-1 winners. Leipzig took the lead through Benjamin Šeško who was quickest to react following a smart save from Kevin Trapp – Šeško only had eyes for the lopping ball with the Frankfurt defence perhaps a little disorientated as to where the ball had actually gone – Šeško was left to cushion the ball into the net. What followed was a flurry of chances from both sides including Frankfurt’s Omar Marmoush whose freekick rattled the crossbar and was just inches away from going in. Should that set piece have found the net, it would have been Marmoush’s third consecutive goal from a free kick. Frankfurt did get themselves level through Nathaniel Brown who is having a breakout season to remember. This was just his 7th Bundesliga game and that was his third goal having already assisted twice this campaign. He was teed up beautifully on the left as his shot cannoned against the far post and in. Leipzig got the winner five minutes into the second half when a corner was flicked onto the back post where Loïs Openda was left free to volley the ball into the net. It’s another impressive display from Marco Rose’s men who must love to welcome Frankfurt to the Red Bull Arena. The win puts Leipzig level on points with Frankfurt as they move up into 4th, breathing down the necks of Frankfurt in 3rd. Bayer Leverkusen are back up into second and four points off top spot following a 0-2 victory away at FC Augsburg. That’s now seven consecutive wins in all competitions for Xabi Alonso’s side who appear to have found their form again following a rocky opening to the season. Up next is 5th place SC Freiburg. TSG Hoffenheim scored an injury time equaliser to rescue a point away at Borussia Dortmund. The away side were more deserving of their point as they had the better opportunities and shots at goal. The draw leaves BVB in 8th on 22 points while Hoffenheim are in 14th on 14 points. VfL Bochum played the majority of their match away at Union Berlin with ten men. Despite this, they held on for a point and even took the lead in the 23rd minute. It was completely one-way traffic with constant pressure from Union but Bochum held on for what may not seem like an important point considering they haven’t a game yet but it’s a sign they haven’t given up. After this, you feel their first win is only a matter of time. GGFN | Jamie Allen @2023 - All Rights Reserved. Get Football Group"

The hosts started the first half hotly having a goal disallowed for offside within the first minute showing how lethal they are on the counter (remember this for later). Leipzig continued to have chance after chance and opened the scoring when Benjamin Seško headed in a parried shot. Kevin Trapp continued to hold off Frankfurt’s attempts at goal to keep die Adler in the game. While this was happening Frankfurt then began to grow into the game. Omar Marmoush provided a scare for the Leipzig defence when his free-kick hit the crossbar. Then Frankfurt equalised in the 40th minute when former Nürnberg teammates and friends off the pitch Can Uzun and Nathaniel Brown linked up to allow the left-back to lash in a shot off of the post to make it 1-1. In the second half, Leipzig continued to look lethal on the counter (again make a note of this) but it was from a set piece they would take the lead. A corner is played in a flick on by Christoph Baumgartner to the back post, where wide open is Loïs Openda, who volleys home to score his first goal in five Bundesliga games. Leipzig could have scored more in the second half if it were not for Trapp who made save after save to keep the hosts out. Most of Frankfurt’s chances in the second 45 were through Marmoush but the Egypitan could not put the team on his back. There was an interesting point however where Marmoush was tackled in the box by Baumgartner but did not go down for what would have likely been a penalty. The win for Leipzig is a statement one as it puts them back on track in the league after their Champions League elimination in midweek. This also sets up Leipzig’s next game nicely as they travel to Bayern Munich for their final game before the winter break. A win against the Rekordmeister will close the gap to them to three points and will paper over most of Leipzig’s recent problems. Leipzig will fancy their chances now against Bayern as they have shown how lethal they can be on…the counter (no prizes for guessing this as it was foreshadowed earlier) and this has consistently been one of Bayern’s weak points throughout this season. Leipzig will just have to hope their defence holds up (Bayern 4-0 Leipzig incoming). Frankfurt has hit the buffers recently and seems to be too dependent on Marmoush to help them to victory. Regardless, they are still in the top four and could end the year only three points off of the top if results go their way as well. Maarten Vandevoordt (6), Nicolas Seiwald (6), Willi Orban (5), Luthsharel Geertruida (6), Benjamin Henrichs (5), Xaver Schlager (5), Kevin Kampl (5), Antonio Nusa (6), Christoph Baumgarter (7), Benjamin Seško (6), Loïs Openda (7) Others: Lukas Klostermann (5), André Silva (5), El Chadaille Bitshiabu (-) Kevin Trapp (7), Rasmus Kristensen (5), Robin Koch (5), Arthur Theate (6), Nathaniel Brown (6), Ansgar Knauff (5), Mahmoud Dahoud (4), Hugo Larsson (5), Can Uzun (6), Hugo Ekitiké (5), Omar Marmoush (6) Others: Oscar Hojlund (5), Jean Bahoya (5), Igor Matanovic (5), Farès Chaïbi (-), Niels Nkounkou (-) Back to his best. Openda has struggled in recent games, but that has been in line with Leipzig’s form today looked back to the striker everyone knows he can be with his performance. Had plenty of shots at goal and probably could have scored more if it weren’t for Trapp (who deserves a shout-out). Openda’s other highlight was when he was substituted as he used, rather cleverly, a red bull can to help ease the pain in his ‘groin’ after blocking a shot.

After period of attacking threat, Leipzig scored through Benjamin Šeško in the 19th minute via a nodded effort from six yards out. RB Leipzig continued to put on the pressure for around another 15 minutes. However, against the run of play, Omar Marmoush hit the bar in the 32nd minute. Levelling the game, Frankfurt got an equaliser following the crossbar hit from Marmoush as Nathaniel Brown hit the ball low and hard into the net in the 40th minute to make it 1-1. In the second half, Loïs Openda finally got his goal in the 52nd minute as he scored from a corner after being left unmarked at the back post to put Leipzig 2-1 up. During the 55th minute, Frankfurt’s Omar Marmoush nearly crept in at the back post to capitalise on a defensive lapse from Leipzig. In the 68th minute, Eintracht's Ansgar Knauff drew a shot wide of the post. Antonio Nusa was on the end of a Leipzig counter attack helped on by Šeško but he was unable to score in the 78th minute. Lastly, in the 90th minute, a Benjamin Šeško goal was disallowed thanks to VAR as he was offside meaning the game stayed 2-1 for Leipzig. This result means Leipzig stay in fourth place but now draw level with Eintracht Frankfurt on 27 points after fourteen games."

However, they then experienced a drop-off in form, taking just one point from their next four games in the top flight, before they claimed a much-need win over Holstein Kiel last weekend. Benjamin Šeško and André Silva grabbed a goal apiece to guide Marco Rose’s side to a 2-0 away victory, leaving them in fourth position at the end of matchday 13. Unfortunately for Leipzig, they were unable to take anything from Tuesday’s Champions League home clash against Aston Villa despite coming from behind on two occasions. Ross Barkley’s deflected winner condemned die Roten Bullen to a 3-2 defeat at the Red Bull Arena, leaving them in 34th place without a point to their name after six games. As a result of that dismal record, Leipzig have been eliminated from the Champions League with two matches left to play. They will have to quickly pick themselves up for their second meeting with Frankfurt this month. The hosts will take confidence from the fact they recorded a commanding 3-0 home victory when the two sides faced off in the DFB-Pokal on December 4. In fact, Leipzig have won three of their previous four home games against Frankfurt in all competitions. The hosts are unable to call upon the injured Xavi Simons, Eljif Elmas, Assan Ouédraogo, Yussuf Poulsen, Castello Lukeba, Amadou Haidara and David Raum. Meanwhile, Arthur Vermeeren will serve a one-match suspension for an accumulation of yellow cards. Frankfurt had enjoyed a run of seven straight competitive victories before they were comfortably beaten at the Red Bull Arena earlier this month. That result proved to be the start of a three-game winless run, which includes a 2-2 draw in last Saturday’s Bundesliga home clash against Augsburg. Dino Toppmöller’s side then experienced an unsuccessful trip to France for Thursday’s Europa League meeting with Lyon. Ansgar Knauff opened the scoring at the Groupama Stadium, before Lyon netted three goals to take the game away from Frankfurt. Omar Marmoush reduced the deficit in the 85th minute, but it ultimately proved to little too late as die Adler fell to a narrow 3-2 defeat. After losing in Europe for the first time this season, Frankfurt will be looking to produce a response in Sunday’s Bundesliga fixture. The visitors can draw inspiration from the fact they have won four of their last six away league games, including victories in their previous two Bundesliga away outings against Stuttgart and Heidenheim. As a result, they now have the chance to clinch three consecutive away league victories for the first time since May/June 2020. The visitors are without Aurèle Amenda and Tuta due to ankle and calf injuries respectively."

Germany's RheinMainAdler were overpowered by a superior Olympique Lyon side at the Groupama Stadium on Thursday evening. Toppmöller actually defied both versions of his projected lineup, positioning Tuta as a sweeper ahead of a back-three of Arthur Theate, Robin Koch, and Nnamdi Collins. Niels Nkounkou and Ansgar Knauff served as wingbacks alongside the midfield tandem of German internationals Mahmoud Dahoud and Mario Götze. Hugo Ekitiké and Fares Chaibi worked together in a two striker set. The German guests found themselves lucky not fall behind early when former Bayern man Corentin Tolisso struck the post in the 7th. Former Arsenal striker Alexandre Lacazette then produced the next chance in the 11th, shooting wide only to the fact that Collins flustered him with close marking. Frankfurt didn't necessarily begin the match terribly despite the disadvantage in chances. It was such that, when Ansgar Knauff scored the opener in the 19th, it didn't feel undeserved. An excellent through-ball from Götze and delicately placed cross set Knauff up. The finish off the volley was also worth seeing. Lyon nevertheless quickly struck back via a player heavily linked with a Bundesliga move this summer. Rayan Cerki skills tipped in a Tolisso distance effort to equalize in the 27th. Toppomöller's side had great difficulty coping with the fast-paced attacks of their hosts for the duration of the opening 45. Only the post saved SGE keeper Kevin Trapp - once again looking shaky - in the 36th. Somehow, the first-half ended without Lyon scoring another goal. Toppmöller attempted to shore up his weak left flank by introducing Rasmus Kristensen for Nkounkou at the half. The Germans appeared more alert for about all of five minutes. Cherki tore through the SGE ranks on a counter in the 50th, ultimately setting up Malick Fofana's 2-1. Three minutes later, Cherki then registered an assist on the 3-1. In complete confirmation that Toppmöller's personnel management wasn't working, Ernest Nuamah totally toasted substitute Kristensen on the third goal. Toppmöller reacted by introducing Marmoush and Can Uzun in the 64th. The two substitutes would eventually combine to pull a goal back five minutes from time. Marmoush's poached 85th-minute 2-3 would still come too little, too late. The seven-plus minutes of injury time featured several hard fouls and a series of bookings from Andris Treimanis. Matters culminated in Toppmöller himself losing control of his emotions and being thrown off the pitch on a straight red."

Nmandi Collins takes over for Rasmus Kristensen at right back.

Frankfurt's strong form in this year's UEL have them entering this match in third place in the table. A win here will surely prove sufficient to clinch a place in the Europa League knockouts in the coming calendar year. Lyon are nevertheless no slouches themselves in this competition, in seventh place after beating Olympiakos, Glasgow Rangers, and Qarabag Agdam. Pierre Sage's Lyon have only lost once in their last nine fixtures on-the-spin, merely dropping a UEL group stage match against Besiktas in late October. In their most recent meeting with a Bundesliga side, L'OL created plenty of headaches for Pellegrino Matarazzo's Hoffenheim in a 2-2 draw in early November. The round four Europa League fixture would prove to Matarazzo's penultimate match in charge. Several of Frankfurt's French star players prepare to return to their home turf. Hugo Ekitiké, Niels Nkounkou, Ellyes Skhiri, and Jean-Matteo Bahoya could all feature in the starting XI. Lyon-born Fares Chaibi - after struggling with form issues earlier this year - has been gaining more trust and playing time under Toppmöller as of late. Ekitiké - whilst representing Stade Reims in December of 2021 - scored a dramatic late winner against Lyon in the Parc Olympique Lyonnais. Toppmöller made certain to bring this factoid up at his Wednesday pre-match press conference, noting that it would make for a nice story if the 22-year-old could replicate the feat.

Despite the high goals, many of the games were close run affairs and with them came a lot of talking points. These are your talking points and recap from matchday 13 in the Bundesliga. Bayern Munich overcame FC Heidenheim 4-2 to extend their lead at the top of the table to six points. Though it seems like another standard Bayern victory, all is not how it sounds. Bayern rested Jamal Musiala from their midweek duel with Bayer Leverkusen in the cup and it clearly showed that there was a creative spark missing from the first half. After Dayot Upamecano gave Bayern the lead but then the Frenchman gifted the visitors their equaliser in the second half. Enter Jamal Musiala. The 21-year-old made an immediate impact giving Bayern the lead. Leon Goretzka would then make it 3-1, before former Bayern player Niklas Dorsch provided a brief scare. Musiala would then make it 4-2. This result showed that no matter how strong the opponent is, Bayern struggle without Musiala. This is obviously not sustainable as shown earlier on this season when Bayern struggled against Eintracht Frankfurt, Aston Villa and Barcelona. The Friday night game between VfB Stuttgart and Union Berlin turned out to be a cracker and would set the tone for the rest of the matchday. Union looked comfortable with two goals either side of half time to take a 0-2 lead after 50 minutes. However, a Nick Woltemade brace and a first Bundesliga goal from Atakan Karazor ensured a stunning comeback from the Swabians. Union looked stunned following the equaliser and never really got going again. Having only conceded 11 goals prior to the game, the collapse was all the more surprising. The winner for Stuttgart highlighted Union’s complete meltdown as goalkeeper Frederik Rønnow passed the ball to Karazor allowing him to finish with ease. It’s a welcome win for Stuttgart and shows they still have that fighting spirit which has served them so well over the past 18 months. The win leaves them in 8th and just one point from 5th. The Ralph Hasenhüttl renaissance is well and truly underway at VfL Wolfsburg. Their thrilling 4-3 victory over Mainz 05 sends them all the way into 5th and well within a shout for Europe next term. With both sides on a five game unbeaten run going into this one, there was no wonder that forwards dominated the day. Mainz went ahead early with a great move to set Paul Nebel away who finished into the far corner. However, Wolfsburg found themselves level just six minutes later, Mohammed Amoura firing home after the keeper’s original stop. The goal was made by the brilliance of Tiago Tomás whose solo run near the touchline created the goal scoring chance in the first place. Jonathan Burkardt then restored the visitor’s lead five minutes before the break and in doing so became the club’s joint all-time goalscorer in the Bundesliga. Shortly after the break Amoura turned provided for Tomás whose deflected effort found its way into the net. Back came Mainz once again with Nebel, which was his first top flight brace of his career and his third goal of the campaign. Jonas Wind looked to at least salvage a point for Wolfsburg with seven minutes to go, but deep into stoppage time Wind went one better and headed home a freekick to ensure Wolfsburg took all three points. Wolves unbeaten in six games now and inflict Mainz’s first away defeat since March. RB Leipzig got back to winning ways with a comfortable 0-2 away victory at Holstein Kiel. Though the hosts had more of the ball and shots, they never really threatened Péter Gulácsi in the Saxon’s goal. The win keeps Leipzig in 4th. Borussia Dortmund have now failed to win an away game from their opening five away fixtures having draw 1-1 in Mönchengladbach. In fact, BVB have taken just one point from a possible 15 from away fixtures so far. The only positive was that Jamie Gittens found the net again and continues to impress. Eintracht Frankfurt were held to a 2-2 draw at home to a stubborn FC Augsburg side. A quiet day for Frankfurt’s forward despite the team dominating the ball for most of the game. Perhaps the draw is a little reminder that though Frankfurt are a fun watch, they’re the youngest team in the league and lacked experience when it comes to these types of games. Elsewhere, there were wins for Werder Bremen at still winless Bochum (0-1), Bayer Leverkusen beat St. Pauli (2-1) and SC Freiburg played out a 1-1 draw with TSG Hoffenheim.

9810,1C66D7CABC628114FD2FDB67A5F08FF7,3 things we learnt from the Bundesliga Konferenz,https://www.getfootballnewsgermany.com/assets/fc-bayern-munchen-v-1-fc-heidenheim-1846-bundesliga-10-1024x724.jpg,2024-12-07T17:00:30.000Z,Get German Football News,https://www.getfootballnewsgermany.com/2024/3-things-we-learnt-from-the-bundesliga-konferenz-3/,"After VfB Stuttgart opened matchday 13 of the Bundesliga with a comeback 3-2 win against Union Berlin, the afternoon kick-offs saw Bayern Munich hold off Heidenheim to win 4-2, Bayer Leverkusen beat St Pauli 2-1, RB Leipzig returned to winning ways as they beat Holstein Kiel 2-0, Werder Bremen beat Bochum 1-0 and Eintracht Frankfurt faulted in their chase down of Bayern as they drew 2-2 with Augsburg. So here is what we learnt: After Bayern’s 1-0 loss to Bayer Leverkusen in midweek, Musiala was given a well-deserved rest as Bayern should of comfortably pushed aside Heidenheim. However, this was not the case. After Dayot Upamecano gave Bayern the lead but then the Frenchman gifted the visitors their equaliser in the second half. Enter Jamal Musiala. The 21-year-old made an immediate impact giving Bayern the lead. Leon Goretzka would then make it 3-1, before former Bayern player Niklas Dorsch provided a brief scare. Musiala would then make it 4-2. This result showed that no matter how strong the opponent is, Bayern struggle without Musiala. This is obviously not sustainable as shown earlier on this season when Bayern struggled against Eintracht Frankfurt, Aston Villa and Barcelona. It is entirely feasible to say that without the impact of Musiala, Bayern would only have a small margin of a lead on the likes of Frankfurt and Leverkusen, or even in the pack of teams below them in the table. After their disastrous result last weekend, Leipzig bounced back in midweek with a convincing win against Frankfurt while this weekend they beat Holstien Kiel. Granted, it is Kiel, but a win is a win and it helps Leipzig move in the right direction as they look to end the year on a high and two tough games against Frankfurt and Bayern on the horizon to round of the year. The big positive for Leipzig is the fact that Benjamin Seško is finally finding his scoring boots once again. His goal in the North of Germany was not as impressive as his goal in midweek as Kiel keeper Timon Weiner saved his initial shot but he would score the rebound. The lesser spotted André Silva would then make it 2-0 for Leipzig from the penalty spot. Another positive is the slow introduction of Xaver Schlager. On his day, the midfielder is key to how Leipzig play when they are at their best and he has slowly been building his match fitness as he returns from a ACL injury. It is possible that he could make his first start back against Bayern. Frankfurt have been one of the early-season contenders in the Bundesliga this season and has at times looked unstoppable, today should have been one of those days as well, but they struggled to make use of their dominance. A quiet day for Omar Marmoush but strike partner Hugo Ekitiké gave die Adler the lead, however, Augsburg would score two in 11 minutes with the second being gifted by Kevin Trapp. Can Uzun scored a well-taken effort to equalise for Frankfurt. The draw means Frankfurt are now six points behind Bayern, but no one ever thought they could truly challenge for the title. This type of result shows Frankfurt’s lack of experience. They are the youngest team in the league, and teams that compete at the top usually find a way to win, whether they deserve it or not, and Frankfurt were unable to do this today. Die Adler will have to pick themselves up and go again next weekend as they face Leipzig. GGFN | Jack Meenan @2023 - All Rights Reserved. Get Football Group"

Which clubs could be in the market for the England international? Wednesday 18 December 2024 13:45, UK Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Marcus Rashford's future is up in the air after the Man Utd forward said he was ready for a new challenge - but which clubs would be in the market to sign him in January? The forward, who likes to cut in from the left wing, is now 27 and, after being left out of the United squad for the derby day win at Manchester City on Sunday, looks set to leave the Old Trafford club after almost 20 years. But the picture is complicated, with potential buying clubs having to weigh up Rashford's signing against his likely financial demands and also whether he fits into a position they require strengthening. There are also Ruben Amorim's comments to consider, with the United boss saying he believes the team is stronger with Rashford… Sky Sports' Senior Football Journalist Peter Smith: Arsenal perhaps is the club in England that you think: maybe that could be the connection. It's not going to be Liverpool, it's not going to be Man City given the rivalries with Man United. And Chelsea, they've got plenty of wingers at the moment. They also don't pay the wages that Rashford will come with. Transfer Centre LIVE! Papers - latest headlines Stream Sky Sports with NOW Get Sky Sports Download the Sky Sports App Get Sky Sports on WhatsApp! Arsenal signed Raheem Sterling on loan from Chelsea in the summer and they see that as a good financial deal for them, because Chelsea are still paying quite a big chunk of Sterling's wages while he's at Arsenal until the end of this season. So maybe they could do something similar with Rashford if it was just a loan deal to get him playing football and playing regularly in the Premier League. Arsenal need a bit of help on the left as well - Leandro Trossard and Gabriel Martinelli haven't delivered enough his year. But does Rashford do enough out of possession to fit into Mikel Arteta's system? Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Sky Sports' Senior Football Journalist Peter Smith: PSG have just gone through this big project of trying to move out all of these Galacticos, all these superstars: Lionel Messi, Kylian Mbappe, Neymar... They didn't want to be burdened with these super A-listers earning hundreds and hundreds of thousands of pounds a week. They wanted to bring through young, talented players like Bradley Barcola, who plays on the left side that Rashford wants to play in. So even when you're talking about PSG, which I think over the last few seasons has been mooted as a potential destination for Rashford - he scored a fantastic high-pressure penalty for Man United there in the Champions League so they've seen firsthand what he can do - but maybe that's gone away a little bit. Sky Sports' European Football Expert Dougie Critchley: I think in 2022, it felt a lot more likely. Barcola has been one of their best players so far this season. He's scored 10 goals in 13 league games. Desire Doue is only 19 and he can play on the left-hand side or as a number 10. They don't really need another left winger. And I think that's the story for so many clubs around Europe. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Sky Sports' European Football Expert Dougie Critchley: If you go to Spain, Real Madrid have got Vinicius Junior. They're not moving him on anytime soon. And also, with Rashford's performances, is he going to get a move to a club of the calibre of Real Madrid? Unlikely. But then you go around to Barcelona, they've got Dani Olmo, they've got Raphinha, who's been one of the best players in Europe so far this season. At Atletico Madrid, Diego Simeone still sticks to a 4-4-2, but they've got Samuel Lino, a really promising left winger on their books. You go to Germany, Kingsley Coman, Serge Gnabry, Leroy Sane at Bayern Munich - they don't need a left winger. Jamie Gittens is absolutely excelling at Borussia Dortmund. They don't need a left winger. Lois Openda and Benjamin Sesko at RB Leipzig are doing great work there. They don't need him. Even at a club like AC Milan, they've got Rafael Leao. You get the picture. There's not really that many destinations for him. And the club that probably felt like the most possible, maybe a year or two ago, was maybe Juventus but they've got this young kid coming through called Kenan Yildiz, who's been given the number 10 shirt - the shirt that Pogba wore, that Dybala wore, Del Piero wore. And he's playing really, really well on the left-hand side. So they don't really particularly need him either. The clubs that you'd expect Rashford to go to a few years ago, when he was having 30-goal seasons, when he was performing so well for England… this drop-off in form couldn't have come at a worse time for him when the rest of Europe don't have that much cash available to them and left-wingers around Europe are really stocked as well. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Sky Sports' Senior Football Journalist Peter Smith: What I thought was interesting was Amorim saying he's looking for ways to get Marcus Rashford to his best level. I don't think it's the first time we've heard a Man United manager say that. We know he's a big talent. That's what Amorim called him: a big talent. But can he do it consistently? That's always been the question with Rashford. Of course, you've got to say, during this period, Man United have made lots of changes of managers, lots of changes in terms of the personnel around Rashford. Man Utd haven't been at the level they'd want to be for the majority of that time. It's difficult for Rashford and where we place him really in terms of his Man Utd career, because there's been moments where he's looked fantastic. Other moments were really frustrating. Now we've heard from Ruben Amorim, a new manager coming into the club who can see his quality and thinks: 'I can get the best out of this player'. But lots of managers have said that before and they've not been able to do it for a prolonged period of time.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Football journalist Henry Winter: Ruben Amorim's comments after the derby were fairly indicative of a parting of ways. Obviously it's going to cause emotion because Marcus Rashford is homegrown, he's very talented, 60 caps for England. It's going to be a big story. Sometimes parting causes sweet sorrow, but sometimes it's necessary sorrow. I'm sure there will be a market - whether that be in Spain or Italy - because he's at that magical age for footballers where he still retains his athleticism but has got so much experience. Amorim wants to play a specific system and Rashford is adaptable, but reading the headlines today it looks like Rashford isn't in those plans. Sky Sports News' Melissa Reddy: In the absence of a market for Rashford, Amorim has been trying different methods to get a tune out of him. For so long, for example with Rash, you try a thing, it doesn't work, he said. Let's continue to do the same thing? Or something different? Being left out of the squad against Manchester City has so far had the desired effect of elevating the player's training standards and attitude. Rashford posted a photograph of United's celebration following Amad's sensational winner with the caption, Yesssssssss! Love it lads on social media. It was viewed as a nod to Amorim's comment that everything, including engagement with team-mates will be considered when he selects a match-day squad. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Sky Sports' Jamie Carragher: Most managers who come in, they want to send a message to the squad about the standards of the football club. In some ways it feels a bigger decision than it actually is. I mean, is Marcus Rashford in the best XI? How good is he? We're not talking about a world-renowned superstar here. I actually think we talk about Marcus Rashford too much, if I'm being totally honest. He's a good player, he's not a great player, he's been a really good player for Manchester United. It is time for him to leave the club, but whether there'll be any takers with the wages the lad's on and things like that, who knows. I just think a parting of the ways is inevitable at some stage, and I think for Manchester United and Rashford, the quicker that comes, the better.

Even the underlying numbers help to explain why this was an historic individual display. It was only the second time that any side has had more touches in the opposition box than Manchester City in a Premier League at the Etihad Stadium for which supporters were inside the stadium. They had 10 players for much of the other one and still won. But it was Amad's own numbers that were remarkable. Ten times he touched the ball in the opposition box, more than twice as many times as anyone else. It is over seven years since an opponent had more such touches in a Premier League game at City. It was a product of the urgency in his game - a naked enthusiasm that stood in contrast to much of the lethargy around him. Amad made 26 sprints in the game. Predictably, that was more than anyone else. He has brought some energy to Ruben Amorim's team. United are a team in flux under their new coach, a point illustrated by the decision to omit Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho from the squad for the Manchester derby. Amad had already earned Amorim's trust by making a fist of the wing-back role. That willingness to work back brought him his opportunity against City. With Noussair Mazraoui at wing-back against the Premier League champions, Amad was pushed into a more advanced role in the front three and seized his chance in spectacular style. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player It is a little baffling that Amad, the hero of their epic FA Cup quarter-final win over Liverpool in March, was not given more minutes under Erik ten Hag. He was on the bench for each of the Dutchman's final four Premier League games in charge. Stream Premier League with NOW Watch free match highlights Transfer Centre LIVE! Read our football features But Amorim has spotted someone willing to run for him. Amad has made 159 high-speed runs under the new boss, more than anyone else. The only Premier League game for which Amorim has left him out so far, at Arsenal, he brought him on at half-time. There is still a sense that few in this United squad are a natural fit for the system that this coach wants to use. But in demonstrating that he is an option in at least two positions already, Amad already looks to be the first big winner of the new regime.

That is unusual for a player as creative as Gibbs-White and what is really interesting about his performance is that it was not so high because he had opted to be more risk averse in his work in this particular game. It was just that everything he tried came off. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player The data from Genius IQ can track the locations of every player on the pitch to calculate the expected completion rate of each pass. Gibbs-White's pass completion rate was 10.49 percentage points higher than expected given the difficulty of those passes. No player over the Premier League weekend overperformed in terms of expected pass completion rate more than he did. He is the one who helps to move Forest up the pitch and provide that spark to their play and that was very evident in their comeback win. Even if Chris Wood's goal had not been disallowed due to Anthony Elanga straying marginally offside, Gibbs-White would not have been credited with an assist. But the build-up featured not one but two incisive passes by Forest's playmaker to set it up. Gibbs-White did get his assist for Nikola Milenkovic's equaliser, only his second of the Premier League season, having registered his first in beating Manchester United last time out, a game in which he also scored.

While that frustration is understandable, Doucoure also deserves credit for his role in his team's point. Everton became the first team to stop Arsenal scoring at home in any competition this season. It would not have been possible without Doucoure. The Malian's pressing game is peerless. He put pressure on the ball on 93 occasions in the match, far more than any other player over the Premier League weekend. Sean Dyche knows he is special. This is what he said about Doucoure last season. That energy and commitment to press and take the game higher up the pitch, he is very good at that. He can read the play. It is not just his energy it is also his awareness, his tactical understanding, the lines when he presses to stop the opposition from passing. Last season, those long legs ate up a total of 15.85 kilometres when pressing the opposition - more than any other Premier League player. Doucoure's quality on the ball can be hit and miss. But he always covers the ground. He is still important for Everton. Tom from Southampton became a millionaire for free with Super 6! Could you be the next jackpot winner?

8548,6C5A901A668A4FFD2D1DC50CA8C57C0A,Rangers should relaunch £5.8m summer bid for Brazilian talent as transfer need grows: view,https://cdn1.rangersnews.uk/uploads/24/2024/12/GettyImages-2039762646-1024x683.jpg,2024-12-18T14:15:00.000Z,Rangers News,https://www.rangersnews.uk/news/kaiky-fernandes-rangers-transfer-poser-as-club-hunt-defender-after-failed-5-8m-summer-bid/,"Rangers are on the hunt for a new centre-back this January as injury strips the Ibrox side’s defensive options down to the bare bones. Rangers already had limited defensive options this season with John Souttar’s availability and immense form a driving force at the heart of the defence. But with Souttar now sidelined for ‘several weeks’, Rangers are also counting the cost of a season-ending injury to Neraysho Kasanwirjo. The versatile Dutchman has been sent back to Feyenoord for the time being and whilst Rangers retain a transfer interest in Kasanwirjo, options are now limited. Leon Balogun and Robin Propper will be expected to hold the fort until January but when the winter transfer window rolls around, could the club revisit a failed summer move for a samba star? Cast your mind back to the summer transfer window and you will remember Rangers attempting to make moves to sign a new central defender. Panamanian centre-back Jose Cordoba had been given the Ibrox treatment but the Gers pulled out of a deal with Norwich City hovering. But the Canaries defender wasn’t the only one attracting the attentions of Nils Koppen and co with Brazilian centre-back Kaiky Fernandes another name strongly linked. As the transfer window wound to a close, Fabrizio Romano claimed that Rangers had launched a loan-to-buy bid to sign Kaiky from Spanish side Almeria. But the deal fell apart after Rangers refused to meet Almeria’s hefty demands on the 20-year-old, for whom they paid €10m (£8.3m) to sign from Santos in 2022. The story goes that Rangers had offered a €750k (£650k) loan fee with a €7m (£5.8m) future fee and 30% sell on to tempt the Liga Segunda side to sell. 🚨🔵 Understand Almeria turned down formal bid from Rangers for Brazilian 20 year old centre back Kaiky.Proposal worth €750k loan plus €7m and 30% sell-on clause has been rejected this week. pic.twitter.com/3F8xACelln Spanish outlet Ideal later reported that Rangers’ offer for Kaiky was around 70% of what Almeria paid to sign the defender two and a half years ago. Since those links to Rangers, Kaiky Fernandes has played a bit part role in Almeria’s La Liga promotion push this season. With Almeria 2nd in Liga Segunda, Kaiky has started seven out of 20 league matches this season following a loan spell at Alcabete last campaign. The defender is clearly highly-rated and being only 20-years-old has plenty of time to grow into one of those impervious Brazilian centre-backs we’ve seen over the years. But with chances limited at Almeria, and Rangers reportedly targeting a new centre-back this January, we wonder if this a deal the Ibrox side might consider revisiting. Rangers have an increasingly Brazilian contingent in their ranks in Glasgow, with left-back Jefte and striker Danilo beginning to win over the support."

Video assistant referee (VAR) officials failed to alert referee John Beaton that Liam Scales' tug on Vaclav Cerny's jersey appeared to occur on the line, rather than just outside the box. With the match poised at 3-3, Scales was booked for the offence and James Tavernier hit the resultant free-kick over the crossbar. With no further scoring at Hampden, the final was settled on a penalty shoot-out and Celtic prevailed after Kasper Schmeichel saved from Ridvan Yilmaz. Decisions will be wrong, that's a given, Maxwell told the Press Association without giving a specific answer on the matter. We'll eradicate them as much as we can. VAR has done that in a vast majority of cases. There are always going to be one or two that will fall out with that, because there's people involved and in anything that involves a person, there will be decisions that are incorrect. That's human nature. Celtic beat Rangers on penalties to win epic six-goal League Cup final Clement's phone 'overloaded with penalty' incident Maxwell added: This is the first time I've been asked this year about a VAR decision. It's not always been that way. Head of refereeing Willie Collum is expected to address the incident in his weekly VAR review on Thursday. Since Willie has come in, the transparency, the way he's dealt with things, has been a breath of fresh air, and made a real difference on and off the pitch and we want to drive that forward, Maxwell continued. Since football began, people have been talking about refereeing decisions, and we will talk about them forever more. And that's part of the game. There will never be a point where there isn't a contentious decision because people disagree on decisions. Rangers manager Philippe Clement called the incident - which took place early in the first half of extra time - a really decisive moment , going on to describe the absence of VAR intervention as weird .

The Rangers B side overcame Celtic 3-2 to lift the Glasgow Cup in an enthralling encounter which was eventually won by Zak Lovelace. Philippe Clement was in attendance at Queen’s Park’s City Stadium with several youngsters catching the Ibrox manager’s eye. Young Northern Irish goalkeeper Mason Munn has already made a big impression on the Belgian and has been training with the first-team this season. Whilst the highly-rated goalie’s progress will have been noted by Clement and Co, the 18-year old will have also impressed the Rangers hierarchy with his comments after the game. Mason Munn might be young but the Ulsterman knows exactly what it takes to play for Rangers. ”Just getting over the line is what you need to do in a Final,” Mason Munn told the Rangers Review after the game. ”And that’s what we done in the end but we did make it difficult for ourselves at time. ”Celtic are a young team, we knew that coming into the game but it wasn’t an excuse. ”Coming out of it we knew that we needed to win the game tonight with the team that we had and the starting XI so good that we won, but it’s final so it’s all you need to do. ”It’s an experience. This is things we need to do is to go and experience these games and to win. ”Because at Rangers that’s what you need to do, win finals and win big games. ”For us to get an experience of it now at this young age is massive so yeah, it’s all good.” Mason Munn has also been speaking about his time working with Rangers goalkeepers Jack Butland and Liam Kelly this season. Munn has been in and around the Rangers first-team squad as the Ibrox side look to take a more European approach to bleeding young talent. Explaining that his progress is all down to hard work and hard work alone, Munn has reflected on his time working with the Rangers stoppers in the men’s team. ”Jack (Butland) and Liam (Kelly) are two very experienced guys in the SPFL now,” said Munn. ”Liam being at Motherwell for such a long spell and Jack being in England squad playing in the Premier League. ”They both know what it takes so being around them every day and being around the first team and the manager, all those things for me are massive experiences. ”Travelling with the first-team, understanding what it takes to win a game of football, being around the changing room. ”Just loads of different experiences is good for me and I need to keep learning. ”(The advice is) just basic stuff. I think if you asked anybody out on the street what’s the takeaway from football, it’s just hard work. ”You can have all the talent in the world, you can have all the ability in the world but if you don’t work hard you’ve got no chance. ”That’s just part and parcel with the game, you need to work hard to get there.”"

Every ex-referee has confirmed the mistake and the SFA have admitted negligence, which gives Patrick Stewart grounds to take the matter further. An apology is too late, but could the new Rangers CEO follow the example set by Belgian side Genk when they took a costly VAR blunder all the way to the courts? With the score at 2-1, Genk were punished for encroachment when there were Anderlecht players inside the box too, the correct call should have been a retake – ironically, with Kasper Schmeichel in goals. Genk appealed, and were successful: “The disciplinary council for professional football has ruled that the Anderlecht – KRC Genk match at the end of last year should be replayed,” read a statement from the disciplinary council for professional football in Belgium in January 2024. “The Council then followed Genk’s argument that the match officials misapplied the rules at the penalty phase in question.” Genk then won the replay, which was the difference between making the play-offs for European football and missing out. 🖥️ De VAR geeft een penalty aan KRC Genk❌ Kasper Schmeichel redt vanop elf meter⚽️ Yira Sor scoort in de herneming🙅‍♂️ De VAR keurt het doelpunt afWat was dat allemaal? 😅 #ANDGNK pic.twitter.com/gmanAQvttG The problem for Rangers is that there is no compensation for VAR officials Alan Muir and Frank Connor making such a big mistake. The worrying thing is, if they can’t see why it was a penalty, should they really be working at the level that they are at? It was the easiest decision of the day to inform John Beaton that the foul on Vaclav Cerny was inside the box. Stewart has been a volunteer with the Court of Arbitration for Sport for several years, Rangers couldn’t have someone better to consider what action could be taken. A replay from the moment the penalty should have been awarded might sound far-fetched, but it has happened before, in 2015 with England women’s Under-19 team. Rangers might not get it, but they should push the replay narrative as far as they can and question the competence of those who potentially cost Philippe Clement is second trophy as manager. Being realistic, officials in Scotland will never allow such an intervention, unless they want to accommodate replaying every Celtic game in which they drop points or don’t get their way in the future that is."

When Gers winger Vaclav Cerny fell to the ground after a foul by Liam Scales during extra-time, referee John Beaton quickly awarded a free-kick. Replays have shown that the tug on Cerny happened INSIDE the box raising massive questions over why VAR didn’t award a penalty – as it was a factual decision that’s what should have happened rather than a review taking place. Reports today state the Scottish FA have already admitted their blunder to Rangers and that will be made public this week. Incoming Gers CEO Patrick Stewart had contacted the SFA to demand an explanation, as one of his first tasks in the hotseat. Of course it doesn’t change anything from the Ibrox club’s point of view but Stewart’s quick exerting of pressure seems to have worked. It comes after former referee Bobby Madden was among those insisting Rangers definitely should have had a penalty. SFA chief executive Ian Maxwell has now addressed the situation publicly. Maxwell claims VAR has made a difference in weeding out some of the poor decisions but human nature dictates they will still occur. And he insists they will continue trying to eradicate them further. Maxwell told PLZ Soccer: “Decisions will be wrong, that’s a given. We’ll eradicate them as much as we possibly can. “VAR has done that in the vast majority of cases, but there are always going to be one or two that will fall outwith that, because there’s people involved. “Anything that involves a person in any walk of life, there will be decisions made that don’t go the way we want them to, or are incorrect.

But former Celtic defender Mark Wilson revealed the decision seemed to be ‘brushed aside’ as he worked at the game as a pundit. Speaking on Open Goal, he said: “The factual decision is it’s a penalty, it doesn’t even need to go to the screen. “See at the time? Because where we’re sitting we’ve got the screen in front of us and it’s delayed like three seconds to what’s going on in the game. “So we look right away because you think ‘that must be close’. But the replay seemed so quick, we’ve we’ve even got the VAR because Lenny (Neil Lennon) and Alan Hutton is just in front of us doing the co-comms. “But I didn’t even see anything flash up. It was almost like it was just brushed aside.”"

In the space of only two days, Rangers and Celtic have played out a pair of truly sensational cup finals. But while Kasper Schmeichel’s penalty heroics broke Rangers hearts at Hampden Park following a six-goal thriller on Sunday, it was Celtic who found themselves on the wrong end of a dramatic conclusion just over 48 hours later. Zak Lovelace stepped off the bench to score the decisive goal in five, David McCallum’s youngsters triumphing in the rescheduled Glasgow Cup decider. Another plus, from those of a blue persuasion, was the long-awaited return of Oscar Cortes. At just 21, the Colombian winger is not much older than the baby-faced youngsters in McCallum’s squad. But he took on the role of an experienced campaigner on the night, featuring for the B team as Cortes looks to build up his fitness following an injury which has kept him out of action since September. There was nothing too spectacular on the night from Cortes, returning to Rangers on a £4 million loan-to-buy deal after a brief spell at Ibrox in the second half of 2023/24. What McCallum did enjoy, however, was the dogged determination Cortes showed when forcing The Gers’ early opener. He pressed the Celtic goalkeeper into giving the ball away inside his own penalty area before squaring for Paul Nsio to make it 1-0. A combination of clarity and ferocity. Paul Nsio gives Rangers B the lead! 🔵The mistake by Rice in the Celtic goal gets punished early in the Glasgow Cup final 👀@RangersFC @RFC_Youth pic.twitter.com/fdghc2dvVB “We had to do that at times tonight, and it’s important that their heads retain a certain level of calmness but also energetic and aggressive,” McCallum told the club’s official website at full-time with the trophy in his hands. “I thought we done that at times, although I thought we could do it more frequently. We have played games where we have been better for longer but not necessarily won those games. “I thought at the start of the game we took a little bit to get to our rhythm. We scored our goal probably when we weren’t at our best, but it came off the back of pressing from Oscar and we managed to get ourselves into a position where Paul scores.” And it finishes 3-2! 🔵Rangers win the 2023-24 Glasgow Cup 🏆@RangersFC @RFC_Youth pic.twitter.com/A9GltQGlGs Cortes has only featured three times since returning for a second spell in Scotland. In fact, he’s featured only three times since February. Rangers took a risk when deciding to bring Cortes back despite his injury-hit first stint, and it’s fair to say that risk is yet to be rewarded. Though, clearly, Cortes still possesses the dogged determination and the out-of-possession hunger – not to mention the creative qualities – that caught Rangers’ eye in the first place. Philippe Clement confirmed nearly a fortnight ago that both Cortes and fellow wideman Rabbi Matondo had returned to first-team training ahead of a long-awaited comeback, probably in early 2025. “Rabbi and Oscar were today, for the first time, in full training,” Clement said on September 7th, one day before Rangers cruised past Ross County in Dingwall. “They’ve been a long time out but it’s very positive news that they can do everything again. It was an intense training session with the guys who didn’t play [for a while] so that’s very positive news.”"

The outspoken former Celtic striker has been speaking about the situation involving the 22-year-old midfielder, who has been a key player for Rangers at times this season. Having moved to Ibrox at the end of his Aberdeen contract, Rangers are yet to agree a development fee with Aberdeen and the situation is set to go to tribunal. Outspoken Dons CEO Alan Burrows has recently criticised the tribunal process for dragging out as Aberdeen look to maximise their return on the Rangers midfielder. Now, Chris Sutton has incorrectly asserted that the progress Connor Barron has made at Rangers will result in the tribunal looking more favourably as a high Aberdeen pay-out. Speaking to the Press & Journal, Chris Sutton has been giving his two cents on Rangers’ move for Aberdeen midfielder Connor Barron this summer. Amid interest from the English Championship and Serie A, Rangers swooped to sign the Pittodrie talent at the end of his contract in the northeast. Had Barron moved abroad, Aberdeen would’ve been due around £525k in development fees but will look to get more given Barron has moved within the Scottish border. Chris Sutton reckons the Dons are looking for a veritable ‘fortune’ for the Rangers midfielder and that Barron’s early success at Ibrox will only add numbers on to his valuation. “It is strange and probably tells us how far apart both clubs are at with their valuations,” said Sutton. “Aberdeen have lost a good player in Barron and will want every penny they can. They will want an absolute fortune. “I know Barron wasn’t in Rangers’ starting XI for the Premier Sports Cup final but the better he does the worse it is for Rangers in terms of the more they’ll have to pay. “I can understand both sides of it. “However, as is typical at this time year, they’ll probably now put it (tribunal) to after Christmas.” The claim that the better Barron does for Rangers, the worse it will be for the club financially is a patently false one. Whilst Aberdeen are frustrated at the time it’s taking to put together an independent tribunal – who will rule on the fee Rangers must pay the Dons – the midfielder’s form at Ibrox is irrelevant. It is the tribunal’s job to decide how much Connor Barron was worth at the moment of transfer in the context of the Scottish transfer market, previous valuations, transfer interest and performances. At Rangers, Barron has been exposed to a higher level of training facility, management expertise and playing competition which will have had a tangible impact on his progress. The expectations at Rangers, combined with the environment, is also something which quite simply cannot be replicated at Pittodrie. This is best exemplified by Peterborough chairman Darragh MacAnthony, who explained the tribunal process south of the border amid Rangers links to Kwame Poku. “(Tribunals will) look at a lot of things,” said MacAnthony said on his latest Hard Truth podcast. “They’ll look at how long he’s been with you. They’ll look at the offers we’ve had. “A fair tribunal will look and go ‘yeah, you’ve spent £500k, you’ve developed him’ and the club that is trying to sign him they’ll look at it and go ‘that’s a big club with money, you’re going to have to pay whatever’. “So that’s how they would value that. (The fact we’ve made him a big offer) plays into it too.” So whilst it makes a good headline to suggest that Connor Barron’s early Rangers form is a double-edged sword, it should ultimately have no bearing on the tribunal’s decision-making."

That is clear. The SFA are set to admit there was a VAR blunder as officials failed to intervene after John Beaton awarded just a free-kick for Liam Scales’ tug on Vaclav Cerny. That has come after incoming Rangers CEO Patrick Stewart contacted the Scottish FA looking for answers over the debacle. And the SFA have also taken action on the VAR officials that cocked up as Alan Muir and Frank Connor have been dropped from this weekend’s Premiership fixtures. Immediately after the game, onlookers including former whistler Bobby Madden said Rangers had been done out of a “100% penalty.” Now, even a former Celtic star has echoed some of the comments and agreed Gers should have had a penalty. Wilson was working at the game and had eyes on the VAR screen that commentators get to watch alongside the action. The former defender points out as a factual decision, i.e. being inside or outside the box, it wouldn’t even need to go to a VAR review. But he says nothing even came up on the VAR screen as the decision just appeared to be glossed over. Speaking on Open Goal, he said: “The factual decision is it’s a penalty, it doesn’t even need to go to the screen. “See at the time? Because where we’re sitting we’ve got the screen in front of us and it’s delayed like three seconds to what’s going on in the game. “So we look right away because you think ‘that must be close’. But the replay seemed so quick, we’ve we’ve even got the VAR because Lenny (Neil Lennon) and Alan Hutton is just in front of us doing the co-comms. “But I didn’t even see anything flash up. It was almost like it was just brushed aside.” With The Scotsman claiming the governing body have already admitted the mistake to Rangers, that information will soon be made public. Referees’ chief Willie Collum is set to do his VAR Review Show this week and will address the issue then. While the Key Match Incident Panel’s findings will be published on Friday. The Scotsman reports adds that no explanation as been able to be given to Gers other than the officials making an error of judgement."

The B team might have been strengthened by the addition of Oscar Cortes and Rabbi Matondo from the senior squad, however, the fringe players stepped up to the plate when it mattered against Celtic. The Glasgow Cup is one of the oldest trophies in Scottish football and gives bragging rights to the academy players who compete for it with Rangers coming out on top, technically, for last season. A strong line up featured a lot of players who have been seen training under the watchful eye of Philippe Clement with the manager keen to introduce youngsters to first team training quicker to aid their development. In a frantic 90 minutes, here are the five main talking points. Zak Lovelace has already been given game time by Clement and the versatile forward will be hoping to work his way back into first team reckoning. On this showing, he remains a more potent threat than Ross McCausland, Kieran Dowell or Rabbi Matondo, who have all seen minutes on the flanks this season. He showed the desire, physicality, pace and composure needed to score a cup final winning goal – qualities that would have impressed the watching Clement. Zak Lovelace may have just won the Glasgow Cup for Rangers! 🔵It's 3-2 with the clock winding down 👀@RangersFC @RFC_Youth pic.twitter.com/qeVFQV52OU Oscar Cortes looked sharp. Usually, hamstring and thigh problems can lead to faster players losing a bit of speed, not so for the Colombian winger. He looks more athletic and took every opportunity to pick his knees up and put on the after burners, perfectly demonstrated with the opening goal. The 20-year old will be like the proverbial new signing. Paul Nsio gives Rangers B the lead! 🔵The mistake by Rice in the Celtic goal gets punished early in the Glasgow Cup final 👀@RangersFC @RFC_Youth pic.twitter.com/fdghc2dvVB Leon King and Robbie Fraser might not ever play 50 games a season for Rangers, but if their wages aren’t excessive for their respective roles in the squad, there is nothing wrong with them wanting to stay at the club. Some might think it shows a lack of ambition, but the grass isn’t always greener on the other side and having players who bleed red, white and blue in and around Auchenhowie is never a bad thing. Both were committed, determined to win and showed leadership throughout what was a tough defensive display. Clinton Nsiala arrived from AC Milan in the summer, and it was thought that he would form part of the senior centre-half corps. Instead, he has yet to play a single minute and has only been seen in sporadic B team fixtures. There is a rawness to his game, but there are also facets of his display against Celtic that suggest he could have a bright future at Rangers. His composure on the ball, pace and passing are solid attributes, if he can adapt to the frenetic nature of Scottish football. Rangers are to prioritise a centre-half in January, however, Nsiala could be trusted in the short term to provide cover. Where is Alex Lowry? The gifted playmaker was seen in pre-season fixtures and training videos but has disappeared off the face of the earth. There has never been any mention of an injury but it is the only explanation given his absence in this fixture. Out of contract at the end of the season, his chances of an extension and of fulfilling his potential seems less and less likely by the day."
8548,403418D571CF9FCD61EE949AD272540B,SFA give Rangers VAR Hampden penalty verdict with date set for details to be published,https://cdn1.rangersnews.uk/uploads/24/2024/12/GettyImages-2190065645-3-1024x659.jpg,2024-12-18T10:31:00.000Z,Rangers News,https://www.rangersnews.uk/news/sfa-give-rangers-var-hampden-penalty-verdict-with-date-set-for-details-to-be-published/,"Rangers are fuming after the failure to award the club a potentially pivotal penalty kick in the Old Firm Premier Sports Cup Final defeat to Celtic. Incoming Rangers CEO Patrick Stewart has contacted the SFA for answers as the Ibrox club are left reeling by VAR’s failure to intervene at Hampden. With Rangers awarded a free kick for a pull by Liam Scales on Czech winger Vaclav Cerny, replays prove the incident was actually inside the box. VAR should’ve urged John Beaton to point to the spot but for some reason hurriedly moved on from the incident and allowed James Tavernier to fire a free kick over the bar. As Rangers fans eagerly await an official response from the SFA, one report claims that Scottish football’s governing body is getting ready to hold up its hands. The Scotsman is claiming that the SFA have already admitted to Rangers that they made a grave error in not awarding the penalty kick at Hampden. There is swelling pressure on the governing body amid a run of high profile VAR interventions which have benefitted Celtic in recent Old Firm derbies. With officials reviewing Rangers goals or penalty shouts with a fine tooth comb, this time the officials glazed over the incident with the scores tied at 3-3 in extra time. The incident has been publicly criticised by several ex-referees, including the likes of Bobby Madden and Mike McCurry. Celtic would go on to win the match on penalties and the decision had a potentially pivotal outcome on the game, which has allowed the Parkhead side to overtake Rangers’ official trophy record. The Scotsman believe that the SFA have now ‘admitted’ the mistake to Rangers with the situation to be addressed publicly by Willie Collum in the SFA’s own VAR Review Show this week. Acknowledgment of the mistake will be published on Friday after a five-person committee reviewed the decision-making via the Key Match Incident Panel. Simply, the report says that the SFA have been unable to offer any other explanation to Rangers other than the fact the officials ‘erred’ in their decision making. It’s not clear if this will be enough to satiate Rangers or the club’s supporters, who’ve been left reeling by the incompetence of the SFA’s decision-making in the Old Firm fixture. VAR has been used almost exclusively in the Old Firm derby to find faults in Rangers goals or to defend Celtic when things have not gone their way. It comes against the backdrop of immense referee pressure from Parkhead, the club’s board, management staff and fans all nodding to conspiracy theories in recent seasons. For such a grave mistake to be made in a national cup final is unacceptable in the extreme and Rangers must push for sanctions which quite simply must lead to dismissals. There is no alternative and the VAR officials involved unfortunately must feel the gravity of their failure to correctly referee the match. Rangers CEO Patrick Stewart told supporters in his first interview at Ibrox that he is awaiting an official response from the SFA over the incident. “The match with Spurs really showed Rangers going head-to-head with a top Premier League side and it was a match we all felt we should have won,” Stewart said when asked about the current performance of Clement’s squad. “The performances in the SPFL have been really positive, we are scoring, not conceding, of course the Cup Final – I don’t want to dwell on it again, but it could have been such a memorable day. “We have a lot to be positive about. The manner in which we lost was hard to take, and as I think people will know, I have spoken with the SFA to ask for an explanation about the non-awarding of a penalty in extra-time, so I will wait to hear what the SFA have to say about that.”"
8548,665EDE4C8D613300AB2330AC3CAA10C7,Amad Diallo set for Manchester United reward as post-Rangers career takes off,https://cdn1.rangersnews.uk/uploads/24/2024/12/GettyImages-2190188079-1024x607.jpg,2024-12-18T10:00:00.000Z,Rangers News,https://www.rangersnews.uk/news/amad-diallo-to-be-rewarded-for-fine-manchester-united-form-as-post-rangers-career-takes-off/,"Amad Diallo’s time at Rangers may not have set the heather alight but he is now starring for Manchester United. The winger played 13 times for Gers during his half season loan from the Premier League giants. That included just seven Premiership starts and three Scottish Cup appearances, which to be fair ended with the trophy as Diallo started the final against Hearts. But Diallo has become a key Manchester United figure this season and stole the show in the recent derby win over Manchester City. He won a late penalty which allowed Bruno Fernandes to equalise and minutes later the Gers flop pounced to score the winner. Diallo has come to the fore for Man United under Ruben Amorim and he was one of four ex-Rangers men highlighted for shining elsewhere. Diallo is now poised to be rewarded for his fine form with a new contract at Old Trafford, according to ESPN. The former Rangers loanee is currently on a deal until next summer but there is an option within it to extend it by a year. However, it is being reported that the two parties are in talks about extending it further with a long-term commitment. It is claimed that talks have been positive and there are only minor details to be ironed out, with the Red Devils intending to make it official before the turn of the year. Diallo definitely showed ability at points during his time at Ibrox but didn’t quite put it all together consistently enough. He ended up with three goals, all coming in the league and two of them coming post-split. But it was his next loan spell at Sunderland where he really kicked on and showed what he can do properly. The Ivory Coast star was a revelation in the English Championship as the Black Cats came close to promotion. Diallo scored 14 times, including one in the play-offs, and added four assists as he finally started to look like he may make it at Old Trafford. Last season he was back at the Red Devils and got a few run outs but his lack of game time raised hopes of a potential Rangers return for Diallo. That didn’t happen and this campaign he has begun to play consistently. He is now looking like having a big future under Amorim’s guidance."
8548,0A8AD01E6597D723E96F4E842C436A6B,Zak Lovelace lauded for Rangers B starring show as first-team pair continue comebacks,https://cdn1.rangersnews.uk/uploads/24/2024/12/GettyImages-2180839443-1024x674.jpg,2024-12-18T09:00:00.000Z,Rangers News,https://www.rangersnews.uk/news/zak-lovelace-lauded-for-rangers-b-starring-show-as-first-team-pair-continue-injury-comebacks/,"Zak Lovelace has been hailed after climbing off the bench to win the Glasgow Cup for Rangers B. The B team beat Celtic 3-2 in the final at City Stadium in Mount Floriday last night, snatching it with a later winner of real quality from the young forward. The young Gers, who had returning first-team stars Oscar Cortes and Rabbi Matondo in their starting XI, opened the scoring after 15 minutes with Cortes setting up Paul Nsio for a tap-in. Celtic equalised before the break but Cole McKinnon restored the advantage with a well-taken volley. Another leveller came with just 15 minutes left on the clock but the stage was set for Lovelace. The 18-year-old got on the end of a long ball, flicked it over a defender’s head and then surging past the keeper before applying the finish. Lovelace got his first-team breakthrough last season but suffered a heartbreaking injury on his first start. There was excitement when he eventually returned to B team action but the young Rangers prospect then suffered another injury. Before that, Philippe Clement had instructed Lovelace to be subbed off while watching a B team game as he looked set to be handed a first team chance and did get a run out in the Europa League against FCSB. Rangers fans had demanded Lovelace’s involvement after seeing him steal the show against Stenhousemuir that night, but he picked up another injury. The teen talent has just made his latest return but was understood to be disappointed to not start last night’s final. Rangers B team manager David McCallum addressed that in his post-match interview. He insists it is normal to be disappointed in that scenario but insisted Lovelace was not yet ready to start the game. And he has lauded the youngster after the massive impact he had on the outcome. Zak Lovelace may have just won the Glasgow Cup for Rangers! 🔵It's 3-2 with the clock winding down 👀@RangersFC @RFC_Youth pic.twitter.com/qeVFQV52OU Asked if biding your time is part of being a player at Ibrox, McCallum told The Rangers Review: “Of course it is. I don’t think any player should feel that you’re entitled or guaranteed. And Zak wasn’t at that. I think he understood the situation. “But he also understood that he was going to have a part to play. Did we all know it was going to be the part that he did play? Absolutely not. But we knew he was capable of that. And I think he’s shown that. “He is a goal threat. He’s got a presence. He’s a finisher. He’s got a strength that he can run against the back line, which causes threats and causes problems. So he’s got a mixed variety of how he can impact the game. “But I actually quite liked the way he’s managed not starting the game. Like I said, I think every player should feel, as you’re getting towards the senior game, that you need to play, and it wasn’t the case with Zak tonight. “Zak’s obviously come back from injury, but you need to feel that you earned that moment. “Zak tonight, like I said, he got injured a couple of weeks ago. So he wasn’t ready to start the game and he knew that. The disappointment is fine. I think that’s okay.” Wingers Cortes and Matondo each played 45 minutes for the second string as they continued their return from injury lay-offs. Philippe Clement has been excited about getting the Gers duo back involved with the first-team and they continued their comebacks. Both were a thorn in the side of Celtic throughout the first 45 minutes, and McCallum revealed it was always the plan to sub them at half-time. He said: “Listen, they’re coming back again to come into the manager’s thoughts. And we spoke to the players before the game. “Every player had a different reason to be involved in the game tonight. For those two, they’re senior players. Full-Time at The City Stadium🏆 We are Glasgow Cup Winners!Rangers 3 – 2 Celtic | #GlasgowCup pic.twitter.com/hgeLGgdpTq “They’re a first-team squad. They’re coming back to prepare themselves to go and be available for the manager for team selection. “So other players for different reasons. So what we wanted from every player was to contribute to what was asked of them. So, but yeah, 45 minutes was always the plan.”"
8548,3ECED15DB544E76CCA03AD6A42D3F9D6,'We feel'... Robin Propper steps up but Rangers defender is still part of self-inflicted problems,https://cdn1.rangersnews.uk/uploads/24/2024/12/GettyImages-2186710842-1-1024x683.jpg,2024-12-18T08:00:00.000Z,Rangers News,https://www.rangersnews.uk/news/we-feel-robin-propper-steps-up-but-rangers-defender-is-still-part-of-self-inflicted-problems/,"There were more positives than negatives to emerge from Rangers defeat to Celtic at Hampden even if the ultimate low was a bitter pill to swallow. Players like Nicolas Raskin and Mohamed Diomande showed that they can be counted on with other members of the squad stepping up to the plate too. One of them was the much-criticised Robin Propper who stepped up to the plate and gave a glimpse of what he might bring to Rangers’ defence. The former Twente skipper could have been more composed in possession, however, he handled Kyogo Furuhashi and Adam Idah, keeping them as quiet as Celtic strikers have been for a long time in derbies. Speaking after the game, Propper was frustrated but had a prediction for the future: “It’s small moments”, reflected Propper. “In the second-half, we had a moment where we went four against one. “There are small moments to win the game. You need to take these moments, we did very well. “They had trouble with us, we were good on the counter attack, compact – we had a good plan today. It was an amazing game, only you want to have the medal and the cup. “In defence, we had three goals against us, that is too much in a game against Celtic. It is small moments to win these games, and in the end it is penalties – an unlucky one. “The last couple of weeks, we’ve improved. We’ve won our matches, you see today as well, we are not that far behind in the game. We scored three goals, had some chances. We feel that we are closer.” After no wins in seven and none under the management of Clement, the quality of performance is almost irrelevant in derbies. Historically, it has always been the case that the result is all that matters, but this is even more accurate now. Rangers did play well at Hampden, and Propper is right, but for the officials, they could have won. The biggest difference, is that Celtic wouldn’t have butchered the 4v1 opportunity to make it 2-0, nor would they have conceded three goals that were as soft. The small margins are what matter, and Rangers only have themselves to blame at both ends of the park."
8548,B26ACEAC244FF5131CC5696269F5A576,When Rangers could wear new Castore kit for last time if Umbro merchandise deal claim is accurate,https://cdn1.rangersnews.uk/uploads/24/2024/12/GettyImages-1243915934-1024x683.jpg,2024-12-18T07:00:00.000Z,Rangers News,https://www.rangersnews.uk/news/when-rangers-could-wear-new-castore-kit-for-last-time-if-umbro-merchandise-deal-claim-is-accurate/,"There isn’t a lot for Rangers fans to celebrate at the moment with Philippe Clement just about doing enough to keep his job. The manager is still skating on thin ice given the Scottish Premiership table but recent performances suggest that his vision could yet be fulfilled if he gets the squad that he needs. As with Rangers’ 150th anniversary, the 125th celebrations for Ibrox aren’t going to be the highlight that they maybe should have been, even if there will be something worth getting excited about. If the reports and rumours are accurate, Saturday’s fixture against Dundee could be the last Castore strip that Rangers wear. A deal with Umbro has allegedly been agreed, however, Castore are currently exclusively licensed to produce their merchandise. Rangers will be wearing a special edition home strip to face Dundee, unfortunately, unlike the 150th special edition kit, it won’t be sponsorless which kind of ruins the traditional look of what is another fine offering from Castore. The Ibrox fiasco in the summer didn’t help the mood around G51 and Rangers’ AGM saw the board come under fire for how they approached the redevelopment of the Copland Road stand. The original plan was for both the Sandy Jardine and Broomloan Road stands to get a similar upgrade, however, former interim chairman John Gilligan suggested that this work is now under review when he confirmed that the board: “…acknowledged that significant lessons had been learned, noting that the scale of the project was immense. “He suggested that in future, if works of this or larger magnitude were to be undertaken, the club might need to plan for a period without use of the stadium.” Increasing the capacity of Ibrox isn’t easy and this is one way of taking it from circa 50,000 up to nearer 56,000. It’s not a huge leap but it would help to close the gap on Parkhead’s 60,000 that gives Celtic an immediate advantage before a ball is even kicked. Hopefully, the new executive team are more efficient than the one that left a lot of problems to fix on and off the pitch."

Welcome to another edition of Fitzie’s Film and TV Reviews, where your hoddler-in-chief reviews some things he’s recently seen on the television and the big screen. We’ve got a special Christmas edition in store today. No, I’m not going to list every single Christmas special I’ve seen. It’s too long of a list and I’m not going to spend two hours writing on it. If you feel the need to write 250 words on Christmas with the Kranks or Bad Santa, please do so in the comments. Anyways, let’s get to it: The Holdovers: A tremendous film that was my favourite in 2023 (and the one I wanted to win best pic at the Oscars this year). It’s beautifully shot, I love the budding relationship between a surly Paul Giammati and a neglected pupil. Plus, Da’Vine Joy Randolph puts in the best role of her career. 5 out of 5 Fitzies Bad Moms Christmas: This is a stupid, fun movie. I don’t know how this happened, but I watch it every year now. Including on Saturday. I will watch Kathryn Hahn and Mila Kunis in almost anything they star in, so a film that has them both will of course draw my attention. It’s exactly what you’d expect from the film’s title. It’s about some bad moms trying to take Christmas back. We know how it goes. It’s fun anyways. 3 out of 5 Fitzies Spongebob Christmas special: Everytime I think of a Christmas special, my memory brings me back to this one. I’m not talking about the more recent attempts by Spongebob to create a Christmas episode. This episode is now 24 years old (season 2, episode 8). I will never forgive a nation that did not include this in the Top 100 Spongebob episode list in 2006. I love this episode so much. The festivity. The jokes (the donkey one I didn’t understand til much later). And, of course, an absolute banger of a track. It doesn’t get better than this. 5 out of 5 Fitzies Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer (1964): I didn’t like this one too much. The abominable snowman scared me as a kid, even when he became a good guy. When I got older, I still didn’t like him. Plus, everyone was such a jerk to Rudolph. 1 out of 5 Fitzies The creepy thing with the ice and fire monster: Please, no one talk about this. I still have nightmares about this one. There was a commercial, I think, sometime last year maybe that included the firey guy from this film and it brought back a lot of fear. I will never watch it again. 0.0 out of 5 Fitzies Elf: A modern-day classic that I was lucky enough to watch in the cinema when I was a youngling. It’s a wonderful Christmas film that gets watched every year. 4.5 out of 5 Fitzies Spirited: This is honestly solid, if a little too long. The songs are a bit much (a trope they make fun of, albeit in a too-meta way), and I don’t understand the love interest Will Ferrell’s character has. 2.5 out of 5 Fitzies National Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation: Yup, another banger. I love Doris Roberts, who plays a minor role. Some highlights from this film include the Christmas shopping, the blessing over Christmas dinner, the cop raid and so much more. 5 out of 5 Fizites Your generic sitcom Christmas episodes: I love watching Christmas episodes for sitcoms. They’re always so fun. We know that, mostly, they won’t challenge us too much. There’s a bit of extra comfort watching these. Did any sitcom do this better than 30 Rock? I don’t think so. The show aired five Christmas specials during this time, bringing a festive twist to its sharp-witted and quick humour. 3.5 out of 5 Fitzies A Very Murray Christmas: I’m not sure why I keep coming back to this one during the holidays, but I do. It’s not great, just alright. But it’s got tonnes of cameos. Chris Rock is probably my favourite of the bunch. Jenny Lewis and David Johansen are great too. Where the special really loses me is the Miley Cyrus bit. Not that I dislike it. It just feels so misplaced. Like, how did we get from a snowed-in hotel to this glitzy scene with Cyrus, Murray, George Clooney and Paul Schaffer? 3 out of 5 Fitzies Fitzie’s track of the day: Alone on Christmas Day, by Phoenix And now for your links: Vitor Pereira to become Wolves’ new manager The Athletic ($$): On the European Super League relaunching as the ‘Unity League’78 ESPN: How set piece specialists are thriving in the Premier League Rotten Tomatoes on the ‘100 greatest Christmas films of all time’ Gambling Problem?

According to The Athletic, Tottenham had appealed Bentancur’s seven match ban and was attempting to have it reduced to the minimum penalty of six matches. Had the club been successful it would have meant Bentancur would be available to play again in league action in the upcoming match against Liverpool on December 22. Bentancur has already served five matches of his suspension; as of now, the earliest he could return is the Boxing Day fixture against Nottingham Forest. Bentancur was suspended following a lengthy inquiry after a video emerged on a Spanish language YouTube video where he “joked” that his teammate Son Heung-Min and other South Koreans “all look the same.” The FA determined that he was in violation of FA policies and issued the seven match suspension and a £100k fine. Son has said that he and Bentancur have already resolved the issue and that he and the team consider the issue behind them. Bentancur has continued to play football for Tottenham in the Europa League. Gambling Problem? Call 1-800-GAMBLER (1-800-426-2537). Hope is here.

However, the appeal was dismissed following a hearing and Bentancur will miss matches against Manchester United in the Carabao Cup and Liverpool in the Premier League. The former Juventus midfielder has been able to play in the Europa League during his ban as it only applies to domestic competition. Anti-racism organisations Kick It Out and The Frank Soo Foundation have said they received more reports about Tottenham's decision to appeal against Bentancur's ban than the original incident itself. In a shared statement, the groups said they hope Spurs reflect on its decision as the episode has been upsetting for many fans .

The Uruguay midfielder was given the suspension by an independent commission on November 18 and two days later, Spurs indicated they would appeal. Spurs said in a statement they accepted the guilty finding against Bentancur but believed the subsequent sanction was severe. The 27-year-old was also fined £100,000 by the Football Association as part of the punishment. However, his domestic suspension will remain in place after the appeal decision, and he will miss Spurs' upcoming games against Manchester United in the quarter finals of the Carabao Cup and the Premier League clash with Liverpool on Sunday. Bentancur, who has still been able to play in the Europa League, has missed games against Manchester City, Fulham, Bournemouth, Chelsea and Southampton. He will be available to play again for Spurs in the Premier League at Nottingham Forest on Boxing Day.

An independent regulatory commission imposed a seven-match suspension on the Tottenham Hotspur midfielder for an aggravated breach of FA Rule E3 in relation to a media interview. This appeal was dismissed following a hearing and the seven-match suspension remains as ordered by the regulatory commission. Tottenham do not wish to comment on their appeal being dismissed. Spurs boss Ange Postecoglou will be facing the media tomorrow ahead of their Carabao Cup quarter-final against Manchester United on Thursday. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Bentancur was sanctioned over comments he made in an interview aired on Uruguayan TV in June. The former Juventus midfielder was asked to show the shirt of a Spurs player and replied: Sonny's? It could be Sonny's cousin too as they all look the same. While an apology from Bentancur was swiftly forthcoming due to it being an aggravated breach , an independent regulatory commission panel were required to either uphold the FA charge or dismiss the case. Son said he and Bentancur remained brothers and nothing had changed after the Uruguayan immediately apologised to him, admitting he had made a mistake . Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player I've spoken with Lolo (Bentancur). He made a mistake, he knows this and has apologised, the South Korea captain said. Lolo would not mean to ever intentionally say something offensive. We are brothers and nothing has changed at all. We're past this, we're united and we will be back together in pre-season to fight for our club as one. Anti-discrimination campaign Kick It Out released a joint statement with the Frank Soo Foundation following the FA Independent Appeal Board's decision to dismiss the appeal against Bentancur's seven-match suspension. Kick It Out received more reports about Tottenham's decision to appeal against the discrimination sanction for Rodrigo Bentancur than the original incident itself, the statement read. Many of the reports from the East and Southeast Asian community and beyond told us how angry and disappointed they were with the club's actions and how it extended the pain for those who were affected by the original incident. We know this has been an upsetting episode for many fans and hope the club will now reflect on its decision and how it might seek to engage with the community. The number of reports to Kick It Out over recent seasons shows that more education is needed to highlight East and Southeast Asian racism in football, and we would urge clubs to tackle this in the same manner as other forms of discrimination. We await the written reasons for the dismissal of the appeal with keen interest. Tom from Southampton became a millionaire for free with Super 6! Could you be the next jackpot winner?

I know it might seem strange, but I’ve been watching a fair amount of Belgian football lately. It certainly helps that Toby Alderweireld, Vincent Janssen and Jan Vertonghen all play in the league. It also happens to be the only football that’s on when I wake up on Sunday mornings (usually around 7.20am). So, yeah, I like to turn on the Belgian footy while I’m making my eggs and coffee, and getting ready for my run. This past Sunday I watched parts of Club Brugges versus Genk. The win actually had some big ramificatiosn for the table. With the 2-0 win, Club Brugges are now just one point back of Genk for the title race. Last Sunday, your hoddler-in-chief witnessed parts of Aldereweireld’s Royal Antwerp lose 3-1 to Charleroi at home. That’s a pretty bad loss. I haven’t seen much else of the Belgian Pro League yet, but consider me intrigued. I’ll continue to tune in and report. Belgian Pro League top six: 1. Genk (38 Pts, + 11 GD, 18 MP) 2.

The (a?) future of Tottenham Hotspur has arrived in London. 18-year old South Korean winger Yang Min-hyeok has arrived in London ahead of his signing for Tottenham Hotspur in January. It was previously announced that, after a short break at the conclusion of the K-League season, Yang would report to Spurs and begin training with his new teammates. | : - #Spurs new golden boy Yang is here! He touched down @ Heathrow recently & was greeted by fans. He even signed his first Spurs shirts in London! ✍️Welcome Yang! #양민혁 #thfc #coys pic.twitter.com/xAMQAKNfDf Yang also gave an interview before stepping on the plane in Seoul where he said he’s looking forward to getting to know his new club and new teammates, and will work hard, hoping to make it onto the pitch at least once sometime this spring. “[I feel] a mixture of excitement and anticipation. Ah, I couldn’t sleep well, so I watched the Tottenham match [the 5-0 win over Southampton] for a bit. “Tottenham has advised me to focus on recovery since I’ll be arriving after finishing my league season. They’ve also provided a training program centered around stretching and recovery. This will be my first time in London, so I’m excited and looking forward to going. “Initially, I’ll be adjusting with the help of my agent, and once I settle in, my parents plan to come over to live with me. My visa hasn’t been issued yet, so it might take about a week to sort out those matters. “My goal is to complete the remainder of the season without injuries, participate in matches, and contribute to the team with goals or assists. I haven’t set specific personal goals yet. I feel ready, and I’ll work even harder to show my best performance. I hope fans will continue to cheer for me. While I haven’t shown much yet, I’ll do my best, and I’m excited for this new chapter at Tottenham. I look forward to learning from senior players there and working hard to contribute to the team.” Sonny, meanwhile, spoke about Yang’s promise and said that “he’s not scared” of the opportunity. “He’s a similar age to Mikey Moore. Everyone loves Mikey and when Yang is here I hope everyone loves him like Mikey. He’s been fantastic in his first season in the K-League, scored 12 goals and a lot of assists. He’s bright. He’s not scared. “He’s a very bright player so I’m excited he’s coming here and I’ll try to help him as much as I can. But we just have to avoid putting pressure on him. The football side is the most important thing for him [to focus on].” Yang isn’t formally signed until the transfer window opens in January, and I’d personally be surprised if we see him at all, either on the bench or in a match, for a while. He’ll need time to adjust, to learn, and to train before we should even reasonably consider him ready to play, and that’s okay! It’s enough that he’s here now, and hopefully he’ll live up to his promise. Gambling Problem? Call 1-800-GAMBLER (1-800-426-2537). Hope is here.

When I was but a wee future Tottenham blogger growing up in northern Indiana, on special days when the weather got hot my parents would take my brother and I a couple of blocks down the road to Ray’s Ice Cream Parlor for a cone or a dish. It was always a special occasion, and while I didn’t appreciate it at the time, the opportunity to frequent a truly local ice cream establishment so close to my house was really special. I also didn’t appreciate at the time the fact that there are so many regional differences in ice cream flavors depending on where you are in the country. You tend not to do that when you’re seven. That didn’t really hit home for me until I was dating my now-spouse, who is from California, and both of us were like “You mean you’ve never tried [flavor]? What’s wrong with you?” So this week I did a dive into ice cream flavors that are unique to the Midwestern region of the United States. There are some really interesting ones! This is a theme that, once again, will almost certainly alienate our European readership, but that’s okay, they can all comment on the actual ratings this time and leave the ice cream discussion to the rest of us. Here are your Tottenham Hotspur player ratings to the theme of uniquely Midwestern ice cream flavors. This was one of my favorite flavors at good ol’ Ray’s Ice Cream. It started in Wisconsin, but can be found all over the Midwest. What does it taste like? Uhhhhhhh that’s the question. Nobody can quite figure it out, and the makers aren’t telling. Some say it tastes like a combination of mint, almond, and marshmallow. Others say it tastes like Froot Loops cereal. What I can say is: it’s very blue. And it’s delicious. I still buy it, and my California wife still gives me a side-eye. Pape Sarr (Community — 4.5): This was a match tailor made for Sarr’s abilities — lots of space behind, and a bunch of mostly crap midfield players to dribble around. Took his goal well and worked well with Bergvall in what felt like a true double pivot midfield. James Maddison (Community — 4.5): Say this for Madders — he’s not always on, but when he is on he is ON. Both of his goals were superbly taken, especially his second, and he looked creatively involved with almost every good thing Spurs did in the first half. Son Heung-Min (Community — 4.5): Two assists and a goal, plus he could’ve had a couple more had he been a little more clinical with his shooting. Looked electric, like the Son of old. And he did it all in one half! Pedro Porro (Community — 3.5): We all wanted Porro to get more of a rest on Sunday, but credit to him — as soon as he got on the pitch he looked committed to playing his entire shift without ever getting his pace up beyond a moderate jog. This is exactly what I wanted out of him in this match — why sprint when you’re already exhausted and Deki can cover behind you? It was perfect, and I admire his full commitment to the bit. Good job, Pedro. Five stars. Ange Postecoglou (Community — 4.5): We smooshed ‘em with two teenagers in the starting lineup, and Ange actually let them turn the intensity dial down a couple notches in the second half. Got Spence his first start, and Dorrington his club debut. Good managin’. Superman ice cream is a Michigan staple, and since I grew up close to the border, it was readily available in my area as well. While the ice cream is a swirl of red, yellow and blue — the same as Superman’s costume — it notably (and ironically) predates the superhero, emerging during prohibition. (The comic debuted in 1938.) The flavors can vary, but often is lemon/banana, red pop, and blue moon/raspberry. It’s super colorful, and for a young kid obsessed with comics, it was the perfect flavor. Dejan Kulusevski (Community — 4.0): Took his goal well, was very involved in and around Southampton’s box, and did a good job covering for Pedro when he’d amble forward every so often. Played all over the pitch, looked great. Djed Spence (Community — 4.5): Instant impact with his gorgeous turn and through ball to Maddison inside 40 seconds, and looked bright both in attack and defense. Capably dealt with a sudden flank switch after Udogie’s injury. He was good. We should probably play him more. Loathe as I am to give Nebraska credit for much, I do credit them for developing and popularizing butter brickle ice cream — a toffee-flavored ice cream with butter toffee pieces, sometimes covered in chocolate. It is uniquely Midwestern and incredibly delicious, like a Heath Bar in ice cream form. Yum. Archie Gray (Community — 4.0): While I would’ve liked to see him some at CM, this was a perfect game for him to continue to find his sea legs at the Premier League level. Another solid, composed performance in defense. Lucas Bergvall (Community — 4.0): Lucas still looks like he’s adjusting to the speed of the Premier League, but he also feels like he’s settling in. Plays with a hint of a swagger. Not every game will be this easy but again you can see his potential. You’ve probably heard of Moose Trax, which has escaped the Midwest and can now be found everywhere, but Bunny Trax? That’s an Iowa thing and they take it seriously. Vanilla ice cream with caramel sauce, fudge sauce, chocolate covered peanuts, and peanut butter bunnies. What’s not to love? Fraser Forster (Community — 4.0): Didn’t really have all that much to do, to be honest. A couple of routine saves and let one past that was called back for offside. Radu Dragusin (Community — 4.0): Solid enough defensive performance against an offense that didn’t generate much. Really enjoying seeing the long pass from deep in his locker lately, we haven’t had a player like that since Vertonghen. Destiny Udogie (Community — 3.5): A little hard to evaluate him after his injury substitution, but while he still looked gassed he had a pretty good match. Ahh, Kentucky. What’s their go-to move for any food item that’s pretty good? Add bourbon to it! Thankfully, bourbon goes great with vanilla and milk, so it’s a natural combination that adds complexity and depth to an otherwise bog-standard flavor. That said... it’s still just fancy vanilla, right? Dominic Solanke (Community — 3.5): Weird game. You’d think in a match where Spurs scored five goals he’d have at least one, but it felt like he barely had a sniff. No shots at all. Strangely complacent match, but maybe it’s just that he didn’t NEED to be as involved. Alfie Dorrington (Community — 3.0): Made his first team debut and was, on balance, pretty competent against a terrible offense. Had one misplaced pass that led to a Soton goal called back from offside, and looked distraught in the immediate wake of that, but this was the perfect game for him to make his first appearance. Would like to see more. Ok, I’m cheating a bit here because Grape Nuts ice cream is very much a northeastern thing, but it HAS made its way to the Midwest and I can specifically recall having it on trips to eastern Pennsylvania. The cereal gives a slight maltiness in the flavor profile and you do get that fun textural element, but I can’t say it’s the best thing I’ve ever put in my mouth. It’s not that it’s BAD, it’s just not as good as everything on this list above it. Brennan Johnson (Community — 3.0): Not sure what all he actually did out there, but I guess in his defense when you’re up five goals when you come on you don’t exactly have to tear up trees. Timo Werner (Community — 3.0): Mostly anonymous as a sub, but had one lovely cross into the box that Johnson put over the bar. The teaberry is the bright red berry of the wintergreen plant, and this bubblegum pink ice cream is one of the most popular flavors in Pennsylvania. Yes, it is minty. Aggressively so. I’ve had it once, I like the flavor of wintergreen, and I found it basically like eating frozen Pepto-Bismol. If that’s your thing, that’s cool but I’ll give it a pass next time I’m in the Lancaster County area. No Tottenham players in this category. I hate walnuts so this is an easy choice for me, and the black walnut takes the flavor profile of regular English walnuts and significantly dials up the earthiness and bitterness of the nuts in a way that isn’t offset by the sweetness of the cream. There are few ice creams that I would actively turn down if offered, but black walnut is one of them. Gross. No Tottenham players were as bad as black walnut ice cream.

But it appears Richy has at least one suitor. Poor Richarlison. The guy just can’t seem to catch a break. After picking up an injury right after the start of the season, he came back in November, played exactly one match, made a game-winning assist, and then pulled his hamstring, putting him back on the long term injured list. Richy also doesn’t seem destined to be at the club long. There was confirmed interest in him from Saudi Arabia last summer, which the player turned down, and Spurs seem interested in listening to offers for him as Postecoglou continues to retool the side to fit his tactics. So a new report that Fluminese president Mario Bittencourt has confirmed in a press conference today that he’s interested in bringing Richarlison back to his old club in Brazil has piqued my interest. Richarlison spent two seasons at Fluminese, scoring 17 goals in 54 appearances, and setting up his eventual move to Watford. As reported in Brazilian outlet Globo, Bittencourt said that he’s trying to open negotiations with Spurs for a transfer for Richy, and while there’s nothing imminent, Tottenham has not closed the door. “Tottenham responded that they are open to the offer. But that they are not currently interested in getting rid of the player. But they are willing to listen. We are also talking to the player to see if he is interested in returning. “What is certain is that we have expressed formal interest in Richarlison. We know how difficult it will be to bring him. But we believe that he may want to be close to the Brazilian national team, to return home, to the club where he stood out. “I have a close relationship with him. I was the vice-president of football when he arrived. The head of scouts (Ricardo Corrêa) was the head of scouts in 2016, he was the one who suggested the signing when he was the top scorer in Serie B. I was the one who brought Richarlison in as the vice-president of football. We have created a relationship, not a friendship, but a strong one. We have drawn up an initial document with the English club, without an offer yet, but asking if they would like to negotiate.” The report makes it clear that Spurs aren’t necessarily champing at the bit to send Richy away, but the fact that they’re willing to listen to offers is pretty telling. Bittencourt’s further comments make it sound like he might have the cart a bit in front of the horse, hinting that there might be possibilities for a large wage but low transfer fee arrangement, or the inclusion of some young Fluminese talent as makeweight. And you can’t say Bittencourt isn’t swinging for the fences, considering one of the other names he seems interested in bringing back to Brazil. “Our optimism lies in offering the athlete a project in which he can regain his brilliance. His personal achievements. There are no financial negotiations underway. If there are, we have interesting assets, especially young ones. This could be part of the operation. We have not mentioned any names, there is nothing concrete, but English clubs are looking for our young players from time to time. We can talk about preferences, priorities for the future, but it is still very embryonic. “If all this conspires, plus the gods of football, the great Tricolor fans who are with us in spirit, if everything helps, there are two players who would be a dream. Our Pombo, Richarlison, if he wants to, the doors are open. And another who has not played here, but who I admire as a player, who is a player everyone would like to have, is Neymar. If one day we have the conditions, who knows... Richarlison played here and knows the wonders that the fans can do” Now look — there isn’t much here that suggests that Richy is packing his bags. He’s certainly not going anywhere in January unless he’s able to make a significant recovery from his current injury. But I can see a situation where Richarlison would be interested in returning to Brazil so he can potentially get back into the national team, and Spurs working out a deal for a very low transfer fee so they can get him off the books and bring in Richy’s replacement this summer. This article makes it all sound very loosey-goosey, and it is. But that doesn’t mean it’s not at least moderately plausible, if Richy wants to make a change. That said, nothing about this makes it sound as though anything is imminent, so keep your powder dry for now. Gambling Problem? Call 1-800-GAMBLER (1-800-426-2537). Hope is here.

When Son set up Pape Matar Sarr to put Spurs up 3-0 in the 25th minute, Sonny also became Tottenham’s all-time assist leader with 68 assists, dislodging club legend Darren Anderton from the top spot. Cementing his legacy Sonny is now the all-time Premier League assist leader for the Club with 68! The past couple of years have been remarkable in that we’ve seen two records fall that some wondered might never be beaten. Anderton’s record of 67 career assists had stood for 30 years, and it feels likely that Sonny will run that record even higher before he hangs up his boots at Spurs. And of course, a couple years ago we watched Harry Kane become Spurs’ all-time leading goal scorer, ahead of the late, great Jimmy Greaves. We already know Son’s destined to become a Spurs legend himself, but this just cements it — he’s a Tottenham record holder now. Build the statue (after you finish Erik Lamela’s, of course).

Ajax began the game on top but they missed two early chances and that was eventually punished by Lazio. In the 12th minute, Pedro set up Loum Tchaouna to fire past Remko Pasveer. Before the break, Brian Brobbey missed a good chance but early in the second half, Bertrand Traore finished well to make it 1-1. However, Lazio regained their lead quickly with Fisayo Dele-Bashiru netting from close range.

The Amsterdam-born striker enjoyed a relatively steady rise through the amateur ranks of USV Hercules, DHSC and semi-pro TOP Oss, before an impressive spell with Fortuna Sittard brought the attention of Hellas Verona and now Lazio. In his press conference appearance in the run-up to this heavyweight Europa League battle, Noslin spoke of his recent rise, and of course, an intriguing run of form that saw him notch an impressive hat-trick against Napoli in the Coppa Italia. Tijjani Noslin scored a great hattrick last night as #Lazio beat #Napoli 3-1 in the #CoppaItalia 🎩 Not bad going from the former Fortuna Sittard striker 💥pic.twitter.com/n0da9Wcfpf With those heights mentioned though, even the novelty of chatting with the press isn’t lost on the 25-year-old. “It’s a huge honour, I’ve never experienced anything like it. I’m really curious about the questions that will come.” And of course, he gets those questions. Because Noslin’s story is special. For a working and studying amateur footballer, reaching the Eredivisie at Fortuna Sittard was of course already unimaginable. So, to reach solid heights in Italy? Even better. “Football is very much alive in Rome. In certain places, there are a lot of fans who want to take a picture of you, but that’s not a problem.” Following his brilliant trifecta against the Neapolitans – the cheerful attacker explained that, given his upbringing, he has not struggled to adjust to life in Italy. “I think it has to do with my life, with how I grew up. When you go through different difficult periods from a young age, it can help you. The things you learn on the street and at home, you can also take with you into football.” Tonight, Noslin has a very special chance to prove himself against Ajax. “Of course, you want to show everyone what you can do. Of course, you are also in your own city, where many family and friends come to watch. Then you always want to show something extra against Ajax. We are going to give everything.” The Amsterdam native has clearly absorbed Italian football culture in his one year in the country and could make things difficult for Francesco Farioli’s side tonight. “The most important thing is that we win. The way we win doesn’t matter.” GBeNeFN | Max Bradfield @2023 - All Rights Reserved. Get Football Group"

Farioli praised his striker at the pre-Lazio press conference. “Brobbey is in the fittest phase of his Ajax career.” When presented with the remarkable win percentage for his side when Brobbey starts (86%), Farioli continued. “The data also shows that he can play a lot of minutes, at high intensity.

Farioli, however, did not want to hear anything more about the word ‘tired’. “Anyone who talks about that will get a fine. So I will not use that word anymore.” Still aware to the issue, however, the Italian boss carried on: “Unfortunately, we cannot give anyone time off because we play every two days. We have to find the energy and motivation from within.” On the statuses of Jordan Henderson, Mika Godts and Devyne Rensch, Farioli hinted. “They are all OK, so they will be there on Thursday.” GBeNeFN | Max Bradfield @2023 - All Rights Reserved.

Groningen 0-0 PEC Zwolle Groningen and PEC Zwolle played out a 0-0 draw in the Euroborg. The hosts had the better chances in the first half but Thijs Oosting couldn’t convert two good opportunities that came his way. The match was more open after the break with Dylan Vente having a goal disallowed for PEC Zwolle, while Stije Resink and Romano Postema both had huge chances for the hosts before the end which weren’t taken. Groningen are in 14th and PEC Zwolle one spot above them. AZ Alkmaar 2-1 Ajax AZ Alkmaar defeated a toothless Ajax in the AFAS Stadion on Sunday. The hosts were by far the more threatening side in the first half but Ruben van Bommel hit the post while Remko Pasveer denied Ernest Poku. After the break, Wout Weghorst seemed to give Ajax the lead but he worked the ball into the net off his hand and it was disallowed. Van Bommel hit the post again before Troy Parrott tapped in a Peer Koopmeiners cross to finally make it 1-0 in the 64th minute. Mayckel Lahdo then doubled the lead with a header from a Koopmeiners corner. Ajax pulled one back from the returning Mika Godts but AZ held on to claim the three points. AZ is still 6th while Ajax are third. Willem II 1-2 Heerenveen A 94th-minute winner handed Robin van Persie his first away as Heerenveen head coach. The first half was forgettable with neither side creating many chances and it took until the 85th minute for the opening goal. Heerenveen got a penalty for a foul on Alireza Jahankbakhsh and Ion Nicolaescu converted. Willem II equalised quickly with Jeremy Bokila heading in but deep into injury time, Luuk Brouwers won it for Heerenveen. The win moves Heerenveen to tenth while Willem II is in 12th. Almere City 1-3 Utrecht Utrecht claimed second spot after a win over Almere City. Ajax dropping points earlier on Sunday gave Utrecht the chance to reclaim second and Ron Jans side made no mistake. Yoann Cathline hit the woodwork for Utrecht before Mike van der Hoorn netted from a corner to make it 1-0. An excellent strike from Zidane Iqbal then sealed then doubled the lead before the break. Logan Delaurier Chaubet pulled one back for the hosts but Noah Ohio sealed the victory for Utrecht in the 94th minute.

This news arrived as Ajax boss Francesco Farioli revealed the progress of a number of injured Amsterdammers in his pre-match press conference. “Godts’ recovery is going well and I am positive towards Sunday.” “With Devyne Rensch it is a bit more complicated. If he can participate in the last training, he will be available on Sunday. Otherwise we will look at the next match.” Injury update:✅ Mika Godts is fit again and could play against AZ on Sunday.❓ Devyne Rensch is still a question mark, If he can take part in the final training session, he will be available on Sunday. Otherwise, it'll be against Lazio on Thursday.#Ajax | #azAJA pic.twitter.com/RSNKHuVLOL In other news, Sivert Mannsverk will definitely not be there. “He will first get minutes with Jong Ajax.” Following these comments, the Italian looked ahead to the duel with AZ, saying, “(they are) a team with qualities and good organization.” “We are going to prepare ourselves as well as possible. I hope to see a bit of sharpness again that I have missed a bit in the last few games. With a good freshness in our minds, we have to make sure that we regain control on the field.” Previously, the manager addressed the injury situation with restraint, citing the stacked calendar as a potential reason for some of his player’s knocks. “The number of matches we play is high and we have to finish the last duels well. We shouldn’t look at the upcoming matches with pain, but with pleasure.

The scouts will pay close attention to 24-year-old Oğuz Aydın, who has been heavily linked with a move to the Amsterdam club due to his past with head coach Francesco Farioli. Oğuz Aydın joined Jose Mourinho’s Fenerbahçe last summer from fellow Süper Lig side Alanyaspor. Farioli was his previous manager and is now reportedly interested in linking up with the winger at Ajax. However, the Eredivisie giants face competition from several other European sides. Scouts from Rennes and Sevilla are also set to attend Saturday’s derby, focusing on Aydın. The Türkiye international joined Fenerbahçe for around €6m, meaning a higher fee would be required for him to leave. A January move for the forward seems unlikely given the short time he’s had at the club, but a switch next summer could potentially be on the cards.

In the match against FC Utrecht, the 41-year-old keeper was credited with an own goal, making him the oldest player ever to do so in the Dutch league. Domstedelingen’s Yoann Cathline smashed the post with a rock-hard shot just over ten minutes from time, yet the ball ricocheted rather unkindly and struck the back of Pasveer to find the net. As a result, the Ajax goalkeeper is now the oldest player ever in the Eredivisie to have scored an own goal.

As Voetbal International report, it seems the Italian has clear explanations for the recent dip in performance. After the draw against Utrecht, Farioli was asked at the press conference how it was possible that Ajax was able to step on the gas against Feyenoord and PSV, but his team looked tired on Wednesday night. “That was five or six games ago, and you can calculate how many minutes ago that was. We are missing Mika Godts now and also had problems with Wout Weghorst and Brian Brobbey. So it is logical that you pay the price for that somewhere. More rotation? More than this is impossible (laughs).” Ajax, who were on the rise, suffered setbacks again against Utrecht. David Min took the lead for the visitors before an Anton Gaaei wondergoal and an own goal from Jens Toornstra gave the hosts the lead.

FC Utrecht 2-5 PSV Eindhoven PSV Eindhoven put five goals past Utrecht in what could have been a tricky tie for the Eredivisie leaders. After the comeback victory in the Champions League in midweek, PSV had a clash against a potential title rival to overcome. Ismail Saibari put PSV ahead in the 12th minute with a close range header. A handball from Johan Bakayoko gave Utrecht the opportunity to equalise from the spot after 34 minutes and Anthony Descotte made no mistake. Malik Tillman had a goal disallowed before the break but Guus Til made it 2-1 in the 54th minute. Saibari then made it 3-1 after a lovely attack. Bakayoko finished off a swift counter to make it 4-1 before Siebe Horemans headed one back for the hosts. Til quickly added a fifth though with a fierce strike before Armando Obispo had a sixth disallowed before the end. An excellent win for PSV, who move 8 points clear at the top while Utrecht sits. AZ Alkmaar 1-0 Heracles Almelo AZ Alkmaar left it late to seal a slender 1-0 win over Heracles Almelo. AZ hadn’t sealed a home win in the league since September and in the opening stages they struggled to create chances. Ruben van Bommel did get a chance but he shot over the bar. After the break, the hosts were in control but Alexandre Penetra, Seiya Maikuma and Sven Mijnans all missed good chances to break the deadlock. It appeared it was going to be a 0-0 draw but in the 89th minute, Maykel Lahdo fired in the winning goal. A huge relief for AZ, who sits sixth while Heracles is in 15th. FC Twente 3-2 Go Ahead Eagles FC Twente came from 2-0 down to earn a 3-2 win over Go Ahead Eagles. After the poor loss to USG in the Europa League, Sam Lammers was restored to the starting line up for Twente as they looked to get back to winning ways. Sem Stein missed a huge chance early on before Lammers hit the crossbar. Against the run of play, the visitors struck in the 24th minute as Jakob Breum found the net with a long range strike. Nine minutes later, Breum made it 2-0. After an intelligent backheel from Steijn, Lammers pulled one back for FC Twente just before the break. Twenty minutes before the end, Steijn made it 2-2 with a wonderful volley and then Bas Kuipers netted the winning goal against his former side. Twente are now fifth while Go Ahead Eagles is in 8th. NEC Nijmegen 1-2 Ajax A double from Wout Weghorst led Ajax to a 2-1 victory over NEC Nijmegen. NEC made a strong start to the game and it wasn’t a shock when the opening goal came in the 13th minute. Remko Pasveer made an initial save but had no answer to Sontje Hansen on the rebound. The equaliser came two minutes later as a fine move ended with Weghorst finishing after good work by Kenneth Taylor. NEC then had a number of chances but Pasveer kept the hosts out before the break. Early in the second half, Jorrel Hato played Taylor in and he set up Weghorst to put Ajax in front. The crossbar then ensured Ajax stayed ahead as it denied a header from Dirk Proper. Chuba Akpom missed a big chance for Ajax late on but they still managed to take the three points. Ajax climbs to second while NEC is in 10th. 48.

The midfielder is said to be showing insufficient intensity on the pitch and also refusing to extend his contract. De Jong has had many problems with injuries over the past year and a half, and while the Dutch international has recently been seen on the pitch again, the higher-ups as Barça are reportedly frustrated with De Jong, according to the Spanish outlet. The Spanish giants believe that the former Ajax player does not show enough aggression and intensity. In the report, Fermín López, Gavi and Marc Casadó are mentioned as examples who do this well in contrast. Barcelona believe that De Jong has not yet lived up to his price tag of 85 million euros. In addition, according to Diario Sport, the midfielder refuses to extend his contract and the Catalan club are afraid that he could leave for free in 2026. De Jong made the switch from Ajax to FC Barcelona in 2019. He has played 221 matches for the Spanish powerhouse, scoring 17 times and recording 21 assists.

Football-Oranje's Michael, Mike and Abdul react to the Nations League ... Teachers across the United Kingdom (myself included) are giving their first parents’ evening of the year. I thought I would take this opportunity to reflect on the start of each Eredivisie team, giving them an old fashioned school grade from A-F. 1st PSV Eindhoven A We expect a lot from our star pupil who sits top of the class, and they have largely delivered. PSV have only dropped points once so far, and they have scored 45 goals already, averaging 3.5 per game in the Eredivisie. Now we want to see further progress in the Champions League. 2nd FC Utrecht A+ Massive progress! The wins keep coming for Utrecht. There are no spectacular names on the team sheet, but motivation under manager Ron Jans is sky high as they continue to grind out results. Fans are dreaming of Europe. 3rd Ajax A– Another team taking great strides under a talented manager. At times the average performances have been covered up by the excellent results; though rather like a pupil with poor handwriting and presentation, the content is the most important thing. 4th Feyenoord C A mixed year so far. Highlights of a Dutch Super Cup win and impressive away days in the Champions League have been let down by some sloppy work in the Eredivisie. However, if Brian Priske’s men can go on a run of results from here, they are still in the title race. 5th FC Twente B After a disappointing start to the year, Twente have picked up some good results keeping them firmly in the European spots. A feeling that there is more to come. 6th AZ Alkmaar C- Youthful exuberance does little to mask what has been a frustrating past month or two for AZ Alkmaar. A winning run to start the campaign was followed up by one win in nine in all competitions. A win at Sparta in the last game gives hope that there is a change in fortunes coming. 7th Go Ahead Eagles B- The Eagles earnt the privilege to play in the Conference League back in the summer but they were quickly found to be out of their depth. Back to Eredivisie business, and some positive recent results have propelled the Eagles back into the playoff positions. 8th Fortuna Sittard B A side that ‘does their homework’ and picks up enough points to stay out of trouble. If progress continues, we may see a European push from Danny Buijs and co. 9th NEC Nijmegen C Some early disappointment for NEC has been quelled by three wins in six, giving hope of another season in the playoffs and a run in the Dutch Cup. 10th Willem II B After being promoted to the top class in the Netherlands, Willem II have been a sensible outfit thus far, conceding the fewest goals out of all sides in the bottom half. 11th NAC Breda B+ Another new Eredivisie classmate who is performing above expectations. There were concerns over NAC’s defending, but they have been picking up wins thanks to their brilliant support at home. 12th Heerenveen D+ Promised much, but delivered very little. Heerenveen love to attack under Robin van Persie, but there is little focus on the defensive aspect of their game. Some flashes of potential have been coming through from the likes of Trenksow on the wing. 13th Heracles Almelo C Heracles are just about keeping up. Quality from De Keersmaecker in midfield and the likes of Hornkamp and Kulenovic in attack will make sure they keep their heads above water. Sometimes the negative tactics away from home can hinder further progress. 14th PEC Zwolle C Another team doing what is expected of them without really pushing on. Despite being some people’s tip for relegation at the start of the campaign, PEC have been largely stable so far, and they nearly picked up a result at Ajax in their last match. 15th FC Groningen D It is difficult to be too harsh on a team that has just been promoted to the top flight, but most thought highly of Groningen’s return, especially after some early positive results. Since then, it has been a defensive calamity and sometimes a lack of effort too. 16th Sparta Rotterdam E Despite having all the right tools for success, Sparta have not been maximising their potential at all. Keeping a host of fine players over the summer led to Jeroen Rijsdijk getting the sack because of the club’s high expectations. Maurice Steijn has returned to the club he left before joining Ajax, and so far has not experienced much joy. 17th Almere City D– Almere are struggling and are looking out of their depth at this level. New signings haven’t delivered and it seems a matter of time until the manager is changed. Six goals scored in 13 games is the worst record in the league, with 12 goals the next fewest in the Eredivisie. 18th RKC Waalwijk E A very poor disciplinary record, so it is no wonder they are bottom of the class! Six red cards is double their nearest ‘competitor’ this season in this regard. A lack of quality all of the pitch will mean a difficult year ahead. Writer/interviewer/YouTuber for Football-Oranje.

Football-Oranje's Michael, Mike and Abdul react to the Nations League ... Below is a round up of all the action from the four Eredivisie ties on Sunday. NEC Nijmegen 1-2 Utrecht Utrecht’s excellent start to the season continued on Sunday as they saw off NEC Nijmegen. After half an hour, Yoann Cathline opened the scoring for the visitors with a fine run and finish. Just after the break, NEC equalised thanks to an incredible solo goal from Sontje Hansen, who raced from his own area into the opposition box before finishing. Utrecht restored their lead through Victor Jensen, whose header was misjudged by NEC keeper Robin Roefs. NEC then laid siege to the Utrecht goal but they could not find the equaliser and Utrecht made it three wins in a row. Utrecht are second and NEC sits 9th. Sparta Rotterdam 1-2 AZ Alkmaar Maurice Steijn’s second game in charge of Sparta also ended in defeat. A new look AZ saw Dave Kwakman, Kees Smit and Mexx Meerdink all start and they took the lead early on with an excellent long-range strike from Peer Koopmeiners. Sparta responded quickly and Tobias Luaritsen placed a shot past Jeroen Zoet to make it 1-1. Patrick van Aanholt and Lauritsen then hit the woodwork for Sparta, who dominated the first half without taking the lead. The game seemed to be heading for a draw but Sven Mijnans popped up in the box to fire AZ to victory over his former team. AZ remains sixth while Sparta is 16th. Willem II 2-2 NAC Breda Willem II scored a 98th minute penalty to earn a draw against NAC Breda. NAC Breda dominated the opening stages and it was no surprise when Leo Sauer made it 1-0 after half an hour. Before the break, Clint Leemans should have made it 2-0 but hit the post with the goal gaping. Eight minutes into the second half, NAC did make it 2-0 as Leo Greiml headed in from a long throw-in by Jan Van den Bergh. Jesse Bosch quickly gave Willem II hope with a deflected strike. Willem II then poured forward as they looked for an equaliser and they thought they had it when Jeremy Bokila struck but VAR intervened and ruled it out for a handball. Then late into stoppage time, Terence Kongolo caused a foul in the box and Willem II got a penalty which Bokila converted. Willem II are 10th and NAC sits 11th. Ajax 2-0 PEC Zwolle Ajax recorded a victory over PEC Zwolle to keep up with Utrecht and PSV Eindhoven at the top of the table. PEC Zwolle had the better of the opening stages with Dylan Vente and Dylan Mbayo both going close. Around the half hour mark, Ajax took the lead with Brian Brobbey tapping in after good work from Kenneth Taylor and Davy Klaassen. PEC Zwolle remained a threat but Ajax doubled their lead after an hour with Josip Sutalo heading in. Sherel Floranus had a goal disallowed for offside as PEC Zwolle could not find a way back into the game and they paid for wasting several chances. Ajax remains third while PEC Zwolle is in 14th. 63.

8560,33D1CEAE46225DDF1A06D1AD6FE2B085,City find Rodri’s replacement in LaLiga and want to sign in January,https://img.asmedia.epimg.net/resizer/v2/2UUG5AGEY5DLXJ2TDBY5EFKH44.jpg?auth=784a3376aacace030dfe461412943c583cc50d8d2c3f81e9d33d70e264da4094&width=1472&height=828&focal=2479%2C411,2024-12-13T20:23:15.000Z,AS,https://en.as.com/soccer/city-find-rodris-replacement-in-laliga-and-want-to-sign-in-january-n/,"Premier League The cogs are whirring at City HQ as the flashing lights keep everyone awake inside the bunker, as does the shouting. Scuttling shoes can be heard clacking on the hard floor as they rush around, unfurling huge maps onto even bigger tables and pinning them down with yesterday’s dirty cups of cold tea. The war room in the Etihad Stadium is at DEFCON 1; Manchester City need to find space to breathe, fast, and recent developments hint that they might have done just that. A huge budget frozen out of reach until January has been a question mentioned in whispers as Christmas rolled into the field of view: will City make a move in January? Will they be forced to spend big to dig themselves out of this hole? It helps that they, would you believe, posted record income (!) for the past year, meaning gold coins have been found somewhere and the war chest is brimming. Their plan of action, if reports are to be believed, has been given the green light as a multitude of fingers are said to be pointing in the same direction on the maps: northern Spain. Manchester City are reportedly looking at Real Sociedad midfielder Martín Zubimendi as an emergency replacement for the injured Rodri, the general on the field that they have been missing as they have gone on their 1-win-in-10 run. At first glance, 25-year-old Real Sociedad midfielder moves differently to the gracefulness of the migrating giraffe that Rodri is, shirt smartly tucked in as he confidently strides and roams. Instead Zubimendi is a flitting, darting kingfisher: just as graceful but in a different way. The second side to the same coin; a darker blue to the City shade, but the same essence. Xabi Alonso on Zubimendi“He has that ability to generate play, to make those around him better, always offering solutions; to improve the move. He understands what the next step is before the ball gets to him. He has that ability to organise, the axis.”pic.twitter.com/zRZ8DGpcnE Zubimendi’s stats might not even cause you to rub your eyes: FBref don’t have him piercing the 70th percentile in any short passing stats. Or goals. Or assists. But what a deeper dive into the player on the pitch shows is one thing: everywhereness. And not in the Orwellian sense of Big Brother, not that scary feeling, but one of talent: the knowing where-and-when to pop up, when to move, when to hold, when to magic your way out of somewhere dark. He has top-tier numbers in progressive passes, shots on target, his medium passes, and passes blocked. He’s neither a goalscorer nor a defensive giant: he’s everything, and at least as graceful as Rodri in doing it. Some may remember that Zubimendi substituted Rodri in the Euros final against England, coming on at half-time after the City player got injured. Some of you may not, and that’s because he filled in so perfectly it was like, ahem, Spain didn’t even need their first choice lynchpin. Of course they would have liked to, but Martín did just as good of a job and showed to the continent what LaLiga fans had been enjoying all season: he’s a damn good footballer.

The German coach now adopts a far more cautious approach when it comes to squad rotation, changing at most, two members of the personnel per game. The Barça manager is expected to do the same for Sunday’s away game against Real Sociedad with the German hinting that Lamine Yamal is due a rest with the teenager missing out on first team training on Saturday. Pau Cubarsí is expected to start despite having nine stitches in a cut sustained in Belgrade and Dani Olmo may start despite the player also missing out on Saturday’s training session due to gastroenteritis. Despite the minor tweaks, Flick will field a very competitive team at the Real Arena with Iñaki Peña to remain between the posts, and despite conceding two goals in Belgrade, the young keeper still has the full confidence of the German coach. Few changes are expected at the back especially if Cubarsí‘s availability is confirmed but early signs point to Alejandro Balde returning to the left flank after being substituted in the Champions League with both Íñigo Martínez and Jules Koundé are fixed in the starting eleven. Real Madrid Soccer In midfield, Pedri and Marc Casadó will start, with the possibility of Fermín returning to the starting line-up, although Frenkie de Jong cannot be ruled out either. In attack, there are also two immovable names at the moment: Robert Lewandowski and Raphinha, who are also the team’s top scorers, with 19 and 12 goals, respectively. The third attacking force could be Dani Olmo, assuming he recovers from the stomach bug with Ansu Fati a potential replacement for the former Leipzig player.

Galatasaray are mounting an all-out pursuit to persuade him in the next couple of weeks. According to Calciomercato, should La Joya depart, the Giallorossi would attempt to sign Giacomo Raspadori. His entourage is shopping him around in search of a better situation playing time-wise. However, Napoli aren’t necessarily on the same page. They rejected a €25M offer plus €10M add-ons from Atalanta last summer. Therefore, the bid would have to be very rich to make the Azzurri alter their stance. Roma could stand pat in January if Dybala left considering they acquired his heir apparent Matias Soulé in the summer, shelling out €25M to get him from Juventus. He has struggled so far. In addition, they had brought in Tommaso Baldanzi, who plays in a similar role, last January. Per Tuttomercatoweb, the Giallorossi have a primary target to replace the Argentine, Omar Marmoush, but they can’t sign him in January because they have filled the two slots for extra-EU purchases. He’s expensive, but that won’t deter the capital club. He has posted 18 goals and 12 assists in 23 games across all competitions this season. One of the counterpoints against his departure is that it wouldn’t open up a lot of economic resources. They haven’t been great so far, but they technically already have the men to fill in for him. Plus, it’d be hard to find somebody with the same star power in January. Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked * Comment * Name * Email * Website Δ"

The strangest thing is that, looking at the GPS data, we ran more in the second half against Como than we did in the first.” “Someone said that maybe the team was tired from the Cup match, but nothing could be further from the truth. We ran and sprinted more in the second half, but not as a team, but as individuals. Como, on the other hand, played as a team and beat us, rightly so.” “This is my mandate: to find players willing to give their all on the pitch, always. Just as the fans don’t like it, I don’t like it either, because deep down I’m a fan too. I can’t stand this alternation of attitudes. I always want the best, and if I can’t get it, we have to intervene.” These were the words of Claudio Ranieri in the lead-up to Wednesday’s match against Sampdoria in the Coppa Italia round of 16. In this one, Ranieri will have to find the right combination to get past the Serie B side after Sunday’s disappointing defeat at Como. Unfortunately for Ranieri, some of the changes will be forced, especially in the midfield, where he will be without Cristante and Koné. “Tomorrow Hummels, Cristante and Kone will be unavailable. We’ll have some forced rotations in the midfield.” In addition to Hummels, who is out with an illness, the defense will also be without Gianluca Mancini, who is suspended for this match. I convocati per #RomaSamp#ASRoma pic.twitter.com/cgUUAtgwN1 With all of that in mind, Zeki Çelik is expected to slide into the three-man backline with Evan Ndicka and Mario Hermoso. Meanwhile, the forced changes in midfield will see Niccoló Pisilli team up with Leandro Paredes in the center of the pitch. They’ll be flanked by Saud Abdulhamid and Angeliño. In the attack, Artem Dovbyk will return to the starting XI. Who he is supported by is likely the only question mark in this XI with some combination of Lorenzo Pellegrini, Matías Soulé, Tommaso Baldanzi, and Alexis Saelemaekers. We’ll tip the two youngsters to get a shot to shine against the Ligurian side. ROMA (3-4-2-1): Svilar; Çelik, Ndicka, Hermoso; Abdulhamid, Pisilli, Paredes, Angeliño; Soulé, Baldanzi; Dovbyk.

Carlos Novel, one of the agents of the Argentine, traveled to Turkey to talk with the board. He watched the match against Trabzonspor from the presidential box, Corriere dello Sport informed. According to the local press, La Joya is seriously considering joining the Cimbom. On the other hand, he’s closing in on an automatic renewal thanks to his recent run of starts. His wages will balloon to €8M annually, add-ons included, once that happens. The Giallorossi have never contacted his entourage to discuss a different type of contract. Galatasaray want to sign Dybala for free or by paying a small fee. It almost happened last summer when Al-Qadsiah tracked him. The Argentine might find it easier to accept a move to Turkey compared to Saudi Arabia. Per Gianluca Di Marzio, the Cimbom offers €10M per year. The star doesn’t want to leave unless the club publicly pushes him out. Claudio Ranieri commented in a presser (via SOSFanta). “I only want players who are happy to be here. I haven’t perceived anything of the sort from him.” According to Sports Digitale (via AdnKronos), intermediary George Gardi, who arranged the Victor Osimhen, Nicolò Zaniolo, and Mauro Icardi transfers, will meet with the Giallorossi soon. Stranger things have happened, but the Roma owners would really have to go scorched earth to consider offloading their best players for cheap. Plus, he’s been reluctant to leave even when it could have made sense and wouldn’t have looked like a captain jumping ship while it’s sinking. Get rid of em both. Dybala was an amazing player whose time has passed. He ain’t worth €8million per season. Always hurt and hasn’t performed well in ages. Pelligrini is an average, whiny diver who is dismal as the skipper. Happy to see both go. We should throw in Cristante for free to cinch the deal. Your email address will not be published.

Plenty of star power turned up at the Stadio Comunale G. Sinigaglia on Sunday in Como. From Keira Knightley to Adrian Brody, there were plenty of big names in attendance. Unfortunately for Roma, none of the stars who turned up happened to be wearing giallorosso, and Como came away victorious against a toothless Roma. The loss kills any momentum that Roma had built up from back-to-back wins over Lecce and Braga. Consequently, the voices of premature exits for some of Roma’s longest-tenured players have grown louder. We discuss that and more in the latest episode of Across the Romaverse.

Paulo Dybala may have come into Rome like a conquering hero, but he looks increasingly likely to sneak out the back door in January, at least according to reports out of Turkey and later substantiated by Sky Sports’ Gianluca Di Marzio. After a seven-year stint with Juventus, Dybala, 31, signed a three-year deal with Roma in 2022. Dybala hit the ground running for the Giallorossi, scoring 34 goals and adding 17 assists during his first two seasons with the club. This season, La Joya and the Giallorossi have struggled in kind, with the club plummeting toward the relegation zone while Dybala's numbers have dried up: only two goals and one assist in 18 appearances in all competitions. With seven more appearances, Dybala's contract will automatically be extended for another season, and given his decreasing rate of return, Roma may look to hasten his exit. As first reported by journalist Yağız Sabuncuoğlu, Turkish club Galatasaray may look to accommodate Dybala and Roma by signing the Argentinian forward next month. The Corriere dello Sport claims that, with a €10 million contract offer on the table, Dybala's agent, Carlos Novel, has flown to Turkey to discuss the finer points of the deal. Dybala remains committed to Roma but would, based on these rumors, accept the transfer if the club deems it necessary. This isn't exactly the ending we envisioned when Dybala was serenaded by Roma fans at the Palazzo della Civiltà Italiana two summers ago, was it? Gambling Problem?

While they believe they have found the right guy on the bench and will continue to back him, they are ready to intervene heavily on the squad in January, La Gazzetta dello Sport informed. The patrons are particularly irate with those who have been at the club for a long time. They’d like to bring in a breath of fresh air and change the mentality. Every option is on the table. A lot of players are expendable. Roma will be open to listening to the offers for stalwarts like Bryan Cristante, Lorenzo Pellegrini, and Gianluca Mancini, but also Stephan El Shaarawy, Leandro Paredes, and Paulo Dybala, who aren’t under contract long-term. Moreover, they could part ways with those who are underperforming or not starring regularly like Mario Hermoso, Nicola Zalewski, Enzo Le Fée, Zeki Celik, Tommaso Baldanzi, and Eldor Shomurodov. Still, it won’t be easy to find new landing spots for them since most have considerable wages. It was a pretty baffling slip-up as they had seemingly turned the corner and the fact that the Lariani had looked overmatched in previous matches. Still, it’s hard to find continuity with some many changes. The versatility of a lot of their men can be a double-edged sword if it leads to constant tweaks that don’t allow to build the right mechanisms. Ranieri has to settle on an XI and let it marinate.

Gianluca di Marzio has reported about the Gala move for the Argentine, stating that La Joya is a player that they have wanted for about two years now and he is seen as a potential replacement for the injured Mauro Icardi. The player’s agent Carlos Novel was in Istanbul to watch the match against Trabzonspor and had various meetings with Galatarasay, also to talk about other young Argentines but the pressure for Dybala persists. The offer to the player is at around €10 million. Dybala’s will, however, is not to say goodbye to Roma in January, unless the club publicly decides to sell him and therefore release him. Galatasaray’s desire would be to have an operation without compensation for Roma, since Dybala ‘s contract expires on June 30, 2025 and the renewal would only be triggered by certain appearances. A possible renewal under different conditions is a topic that has never been discussed between Roma and the Argentine so far. Kaustubh Pandey I GIFN @2024 - All Rights Reserved. Get Football Group"

Yesterday's 2-0 loss to Como was frustrating for several reasons. Not only did the defeat halt Roma's two-match winning streak, but it came in the most Roma Happened way possible: a stoppage-time winner. While the 90 minutes preceding Alessandro Gabrielloni’s match-winner weren't exactly enjoyable, the Giallorossi seemed poised to leave Como with at least one point intact. After seeing multiple chances go wanting (primarily via setpieces because, in the run of play, Roma was neither running nor playing), Roma capitulated at the bitter end. And as if that wasn't bad enough, Como tacked on another goal in the 96th minute with nary a Roma defender in sight—it was certainly a night to forget for the capital club. Even though Roma suffered a shocking defeat and is now just two points above the relegation zone, it's not all doom and gloom. The way Como took charge in the second half is worrying, yet it doesn't resemble the defeats under Ivan Juric when hope was but a distant memory. Roma remains in Claudio Ranieri's safe hands, but they let three essential points slip through their fingers on Sunday. As one might have guessed, given that outcome, today's S&S is a bit light on halos. Despite conceding two late goals, the latter of which was essentially a four-vs-one fastbreak, Svilar stood on his head yesterday, making multiple acrobatic saves and turning in the only noteworthy performance for the men in maroon and gold. Facing 18 shots in total, Svilar made five saves, including two in the box, while making one high claim. Unfortunately, the list of saints ends there... We'll cut Larry Pilgrims some slight slack here—he only played 28 minutes, after all. Still, only a few days removed from a saintly performance against Braga in the Europa League, Pellegrini laid an egg during his cameo against Como. Brought in to ostensibly give the Giallorossi a spark in a scoreless game, Pellegrini wasn't up to snuff, completing only 79% of his passes, featuring a paltry two forward passes, and turning the ball over four times in only 16 touches. With a €30.5 million price tag and over five million in annual wages, it's fair to expect a bit more from your star striker than four goals in 14 league appearances. Roma's attack has sputtered this season, but is Dovbyk the chicken or the egg in this scenario? Whether we're talking about expected goals, actual goals, shot attempts, or shot accuracy, Dovbyk's numbers (on a per 90-minute basis) are down compared to his 24-goal campaign with Girona last season. And yesterday was no different. In 45 minutes, Dovbyk only took 14 touches (losing possession eight times) and failed to register a single attempt on goal. Roma sunk a lot into Dovbyk, and if they stand any chance at climbing out of the almost basement, to say nothing of returning to the Champions League someday, he has to grab the bull by the horns and start asserting himself. Neither sinner nor saint, these players occupied the messy middle ground yesterday. Gambling Problem? Call 1-800-GAMBLER (1-800-426-2537). Hope is here.

Roma just failed to convert and are now only two points above the relegation zone. After stitching together a pair of victories last week—a 4-1 romp over Lecce on Sunday and a 3-0 blanking of Braga in the Europa League—Claudio Ranieri and his charges headed north to the picturesque shores of Lake Como to square off against Cesc Fabregas and I Lariani. While a victory today wouldn't cure all of Roma's ills, winning three matches on the trot felt impossible as recently as two weeks ago. Little by little, Ranieri is chipping away at the hole created by Ivan Juric and restoring Roma's confidence. However, today's result proved that Ranieri's restoration job may be more complicated than we imagined. Despite their mini-winning streak, it wasn't all smiles before kick-off today. Roma was forced into a last-minute change in defense when Mario Hermoso replaced Mats Hummels (fever), joining Evan Ndicka and Zeki Celick in central defense. Rounding out the starting lineup were Angeliño, Saud Abdulhamid, Manu Koné, Enzo Le Fée, Alexis Saelemaekers, Stephan El Shaarawy, and Paulo Dybala. A lineup without any of Lorenzo Pellegrini, Bryan Cristante, or Gianluca Mancini is a rare sight in Rome. Still, even without those traditional stalwarts, Ranieri's lineup featured plenty of pace, agility, and firepower. However, despite going heavy on the attack, Roma struggled in the run of play throughout the first half. Rushing up and down the pitch was no issue, but they couldn't quite pick out that final pass once they reached the penalty area, resulting in plenty of wasted possession. That isn’t to say Roma's attack was toothless; they just chose a different path. While Como's backline did well to bend but not break, Roma's constant forward pressure produced multiple corner kicks early in the match. In the 5th minute, Mario Hermoso nearly drew first blood when he redirected a Dybala outswinger towards the near post, narrowly missing the opening goal. Alexis Saelemaekers followed that up a minute later with a lashed attempt off a Pepe Reina parry, only to see his effort skirt just wide. Next up was Zeki Celik, whose volleyed attempt slipped just over the crossbar. Como punched back several minutes later when Nico Paz's free-kick pulled Svilar from his slumber, only to see the ball sail past his fingertips and off the crossbar, sparing Roma an early and unexpected deficit. Como made our hearts skip a beat moments later when Gabriel Strefazza scooped up an errant throw-in and tested Svilar again, only to come up short. With time ticking away in the first half, Roma again turned to Dybala for setpiece inspiration. Teeing up a free kick near the edge of the box, Dybala nearly stole a last-second goal but couldn't get quite enough swerve on his free kick to evade Pepe Reina's gloves, sending both sides into the dressing room scoreless. Despite his already attack-heavy lineup, Ranieri doubled down to begin the second half, bringing striker Artem Dovbyk into the mix in place of El Shaarawy. While the formation didn't strictly change, this allowed Dybala to drop deeper into the hole behind the Ukranian striker rather than leading the line himself as a false-nine. Ranieri's tinkering was almost rendered moot early in the second half when Lucas da Cunha nearly beat Svilar in the 48th minute with a left-footed attempt off a corner kick. Como came close the next minute when Yannik Englehardt sent an attempt wide of the mark. Como continued to creep into this match as the second half wore on, testing Svilar in the 55th minute with a stinging effort off a tight-angled free kick, forcing the Belgian keeper into a finger-tip save. Roma wasn't necessarily derelict in their defensive duties at this point, but Como came out of the gates swinging to start the second half and stretched the Giallorossi back line seemingly at every turn. Ranieri responded to Como's resurgence with a triple change just past the hour mark: Lorenzo Pellegrini, Niccolo Pisilli, and Gianluca Mancini came on for Saelemaekers, Saud, and Le Fée. Although these weren't purely defensive adjustments, they gave Roma greater balance on the field and added strength at the back to counter Como's growing offensive threat—not a second too soon, as Patrick Cutrone flicked a header just wide of the far post moments after this change. Como continued their second-half onslaught when Paz tested Svilar from distance, forcing the Roma keeper into another save from 25+ yards out. Whatever switch Fabregas flipped at half-time was working; Como was outshooting Roma 9-0 by the 75th minute. Dybala came close moments later when Angeliño found the Argentine whiz in the middle of the penalty area, only to see his effort bounce wide of the mark—he was subbed off in the very next breath, adding insult to potential injury. The yeah-buts and almosts continued as the match crept towards the 80th minute, with Pellegrini picking out Mancini on a free-kick only to see another chance wasted. With time winding down, Paz again struck fear in the hearts of Roma fans, putting a sensational effort just wide of the mark in the 83rd minute, pushing their second-half total to 11 attempts on goal, while Roma was seemingly content with just one shot in the second half—sigh. You don't have to be a lifelong Roma fan to know what happened next... Goal Alessandro GabrielloniComo [1] - 0 Roma pic.twitter.com/Y2kyRPqjW3 Thanks to some poor defending from Pisilli and a somewhat late reaction from Ndicka, Alessandro Gabrielloni scored a stoppage-time winner, while Nico Paz added a second goal after Roma had essentially closed for the evening. As much as this defeat stings, we must credit Como—Fabregas played this perfectly, scheming his side back into the match and outshooting Roma 14 to 1 in the second half and 18 to 6 overall. Despite Como essentially flipping the narrative on its head in the second half, three easy points were on the table for Roma tonight; they just couldn't grab them. From Kone’s disallowed goal to the multiple setpiece SNAFUs in the first half to Mancini’s miss to Dybala’s almost picture-perfect free kick and even his late miss in the penalty area, Roma squandered the scant chances they managed to create. Ultimately, given everything that's plagued the club this season, their margin for error is razor-thin—if they even have one at all. Thanks to today's defeat, Roma and their nearly €100 million in annual salary commitments are a mere TWO POINTS ABOVE THE DROP. Roma returns to the Coppa Italia with a home match against Sampdoria on Wednesday the 18th. Gambling Problem? Call 1-800-GAMBLER (1-800-426-2537). Hope is here.

Can the Giallorossi notch their third straight win in all competitions? In nearly any other year, an away fixture against lowly Como wouldn't give Roma fans much pause. However, nothing has been easy for the Giallorossi in this most chaotic of seasons. From multiple managerial changes to missed calls to the usual spate of injuries, Roma has faced a continuous uphill battle in 2024. But there is hope on the horizon. After kicking off this third stint in charge of Roma with two predictable defeats to Napoli and Atalanta, Claudio Ranieri is slowly but surely rebuilding the Giallorossi's confidence. Between those two domestic defeats came an impressive 2-2 draw against Tottenham in London, which, coupled with the club's back-to-back victories over Lecce and Braga, has Roma back on the right foot. If Ranieri can keep the good times rolling today in Como, Roma has a good chance at heading into the holiday break riding a five-match heater, provided they can topple Sampdoria and Parma next week.

I convocati per #ComoRoma#ASRoma pic.twitter.com/DSfp2n1A5a The absence of those two means that Niccoló Pisilli should be in line to start next to Manu Koné in the center of the park. It’s expected that those two will be flanked by Angeliño and Saud Abdulhamid—who is coming off back-to-back strong performances on Roma’s right flank. Ranieri is expected to continue with the 3-4-2-1 formation that has created plenty of offense over the last two matches (seven goals). In those matches, Roma started Paulo Dybala as a false nine, which seems likely to continue with Artem Dovbyk starting from the bench. If that is indeed the case, Dybala will likely be supported by Thursday’s standout performer—captain Lorenzo Pellegrini—and Alexis Saelemaekers. Mario Hermoso came off the bench to score Roma’s third and final goal on Thursday against Braga. However, it’s expected that Ranieri will run back the trio of Gianluca Mancini, Mats Hummels, and Evan Ndicka from the opening whistle.

8686,20587D4B1E82F6935C78ED73530F365C,Roma Looks To Keep Good Times Rolling With Win Against Como,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bCw_Eh3bUnuukC2zp2hnxx5yp40=/0x215:3000x1786/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25789943/2189603149.jpg,2024-12-14T17:22:39.000Z,Chiesa Di Totti,https://www.chiesaditotti.com/2024/12/14/24321146/como-roma-match-preview,"Filed under: The Giallorossi are down a few players for this one, but that shouldn’t stop them from securing three points tomorrow. Don’t look now, but the Giallorossi are finally starting to string together some good performances. While Roma is still only in twelfth place, their last two matches across all competitions were emphatic wins, defeating Lecce and Sporting Braga by three-goal margins. Claudio Ranieri’s start to his third stint with Roma might have been rough going, but thankfully I Lupi now have a run of matches against slightly weaker competition that might just allow them to climb up the standings. With that in mind, tomorrow’s match against Como doesn’t have the highlight-reel potential of earlier clashes against Napoli and Atalanta, but given the fragile nature of this squad, I’m perfectly fine with that. Roma needs to rediscover itself, and going up against dangerous opponents now would probably just send the Giallorossi back to square one. Roma needs to build confidence and consistency—two qualities they’ve sorely lacked this season. Tomorrow is a chance for Roma to prove that their recent wins weren’t flukes but the beginning of a much-needed revival. Paulo Dybala has often struggled for fitness; it’s the price you pay for having such a talented player in your squad. Yet recent matches have given the Giallorossi one of their longest streaks of consecutive matches from La Joya, and tomorrow’s match will give them their fifth match with him in a row—the longest streak he’s had since January. According to Corriere dello Sport, Ranieri is leaning toward Dybala to lead the line over Artem Dovbyk, who’s still recovering full fitness. While Dovbyk’s physicality and ability to stretch defenses are certainly key assets, it’s a good sign that Ranieri trusts Dybala’s creativity and killer instinct to unlock Como’s compact backline early on. Moreover, this match presents a prime opportunity for Dybala to build confidence and rhythm. If Dybala can stay fit and maintain form, he might just be the catalyst Roma needs to climb up the standings and mount a serious challenge in the Coppa Italia. As goes Dybala, so goes Roma; his ability to influence matches with a moment of brilliance could be the difference between a resurgent campaign and another season of missed opportunities. This has been a transformative week for Saud Abdulhamid. Prior to Roma’s match against Sporting Braga, many Romanisti thought that Abdulhamid was a long-term project at best; the jump from Al Hilal to Roma is a huge one, and his lack of playtime and form to date wasn’t terribly surprising. But that match against Braga night changed the narrative in a big way. Not only did Abdulhamid become the first Saudi player to score in a European competition, but he also delivered a mature and assured performance that sparked a fair amount of excitement. Suddenly, the question isn’t whether Abdulhamid can adapt to life in Serie A—it’s whether he could be Roma’s long-term solution at right-back. The timing couldn’t be better for Abdulhamid to stake his claim. Zeki Celik has struggled for consistency his entire time in Rome, leaving Claudio Ranieri searching for alternatives on the right flank. According to La Repubblica, Abdulhamid will likely be rewarded for his midweek heroics with another start in Sunday’s match against Como. Playing as a right wing-back in Ranieri’s 3-5-2 system, he’ll have another opportunity to showcase the energy, defensive solidity, and attacking instincts that were on full display against Braga. If Abdulhamid can deliver another standout performance, he could cement himself as a short-term fix and a cornerstone for Roma’s future. If he can be that solution, it will simplify Roma’s January mercato planning. Instead of desperately needing a new starting right-back, Roma can focus on building out depth at striker and maybe even finding a long-term solution at left-back—something Roma needs just as much as they need a starting right-back.

Speaking to the press in the build-up to Saturday’s Premier League clash against Fulham via Calciomercato, the Dutchman confirmed the former Juventus winger lacks regular first-team action. Chiesa left Turin to join Liverpool in a £10 million deal in the summer after being deemed surplus to requirements by new Juventus manager Thiago Motta. However, he has only collected 78 minutes on Merseyside this season across three cameo appearances. Low in the pecking order, Chiesa could soon request a transfer, with several Serie A clubs vying for his signature. In addition to long-term admirers Inter, Milan and Roma are keen on bringing the unsettled Reds star back to his homeland. “What he needs is to play, the problem is that if he hasn’t played for five or six months, sometimes it’s difficult for a coach to give him his first minutes because you don’t exactly know what to expect,” Slot said about Chiesa. “Yes, I see him on the training pitch, but ideally, it would be better to see him in a friendly during the week, or in an Under-21 match or something like that. But this is not our situation: we play so many matches. So maybe the game against Southampton could be a good moment for him to get some minutes on the field, and then we’ll know a bit better what we can expect from him. “If you only have training sessions, it’s not the same as game time. You need game time to reach certain levels of fitness. But if you are fighting for the championship and fighting in the Champions League, it’s not always easy to find these minutes unless sometimes we are ahead 4-0 or 5-0, but I think that has only happened once all season.“ Chiesa has lost his place on the national team. Leaving Liverpool could increase his chances of regaining Luciano Spalletti’s trust, so a January return to Italy could be a genuine possibility for the versatile forward.

According to Sky Sport via Calciomercato, the Roma loanee left the hospital on Friday afternoon after recovering from cardiac arrest. Bove underwent surgery on December 10 for the implantation of the removable subcutaneous defibrillator. The subcutaneous defibrillator implanted is removable, and Bove will have the option to keep it or have it removed based on the results of future medical evaluations. The 22-year-old collapsed on the pitch in a Serie A meeting between Fiorentina and Inter on December 1. Heart-stopping moments at Stadio Artemio Franchi sent shockwaves through the football community in Italy and abroad. Quickly after being admitted to the hospital, the Fiorentina youngster spent a couple of days in the intensive care unit of Careggi before being transferred to the UTC. Thankfully, Bove has fully recovered and is ready to return to Viola Park to greet his teammates and manager, Raffaele Palladino. However, Bove’s career in Serie A is over. He will no longer be allowed to compete in professional sports in Italy, mirroring the case of Christian Eriksen, who had to leave Inter in 2021. The Fiorentina starlet must wait to receive comprehensive documentation from his tests, which will determine whether his myocarditis is genetic or inflammatory in origin, helping to assess the potential risks he might face moving forward. As for Fiorentina, they’ll likely dive back into the market this winter to strengthen Palladino’s midfield options amid La Viola’s incredible season in Serie A.

Claudio Ranieri will influence the choice, as he’ll become a consultant to the ownership next year.

We want to do it in advance and be very coherent. The two things are intertwined. The sooner the better. I don’t know whether it’ll be an Italian or a foreigner, but his identity is important.” According to Sky (via Tuttomercatoweb), Roma contemplating some elite choices. They covet Massimiliano Allegri, who denied past links and will take his time. The Giallorossi are testing the waters for Carlo Ancelotti, who’s not certain to stay at Real Madrid past this campaign. He previously voiced his desire to helm the capital club before retiring after playing for it for eight years. La Lupa is also keen on Vincenzo Montella, who was a candidate to take over midseason. However, the timing wasn’t right to poach him from Turkey. He already helmed them earlier in his career. The current ownership has tried with a middle-of-road foreigner, a big personality a little over the hill, an up-and-comer who was ousted too soon, and that bridge seems to have been burned for good, and a gritty manager who had done well in the minnows. It’s hard to find anybody with no drawbacks and who would have universal acclaim, but that should be the goal. They’ll be able to lure a big name with their spending.

By virtue of their 3-0 over Braga in the Europa League yesterday, Claudio Ranieri and Roma accomplished something the Giallorossi hadn't managed since last April: They won two matches in a row. Yes, my dear friends, it's been eight grueling months since the capital club won back-to-back matches. Last April, under Daniele De Rossi's watchful eye, the club won three consecutive matches in the middle of that month before floundering, winning only two of their final nine matches in all competitions. Time will tell whether Ranieri can use these victories as a springboard to greater success, but as we prepare to close the books on this terrible, horrible, no-good, very bad year, he has the club trending in the right direction—at long last. Related Thanks to yesterday's victory, Roma will qualify for the Europa League Knockout Phase Play-offs, giving the Giallorossi a chance to extend their European adventure into 2025. However, before we fret about Roma's path to the Knockout Phase, let's pass out some halos! The leader in the clubhouse for players most likely to be sold for a substantial profit this summer, the 23-year-old French midfielder weathered the storm early this season and has emerged as the club's most effective midfielder. Going the full 90 again, Koné stuffed the stat sheet last night: Seven key passes, nine shot-creating actions, two goal-creating actions, six balls played into the final third, and two passes into the penalty area—all of which were game-highs for either club. Defensively, Koné went a perfect three-for-three in tackles while recovering five balls. It won't be long before we start seeing “Koné to Juventus,” “Manchester City Inquire About Koné,” or “Real Madrid to Bid for Koné” headlines, but for now, try and enjoy the show. This kid is a DYNAMO. Roma's embattled vice-captain is quietly putting together a nice stretch and was integral in the club's victory last night. While Mancini was sound behind the ball, to the tune of two tackles and three clearances, he was surprisingly instrumental in the Giallorossi's attack. In 90 minutes, Mancini chipped in four key passes, including two big chances created per Sofascore, while adding two balls into the final third, one into the penalty area, and even an accurate cross into the penalty area for good measure. While he's still wet behind the ears, Saud made a case for more playing time yesterday. Getting the start ahead of Zeki Celik, the 25-year-old Saudi Arabian international had a night to remember for Roma. In addition to scoring his first goal on the European continent, Saud showcased his speed and aggression against Braga, going two-for-two on dribbles and completing a game-high four progressive carries while contributing four key passes, five balls into the final third and chipping in seven shot-creating actions, second only to Koné. If the smile on his face and the warm embrace he received from Ranieri after scoring a cracking 10th-minute goal weren't indication enough, Pellegrini was able to breathe a sigh of relief last night. The subject of increasing scrutiny and transfer speculation, Roma's captain turned back the clock last night, turning in a vintage performance. In addition to his goal, Pellegrini added five shots on goal, four shot-creating actions, two progressive carries, and five recoveries to his tally. It was another solid performance from the Ivorian, who, like Mancini, attacked nearly as much as he defended against Braga. In addition to helping Roma keep a clean sheet yesterday, Ndicka was instrumental in the passing game, racking up five shot-creating actions, two goal-creating actions, one key pass, and three balls played into the final third. In 73 minutes, the German center-back put on another show for Giallorossi supporters, reeling off 13 defensive actions, including seven clearances and a last-man tackle. Hummels also added four shot-creating actions, five balls played into the final third, and six duels won to the mix. At this point, I think we may need to start considering handing him a new deal. He's showing zero signs of slowing down. It was a night for the marginalized in Rome. Much like Pellegrini and Mancini, Zalewski has been under enormous pressure this season, finding himself on the outside looking in as the club tries in vain to find a taker for the young Polish winger. But in 90 minutes against Braga, Zalewksi reminded us of what he could be: five shot-creating actions, three key passes, four progressive carries, and five defensive actions. It's probably not enough to secure his future with the club, but it's a reminder that he can be an effective piece when focused. Considering how lopsided the scoreline was (and how much more it could have been), we'll stow away the pitchforks and head straight into our post-match purgatory. These fellas played well (really well, in some instances) but didn't stand out quite as much as their peers. That's it for today's Sinners & Saints, but check back with us this weekend when we break down the club's performance against Como. Gambling Problem? Call 1-800-GAMBLER (1-800-426-2537).

People only need to know that I’m myself inside and out in front or behind the cameras, and that won’t change.” Pellegrini was quizzed about leaving the team. “I don’t think so.

To get something wrapped during Zona Cesarini means to get it done in the last possible minute, right before a deadline, and often when there are not many chances left. It has become a common saying in modern Italian and, of course, draws its origin from a football field. The man who gave his name to the Zona is Renato Cesarini, an Argentine-Italian footballer who played in the Belpaese for six years between 1929 and 1935. He was born in Senigallia in the Marche region but moved to Argentina with his family soon after. That’s where he was raised, and where he started to play football as a midfielder or a striker. In 1929, he joined Juventus and was a key part of the Bianconeri lineup that became known as the Juve del Quinquennio – Juventus’ first winning dynasty that clinched the Scudetto five times in a row between 1930 and 1935. Now, Cesarini was a very good striker but not a phenomenal one. He would have likely not claimed his place in the history of Serie A, if it wasn’t for his peculiar ability to score…in the last minute! He did so twice in the space of a few days, and a journalist’s creativity did the rest. On December 13, 1931, Italy faced Hungary at the legendary Filadelfia Stadium in Turin for an International Cup matchup. Upfront, Vittorio Pozzo’s Azzurri lined up Cesarini. It was common practice back in the days to borrow Argentine players with Italian heritage. Italy took a double lead thanks to two more Argentine-born players, Julio Libonatti and Raimundo Orsi, but the Hungarians fought back and made it 2-2. Guess who came to the rescue for Italy on 90 minutes? But Cesarini had happened to score in the last minute even a few days earlier, making it 3-0 for Juventus in a league matchup against Alessandria. That was not a decisive goal, but apparently it was enough to get the trend noticed. When Roma’s Rodolfo Volk netted a last-gasp goal against Inter a few days after the Azzurri’s game, journalist Eugenio Danese found it appropriate to write that he had scored during “Cesarini Time”. The legend was born. Cesarini came back to Argentina after five seasons at Juve, during which he scored 46 games out of 128 caps. He might not have been the greatest striker to ever wear a black-and-white jersey but, as the Italian writer Alessandro Baricco once said about him, “When you manage to give your name to a piece of Time, you must have done something good in life.” Even the Serie A recognized that as, since 2016, the “Cesarini Trophy” is awarded to the player who scored in the latest minute during the previous league season… Your email address will not be published.

Earlier today, the midfielder was linked with a move to Galatasaray and there were suggestions that his relationship with Claudio Ranieri wasn’t turning out to be great. But the midfielder scored in the win and did well, breaking his duck for the Giallorossi. After the game, he was asked about his future and in certain terms, he stated that he will not leave. He told Sky, as relayed VoceGiallorossa: “I don’t think so. Beyond the stupidities that remain such that they mean little to me, I think about the good of Roma and if the good of Roma is that I stay here, I will stay here.” There has been talk about how Pellegrini is a ‘coach eater’ and he was asked about the suggestions. He said: “I am not one who lets people know me well, I am a reserved person. What people need to know is that I am myself both on and off the pitch. I like being like this and I will certainly remain like this.” When asked about how he has solved his problems, Pellegrini said: “This period has certainly helped me and today it was so nice to free myself a bit. I’m happy because we’re continuing on the right path, then my goal came and the team’s performance. If you had asked me how I wanted the match to go I would have answered you this way.” It was Pellegrini’s first goal of the season today and it would come as big relief, considering all the issues and criticism he has faced.

Well, that’s more like it, isn’t it? Roma brushed aside Sporting Braga with a commanding 3-0 win that could have been even more lopsided, all while looking like a team. Yes, an actual team. Remember those? Cohesion, structure, players knowing where to be and what to do? Claudio Ranieri’s Roma might not be perfect, but they’re looking better every week—and tonight, they were streets ahead of their Portuguese opposition. Let’s start with the obvious: Lorenzo Pellegrini. The captain was at the heart of everything good Roma did tonight, running the show from midfield with the kind of composure and energy that’s been sorely missed. After weeks of looking like a player carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders, Pellegrini rediscovered his shooting boots as he rifled home a clinical opener to settle nerves early on. “He’s getting back to his usual excellent self,” Ranieri said pre-match, and judging by this performance, that might be an understatement. But Pellegrini wasn’t the only standout. Abdulhamid—or should I say the Saudi Cafu?—finally seems to be finding his feet. His goal to double Roma’s lead in the 47th minute was as towering as his defensive presence throughout. By the time Mario Hermoso put this one to bed with a stoppage time goal, Romanisti had to start thinking that good vibes might just be back on the menu. Of course, it’s still early days in the Ranieri Renaissance. Ranieri admitted as much today, stating that “We’re at the beginning of the story.” But for the first time in a while, this story—this mix of veteran stability and youthful promise—feels like one that just might be worth sticking with. Players like Matias Soulé, who Ranieri dubbed “the future,” might not have starred tonight, but their time will come. And while Tommaso Baldanzi did not appear, the squad’s depth and team cohesion are promising signs for what’s to come. It certainly feels like a night-and-day shift from the nadir of the Ivan Jurić era. Next up for the Giallorossi comes a trip to beautiful Como. This one be a different test entirely, more in line with Roma’s last Serie A match against Lecce. For now, though, let’s savor this win. After all, for the first time in forever, Roma aren’t just winning—they’re playing like a team.
